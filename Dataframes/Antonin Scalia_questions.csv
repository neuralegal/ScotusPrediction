0,"Antonin Scalia  When you say traditionally it's been understood to mean real interest rate plus time value of money, it means real interest rate for the particular lender.  Isn't...  I mean, the...  the interest rate that is given to different lenders is not always the same.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's right, but the interest rate that I have to pay when I buy a house with a very small down payment is much higher than the interest I have to pay if I make a much larger down payment.   Antonin Scalia  And the interest I have to pay, if I make, you know, over $200,000 a year is less than I would get if I have a lower income.  So you can't just speak of a fair interest rate in the abstract as though it's a...  it...  it's a platonic number floating out there.  It certainly depends upon the solvency and...  and the record of payment of the person paying the interest.  Isn't that right?   Antonin Scalia  I'm surprised to hear you saying this because I thought your brief acknowledged that even after you begin with the...  with a discount rate, you know, the...  the Fed's discount rate...  I thought your briefs acknowledged that the bankruptcy court could add to that a...  a surcharge depending upon the riskiness of the chapter 13 debtor.   Antonin Scalia  You didn't acknowledge that?  I thought your brief acknowledged that.  I'm...  you...  you really want to use the discount rate, period, and nothing...  nothing tagged on top of it.   Antonin Scalia  You think that makes this a better...  a better borrower?  It...  it makes it a safer loan when you're...  when you're...  you're owed money by somebody who has already been through bankruptcy once?  You think you're in better shape?   Antonin Scalia  Gee, that's...  that's a novel approach.   Antonin Scalia  It's still not a very good risk.  I mean, you...   Antonin Scalia  you lend money to somebody.  Your chances of getting it back are 2 out of 3?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think it's better than 2 out of 3.   Antonin Scalia  Let...  let me ask you a...  the...  the way I see these two approaches.  I'm assuming that...  that you're...  you're willing to allow over the prime rate some addition which the...  the courts that...  that follow your...  your favored approach do allow for risk factor.  So under your theory, you take the prime rate, and then it is up to the bankruptcy judge to assess what the risk is, something that I think judges are probably not very well qualified to do.  You know when...  when you pick the prime rate, that that's not the market rate.  It obviously isn't.  So it's well below the market rate.  I mean, here you had a 21 percent loan and you're going to take what?   Antonin Scalia  I don't know.   Antonin Scalia  A prime rate of 8 percent at most?  You know it's wrong.  And then the bankruptcy judge has to make it right.  Okay?  Under the other approach, you take the market rate, the rate that was actually adopted between these...  these two people operating in a free market.  Now, it...  it may be...  may be high, it may be low.  You don't know for sure that it's either one.  It's...  it's...  it may be accurate.  It is not surely inaccurate the way picking the prime is.  And then the adjustment to be made by the bankruptcy judge is much less.  If there are some special factors that show a lesser risk now than there was when the loan was originally made, he might take them into account.  Now, as I see it, the less discretion that is left to the bankruptcy judge and the more weight that is given to the...  to the real forces of the operating market, the better off we are.  I...  I don't think that bankruptcy judges are very good risk calculators.   Antonin Scalia  I'm talking about using the rate of the loan that was actually made.   Antonin Scalia  No, but he has to be given the current value of his security and the current value of his security, which is not going to be received 20 years from now or 5 years from now, depends upon how much of a credit risk there is that that money will actually be paid.   Antonin Scalia  In...  in an open market.  And if the debtor could have gotten...  it's a very competitive market, as I understand it.  And if the debtor could have gotten a lower rate elsewhere, he presumably would have.   Antonin Scalia  I'm just saying that that's...  that that's a reasonable starting point.  Now, if there has to be an adjustment because market rates have gone down since then, that minor adjustment can be made, but that's going to be much less of an adjustment than you're going to have to leave to the bankruptcy judge if you begin with the prime rate which you know is wrong.  You know that nobody would have made this...  this car loan at the prime rate.   Antonin Scalia  As I understand it, your expert in this case, your economist, testified that the prime rate was 8 percent and that in his view a reasonable risk premium would be 1.5.  But he conceded under cross-examination that he was unfamiliar with the relevant rates of default or costs of servicing loans in the subprime market, which...   Antonin Scalia  to my mind is conceding that he has no basis for picking 1.5 percent.   Antonin Scalia  The risk...  the risk of a prime borrower, of a fat cat borrower.   Antonin Scalia  I agree with you, and...  and the respondent is not defending that approach, but rather the approach that you use the rate of the...  of the original loan as the starting point, and then adjust it as necessary.   Antonin Scalia  Where do you get the principle that all secured creditors have to be treated equally?  Where does...  where does that appear?   Antonin Scalia  I'm sure it's true of all unsecured creditors.  I...  I don't know why...   Antonin Scalia  Start with a figure that you know for sure is wrong.  You know for sure that this person who got a 21 percent car loan because he was a bad credit risk was never going to get the prime rate of 8 percent.   Antonin Scalia  Why begin with...  with something...   Antonin Scalia  that you know is going to be abysmally low except for the fact that it will mean less money for the secured creditors and more money for the unsecured creditors, among whom is often numbered the United States?   Antonin Scalia  In this case, as I understand it, this lender always charged 21 percent.  It didn't differ from...  from lender...  borrower to borrower.  Every one of them was charged 21 percent.  That was the market.   ",02-1016
1,"Antonin Scalia  After confirmation.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  That's the difference between your statistics...  Yes.  and hers.   Antonin Scalia  And your response to Justice Breyer's question, as I understand it, is that 21 percent may not be precisely what the rate is today for a loan made 3 years ago, but it's going to be a lot closer to it than 8 percent is.   Antonin Scalia  But yours is in theory perfect.   Antonin Scalia  No, no.   Antonin Scalia  No, no.  Yours is in theory perfect just as...  as the formula is in theory perfect.  In both of them you...  you begin with a starting point, and then you make whatever adjustments the reality of the risk requires.  That brings you theoretically in both cases the perfect answer.  The only question is, as a practical matter, which of the two is likely to come closer to the correct answer, starting with 8 percent that you know is way off the mark and then letting the bankruptcy judge figure out how much you add to that, or starting with 21 percent which, you know, is...  is...  it could be high, it could be low.  It's much fairer to both parties, but then let the bankruptcy judge adjust that a little bit.  That's the question: what...  what the practical consequence is not the...  the theoretical  They're both perfect theoretically.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Brunstad...   Antonin Scalia  let me suggest a scary thought.     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Is it...  is it possible that the statute does not provide an answer to this question?     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  That since both of these schemes, your proposal and the other side's proposal, are theoretically perfect, if they are done correctly, the bankruptcy court is free to use either one so long as he comes up with the right answer.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, the only thing the statute says is what...  what Justice Breyer keeps coming back to.  You have to provide him $4,000 in value.   Antonin Scalia  No more cumbersome.  Surely, you mean it's no more cumbersome than theirs.   ",02-1016

You have a dumb police chief who's...  who's using most of his resources in fruitless roadblocks.   Antonin Scalia  What do we do then?   Antonin Scalia  Well, what...  that's what I'm asking.  What makes this reasonable that wouldn't make other ones reasonable?  What would be unreasonable?

They stop everybody who comes along simply for the purpose of asking, sir or madam, have you seen a crime committed within the last 6 months?   Antonin Scalia  What other circumstances do you need?  Whether it's raining or not?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Now, can you give me...   Antonin Scalia  a yes or no?  Is that good or bad?   Antonin Scalia  Can they make the pedestrian stop?  I mean, I'm walking along, the police says, excuse me, sir, can I ask...  I say, no, I'm too busy, and I keep walking.   Antonin Scalia  Can they arrest me for keeping on walking?   Antonin Scalia  So why can they do it with a car?  Is that what happened here?  Suppose this car were in first gear as it cruised, you know, rolled up to the roadblock and the same thing happened, the policeman said, I want to ask you, you know, sir, I'd like to ask you a question.  I'm sorry, I'm too busy, just keeps rolling on through.  Would...  would he have been arrested in this roadblock?   Antonin Scalia  He didn't stop at all.   Antonin Scalia  He kept rolling at a very slow speed and he just told the policeman, I'm sorry, I'm too busy.   Antonin Scalia  Do...  do you think he could do the same thing with a...  with a pedestrian?   Antonin Scalia  I...  I suppose part of the reasonableness inquiry has to be what alternatives were available to achieve the same objective.  And why couldn't the police just have had a big sign on the side of the road, one of those, you know, illuminated signs that they have now, which said, you know, please help us, looking for hit-and-run...   Antonin Scalia  last week, something like that.  And then those people who are willing to cooperate could pull over and cooperate and those...  those who want to have nothing to do with it can keep on moving.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not applying the least...  least restrictive means test, but surely one of the...  one of the factors in determining whether this was reasonable is whether you could have done...  achieved the same objective in...  in some other manner.   Antonin Scalia  They wouldn't have done it, but I mean...   Antonin Scalia  a roadblock is much more fun to cover.     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  But can you stop the person?

Antonin Scalia  Maybe...  maybe your response to Justice Breyer's question...  I'm not sure that reasonableness for Fourth Amendment purposes is the same as reasonableness in general.  Do you think it would be...  in general, if you're not talking about the Fourth Amendment...  an unreasonable thing for a policeman to knock on your door and say, excuse me, sir, we're investigating a crime, we really need your help, do you mind if I...  I come in and ask you a couple of questions just to help us solve this crime?  Do you think that's reasonable in...  in...  in a sense?  I guess it is.   Antonin Scalia  No, the person says, unreasonably says no, and the policeman comes in anyway.   Antonin Scalia  Even though it isn't really the policeman that's being unreasonable in the general sense.  It seems to me it's quite unreasonable for the homeowner to refuse to cooperate at all with the police in the...  in the solving of a...  let's assume it's a major crime.  That seems to me unreasonable, but even so, the policeman is not allowed to come into the home.   Antonin Scalia  And so also here.  It might be very unreasonable for the person not to want to cooperate, and it might be quite reasonable for the policeman to seek the cooperation, but that doesn't necessarily answer the Fourth Amendment question.   Antonin Scalia  So you think this would be different if this was a serial hit-and-run killer, right?  He does one a week.  Then...  then you think it'd be a different situation and maybe they could conduct the...  the roadblock.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but it requires a roadblock.

Antonin Scalia  Congress never said that they were supposed to operate like a business, which was the purpose of the Reorganization Act.   Antonin Scalia  It...  it did...  it did retain that monopoly and...  and the Government's position here is that the Postal Service has the power to extend that monopoly into fields that the Government did not specifically confer upon it, right?  Because the Government's position, as I understand it, is not only that the Postal Service can't be sued under the antitrust laws, but that the...  that the Postal Service is not subject to the antitrust laws.   Antonin Scalia  So it can...  it can go ahead and extend the monopoly conferred by statute beyond the...  the narrow context granted by Congress.   Antonin Scalia  What happens...

0,"Antonin Scalia  Let me ask about Saks.  It's...  it seems to me that the fallacy in the argument that...  that you...  you run and that the Government runs is that it accepts the language of Saks as the totality of what is necessary to be an accident.  Now, Saks involved a fellow who had some problem with his ear which was...  caused him harm because of the normal depressor...  pressurization of the...  of the cockpit.  And in denying relief under the...  under the convention, the Court says, no, that wasn't an accident because the cockpits are pressurized all the time, and if it...  it has...  to be an accident, it has to be an unexpected or unusual event or happening.  Okay.  Saks was not saying that that is a sufficient condition to be an accident.  It was just saying that that is a necessary condition.  Now, let me...  let me give...  give you a hypothetical and you tell me why...  why this would be an accident.  It seems to me the hypothetical closely parallels what happened here.  A man hurls himself into the sea intending to commit suicide.  There is right nearby to where he hurled himself into the sea a dock with 30 people on it and 30 life preservers at their feet, and not a single one of them picks up the life preserver and throws it to the drowning man.  I don't know why.  Maybe they're 30 libertarians who think people should be able to kill themselves.  Whatever.     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Certainly...  certainly an unexpected and unusual event.  Who would imagine that with 30 life preservers within reach of the man, nobody would throw one.  Now, would anybody in his right mind say that this man died because of an accident?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, not.   Antonin Scalia  Unexpected and unanticipated is a...  a necessary condition for...  for saying that something was caused by an accident, but it's surely not a sufficient condition.  And it seems to me what happened in this plane is exactly like that.  It is an event after the person was endangered.  I...  I don't think that this person died because of an accident.  It just doesn't make it.  And that's the language of the convention, not Saks.   Antonin Scalia  I'm willing to say that negligent conduct such as occurred here can be an accident.  Of course, it can.  If...  if the flight attendant spills some hot liquid on the passenger causing the passenger to be scalded, of course, that...  that's an accident.   Antonin Scalia  That fits the normal...  the normal concept of accident.   Antonin Scalia  What happened here does not fit the normal description of accident.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Let's say it wasn't a bystander.  Let's say that, you know, they were...  they were relatives.  They're the parents of...  of the person who jumped.  You still wouldn't call that an accident, would you?  Does it have anything to do with...  with whether there's a duty or not?  Some States do impose a duty on...  on bystanders, by the way, and let's assume that happens in a State where there is a duty.   Antonin Scalia  You still wouldn't call it an accident, I don't think.  I mean, nobody would use the English language that way.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  You know, I think there may be a public policy reason for construing accident contrary to its normal meaning to embrace in this context intentional acts whether by the airline employees or by pirates or...  or terrorists or anybody else.  But I don't...  I...  there...  there's a problem in my mind about interpreting it to...  to embrace especially negligent omissions.  It seems to me that's so far away from the normal meaning of accident that I don't...  I don't see the justification for doing it especially where it converts the convention into essentially what it was not intended to be, liability for negligence.  That...   Antonin Scalia  No, the misinformation didn't bear any causality.  I mean, the...  the...  what caused the injury here was...  was not the misrepresentation about the other seats.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Wait.  It seems to me it's... it's... the burden is on you to make the claim that a State statute applies, and you never claimed that any State statute applies.  Now, the Government here, out of an excess of caution or maybe to explain the whole situation to us, puts in that footnote, but that doesn't create a claim on your part that the State statute governs.  Did you ever assert that... that this matter was governed by... by a State statute of limitations until your merits brief?   Antonin Scalia  You asserted that it was governed by a State statute of limitations.   Antonin Scalia  So we're talking about did you ever say this claim is barred by... it... it is too late under this State statute of limitations, citing the State statute of limitations?   Antonin Scalia  Would you provide us with--   Antonin Scalia  --Where can we find that in the record?   Antonin Scalia  Where will we find that?   Antonin Scalia  Well, isn't the place to raise it in the bankruptcy court?  I mean, that's where your pleadings... that's where your responsive pleadings were filed.   Antonin Scalia  Do you have... have any cases for that, that a tax claim loses its character as a tax claim when relief is sought not against the person primarily liable but against somebody derivatively liable?  It seems to me it's still a tax claim.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I wouldn't expect you to find any.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe you shouldn't be a general partner if... if you're not prepared to know what's going on.  It's pretty risky.  I mean, that's... that's the responsibility you assume when he... it only applies to general partners.  It doesn't apply to limited partners.   Antonin Scalia  So don't become a general partner if you're not willing to know what's going on in the partnership.  I... I thought that's the deal.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what it means to be a general partner.  You're... you're going to be liable for what the partnership does.  So you better pay attention.  I... and you're saying this is unjust somehow?   Antonin Scalia  Who was responding to these letters from the Government?  The secretary?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, does she take it in to... to her boss who was presumably one of the general partners and say, hey, you know--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the Government says we owe a lot of money.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't place that kind of a burden on the partners that you're talking about.  They're entirely free not to read the mail.   Antonin Scalia  But... but the problem is they're going to be liable for whatever debts are incurred by the partnership if they don't do it.  That's the only burden imposed.   ",02-1389
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, that wasn't the basis.  I... I didn't understand that to be the basis of our decision here.  The... the Supreme Court of Iowa did, indeed, focus on whether he was advised at... about how useful counsel could be--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in... in connection with the guilty plea--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --not that he wasn't advised that he had a right to counsel.  The problem here is he was told he had a right to counsel, but it wasn't said, boy, you know, you'd really be stupid to turn it down.  That... that wasn't done.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  He doesn't have to be told that counsel would be helpful.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Maybe... maybe you... you should say that he should be advised of his right to counsel, but if he isn't, it is a harmless mistake if it is clear from the record that he knew it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even... even if there is a... a... an absolute right to have the judge tell you you're entitled counsel, if it's clear on the record at least that you were told, there's... there's no foul.   Antonin Scalia  But that you knew.   Antonin Scalia  This... this being?  This being the issue on which we granted cert or the issue of whether you have to advise him of his right to counsel?   ",02-1541
0,"Antonin Scalia  But, Ms. Wilson, you know, as to how much that requires, when we invented the Miranda warning, we... we simply required that... that the defendant be told you have a right to counsel.  We didn't... we didn't say that he be told, and by the way, the first thing counsel will tell you is to shut up, which would be very good advice.  [Laughter]  We didn't require that.  We just said you have a right to counsel.  And... and you want us to... to elaborate upon the Miranda warning as well?   Antonin Scalia  Send it back.  Do we usually do that, send... say, you know, search the record for other possible failures of the lower court--   Antonin Scalia  --that haven't been raised and then send the thing back?   Antonin Scalia  But the attorney is going to cost me $200 an hour.  Give me a break.  Let me know whether it's going to be worth it or not.  And the judge will say, sorry, I can't say anything about that.   Antonin Scalia  You ought to know that attorneys are useful.  That's... that... do you think that's a considerable help?  You ought to know that attorneys are useful?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that would be the judge's fault then in... in not assuring that he was aware of all of the elements of the crime.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, all you're saying is the judge can make a mistake.   Antonin Scalia  But I mean, even if we grant what you want in this case, judges will still be able to make mistakes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If he doesn't make a mistake, he would know all the elements of the crime.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I ask?  Like the Chief, I'm... I'm not sure that as a matter of public policy I... I even... even like what... what you're suggesting even if it were made very, very simple.  That is to say, we've gone through the elements of the crime and you acknowledge that you've committed all of them.  What you ought to know, however, is that if you got an attorney, he might find some gimmick that would allow you not to be convicted of this crime even though you have committed it.  You should know that because it's your right, you know, to know that you can get off even where you're guilty.  Now, is this something that we really want to encourage?     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  So long as you've told the individual these are the elements, are you sure you did it, why... why isn't that all that the State should require?  We want to encourage people to... to confess.  We want to encourage people, when they're guilty, to pay what used to be called their just debt to society.  Why do we want to encourage them to... to hire a lawyer so that they'll get off on a... on an irrelevancy?   ",02-1541
1,"Antonin Scalia  You say the Interior Department took that position.  How?  Was that a... a solicitor's opinion or what?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, but you're... you're in that boat too.  I mean, you... you acknowledge that if the sand and gravel was valuable at the time the patent was issued, the Government would... would own it under the mineral reservation.  So, I mean, despite the fact that you'd have to chew up the surface land to... to get at it with a commercial value.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, if it wouldn't be considered a valuable... I mean, that... that does bring you into... into contradiction of our prior cases because if that... if that were so, it wouldn't have been considered a mineral either, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. McCrum, I don't understand what your response to Justice Ginsburg's question is under your fall-back position.  That is to say, what do you do with uranium which was not regarded as a valuable mineral when the patent was issued and nowadays is regarded as a very valuable mineral?  What happens to uranium under your fall-back position?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, it is now.  It wasn't then.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, it was rare but not valuable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, you... you could say uranium only has... only... has no intrinsic value.  It only has value if you're splitting atoms.  I mean, you can make the same... the same argument about uranium.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It was a mineral in 1500.  I mean, nobody--   Antonin Scalia  --nobody disputes that it was a mineral, which is what the... what the mining act says.  The... the issue is whether it's a valuable mineral.  In your fall-back position, you're placing a lot of weight on the adjective valuable, and that... that creates problem with... with uranium.   ",02-1593
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, dirt is valuable on that basis.  I mean, people buy topsoil.  And, you know, if you're in an area where... where a lot of people need topsoil, I suppose you'd say dirt is valuable.   Antonin Scalia  Why is that?  Is it the same with gold?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So long as he uses the gold in his house, it's okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or his teeth.   Antonin Scalia  Or his teeth, yes.     [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I ask--   Antonin Scalia  --what... what are his surface rights?  Can... can the... can the Government do whatever it takes in order to get at these minerals?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --he... he supposedly has surface rights.  Don't... don't they have to preserve his surface rights when they do this?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they can just go... go in and rip up the whole... the whole acreage in order to--   Antonin Scalia  How about clay?  Is... is clay like dirt or is clay like sand?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let me get something clear about the... the Department of Interior's position.  You said that ever since 1872 they had taken the position that sand and gravel was... was mineral.  But isn't it the case that they had taken that position only with respect to sand and gravel that was removable in... in commercial quantities?   Antonin Scalia  Not all sand and gravel was minerals.   Antonin Scalia  --Well, that just... that just proves that sand and gravel in certain places is valuable.  That's conceded by the other side.  Right?  The issue was that... is whether sand in the Gobi Desert is... is something that's worth anything.  And the fact is that the Interior Department never took the position that all sand and gravel is... is minerals under the Mineral Act until when?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When was the first time it came up with the notion that whether it's commercially extractable or not at... you know, at a profit, it is all minerals under... under the mineral laws?   Antonin Scalia  You could locate it if it was commercially valuable, yes.   Antonin Scalia  That's not the question I asked.  When is it that the Department first came up with the position that all sand and gravel, no matter where it is, is covered by the mining laws?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it after... is it after 1940?   Antonin Scalia  We're not talking for the moment about what the Court adopted.  We're talking about what the Interior Department adopted.  What is there in the Interior Department that would have contradicted its solicitor's opinion?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If they find... if they find water.  They have to come in--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and expend a certain amount of money--   Antonin Scalia  --considerable money sometimes, to find water.  And if they find it, then they have the right to... to farm.  And, you know, I don't think that's a... such a terrific deal if they can be just dug out of their... of their homestead by the Government.   Antonin Scalia  If... if the--   ",02-1593
1,"Antonin Scalia  Moreover, the... the fact that this proceeding had to be brought against the State was purely a result of congressional disposition.  Congress could have treated these debts to the State like all other debts, in which case they would have been automatically discharged.   Antonin Scalia  So... so that the... the argument that the bankruptcy... the in rem nature of the bankruptcy procedure gives... gives her all the protection that the Constitution at least requires, vis-a-vis the State, it seems to me is a strong one.  It's only because of the statute that... that this action had to be brought.  If Congress really wants to discharge her from debts to the State, it could have done so by simply treating the State like all other debtors.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you... you would have no problem with Congress' amending this statute so that it reads if the State chooses to waive its sovereign immunity, the debtor has to proceed in this manner.  However, if the State refuses to waive its sovereign immunity by appearing in the proceeding, the debt will be automatically discharged.  You... you would have no problem with that, I take it.   Antonin Scalia  No. I thought you accepted that a moment ago.  I thought you accepted a moment ago that Congress didn't have to provide this special treatment of the States at all.  If Congress didn't have to provide it at all, certainly Congress could say if the State chooses not to... not to take it, not to appear in the proceeding, we'll dispense with it.  I... it seems to me the greater includes the lesser.   Antonin Scalia  The statute... the statute doesn't... doesn't require, does it, that that preferred position be established in an adversary proceeding?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I suppose you're saying this is an adversary proceeding.  Regardless of whether--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --regardless of how... how it got to be so, whether it got to be so through rule or through anything else, it's an adversary proceeding and the State cannot be hailed in in this fashion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that loss of its right automatic?  What is your answer to the question of whether, if you don't show up, a default judgment is entered automatically against you, or does the bankruptcy judge have to make the assessment of whether there's an undue hardship?   INTERRUPTING ",02-1606
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well--   Antonin Scalia  --What happens when you don't show up in an adversary proceeding?   Antonin Scalia  A default judgment.   Antonin Scalia  So how can you say... I mean, had it not been set up this way, I would assume that the bankruptcy judge would have to make his or her own determination about whether the condition of the statute had been met, but once you have this adversary system set up, I assume the bankruptcy judge is entirely within his or her rights by just saying, hey, the State hasn't shown up, the State loses.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, that... that doesn't seem to me to be elevating form over substance.  That... that's a big difference.   Antonin Scalia  Do you know any other adversary proceedings that work that way?  I mean, I suppose that depends on what the... what the rule means, but when the rule describes it as an adversary proceeding, I... I would take it to mean that if the other side doesn't show up, it loses.   Antonin Scalia  Well, is... is the amount at issue here?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but the... but the... the amount, how much it is, is not... is not in controversy, is it?   Antonin Scalia  --Excuse me.  I didn't understand that answer.  It would not be a default judgment.  It would be a judgment on the merits.  Is there a distinction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought default judgments are, for all purposes, considered judgments on the merits.  For what purpose is a default judgment not a judgment on the merits?   Antonin Scalia  You... you could say the same about any default judgment in a case... in a tort action where the tort statute, you know, only imposes liability where the defendant has been negligent.  The defendant doesn't show up.  The court doesn't... doesn't enter into its own independent inquiry as to whether the defendant was negligent.  It enters default judgment.  And the statute, just as clearly, requires negligence there as this statute requires undue hardship here.   ",02-1606
1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Moore, I'm sort of concerned about this.  Our prior cases dealing with this issue of... of the scope of Congress'... whether Congress' power under the Fourteenth Amendment has been properly exercised, none of our prior cases parse it out issue by issue.  Boerne, for example, doesn't... doesn't just limit it to, you know, to... to whether, given that there was no... no discrimination in this case, Congress could move.  You're... what you're... the State of Tennessee is entirely happy to have us change course and begin to rule upon congressional legislation of this sort, case by case--   Antonin Scalia  --whether there was enough evidence on courthouses, whether there was enough evidences... enough evidence on each of the other innumerable state functions that... that were covered by this bill.  But, I mean, that's the argument you're making.  You... you just want us to... to say there's not enough evidence about courthouses, and therefore, in this case, they can't do it.  And we'll hear... we'll hear another case further down the line about, you know, any of the other innumerable state functions that are impinged upon by this law.   Antonin Scalia  Justice Breyer's question, how can you do that, reminds me of, you know, there's a story about the Baptist minister who was asked whether he believed in total immersion baptism, and he said, believe in it, I've seen it done.     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  And that... that is surely the situation here.  We've done it before in... in each of the other cases involving this area.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Moore, you... you don't concede, I assume, that the Constitution is violated by not... not providing educational... public educational facilities that will be accessible to all handicapped persons?  You don't concede that that's a constitutional violation, do you?   Antonin Scalia  I didn't think it was.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you... you need a rational basis.   Antonin Scalia  And... and if... if the... the additional expense for constructing the buildings in... in a manner that would render them accessible to all handicapped persons is excessive, it's not a constitutional violation.  Now, it may be a very bad idea, but we've never held that that's a constitutional violation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So saying that so many handicapped persons couldn't get into public schools would prove nothing at all, would it?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, the... the commerce power exists whether or not other... other facts are... are established.  It is a power that Congress always and everywhere possesses.  Congress does not always and everywhere possess the power to subject the states to... to... to lawsuits.   Antonin Scalia  --That power exists only... only when, as... as we... we found was not well-enough established in Boerne, only when there has been a constitutional violation by the states, so why isn't that an adequate reason for the difference?   Antonin Scalia  The answer is no.     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  You don't agree with that.  There has to be a constitutional violation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The remedy may go beyond the constitutional violation, but there has to be a constitutional violation, does there not?   ",02-1667
0,"Antonin Scalia  The legislation doesn't deal with that constitutional right.  It doesn't... doesn't mention, you know, due process and... and... and courthouses specifically.  It... it embraces innumerable things.  And what you're saying is, because one of the innumerable things that it embraces happens to involve a constitutional right, the legislation is a valid exercise of... of section 5 power as to that particular constitutional right.  And I... that doesn't strike me as... as accurate.  If Congress wants to enact such a sweeping statute, a statute that... that, in effect, as we said in Boerne... what was going on in Boerne was that Congress was rewriting the First Amendment, and here Congress is rewriting the Equal Protection Clause essentially, saying that... that... that there must be constitutionally or by virtue of this... of this supposedly constitutionally remedially statute, there must be equal treatment of... of handicapped people.  And it... it seems to me it's exactly parallel to what was going on in... in Boerne, rewriting the First Amendment versus rewriting the Equal Protection Clause, and we looked at the whole sweep of... of Congress' action, not just at the particular First Amendment claim.   Antonin Scalia  There has to be an affirmative offer?  He could not have asked for assistance getting up the stairs?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a constitutional violation not to offer it as opposed to refuse it when he asks for it?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, he appears downstairs and... and he sees one of the constables there and says, you know, I can't make it upstairs in my wheelchair, could I have assistance get... getting upstairs?  Now, is that a... is that a constitutional violation not to have an elevator for him, but to say, you know, we'll... we'll see that you are carried up by... by constables?  Is that a constitutional violation?   Antonin Scalia  I... I don't understand that.  It is because the presumption is that somebody--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --He has a constitutional right for the state to provide him the means of being present at his trial.  Now, does the means have to be an elevator or could it be someone assisting up the stairs?  Now, there... it... it may be less dignified in the latter... in the latter situation, and that's a proper subject for statutory activity, but is it a constitutional violation, so long as the state assures that he can... he can be present at his trial?   Antonin Scalia  Neither was a Federal judge who could hear his lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the Federal Government brings a lawsuit or he brings a lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Neither one of them is there instanter.   Antonin Scalia  That... that... that's persuasive or not, depending on what was meant by the term discrimination.  If it simply meant that... that the handicapped were not accommodated by special provisions, such as elevators, that might be quite true, but it would also not be a constitutional violation, would it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, let... let's stay on your first one.  I'm... I'm... I'm waiting to hear what... what findings Congress made that has anything to do with constitutional violations by the states--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which is the premise for this legislation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --These two sections... these... these two things were debated and... and passed simultaneously, or at very different times?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  And... and they're... they're using discrimination to use one thing in... in one half and another thing in the other half?  That's... that's what you want to argue to the Court?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What... what do you mean by turned away?  Turned away because there was no elevator?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is... is that a constitutional violation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He tells them--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --we... we don't have an... we don't have an elevator.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So if you want to get up to vote, you have to find assistance to get up there.  It's very bad, and this legislation is directed against it, and can remedy it upon a suit by the United States, but is it a constitutional violation?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think it does at all.  Inaccessible voting place proves nothing at all.  It just proves that the state did not go out of its way to make it easy for the handicapped to vote, as it should, but as it is not constitutionally required to do.  To simply say many voting places are inaccessible proves nothing at all.   Antonin Scalia  They're not saying you can't vote, they're saying we don't have facilities for you to get to the voting place.   Antonin Scalia  I do too.   Antonin Scalia  And solve that problem by requiring access to... to state-owned hockey rinks or any state-owned buildings, whether it's a courthouse or anything else.  I mean, you're... you're talking about it as though all Congress was directing this legislation at was... was the problem of people getting to the voting place or the problem of people getting to... to courthouses.  That's not how the legislation reads.  It's all public facilities run by the state, hockey rinks, whatever.   Antonin Scalia  --Where there are no conceivable constitutional rights involved.   ",02-1667
0,"Antonin Scalia  Yes, but I thought... I thought that Cannon... we've... we've allowed Cannon to stay on the books, but I thought we have sworn off the kind of creation of... of implied remedies that Cannon exemplifies.   Antonin Scalia  It's very... it's very useful, I'm sure, but it... it could be very disruptive also, I am sure.  If I were... if I were a coach, one of the first things... especially a coach of a women's team in high school, one of the first things I would do would be to complain about not... not getting enough facilities.  This would make it a lot more difficult to fire me whether... whether I'm a lousy coach or not.  You... you would have to think twice before you fire me because I would have a retaliation claim.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Some of them specifically provide for retaliation, don't they?   Antonin Scalia  Why do they do that if, as you assert, the mere word discrimination embraces it?   Antonin Scalia  Do you think that it... it is a reasonable description of what happened... he was fired for complaining about his girls' team not getting enough facilities... that he was, on the basis of sex, excluded from participation in, denied benefits of, or subjected to discrimination under an education program?   Antonin Scalia  Do you think that... that remotely describes what happened to this coach?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but it's separate enough from discrimination that in other statutes, although Congress does create a cause of action for discrimination, it goes out of its way to create a separate cause of action for retaliation.  It's sufficiently separate, and if it is that sufficiently separate, it doesn't seem to me that you could clearly say that... that when the State signed on to receiving Federal funds under title IX, they should have known that this door to litigation was being opened to them.  Yes, litigation for... for discrimination against... against female athletes, but not... not discrimination suits alleging retaliation.  That's a whole, new area.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That could be because--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the sanction is so draconian that nobody in his right mind is not going to rehire the coach.  Of course, they're going to rehire.  I... I find it hard to believe why a draconian sanction is ineffective.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me it's... it's overwhelmingly effective.  You tell the school you either rehire the coach or we're cutting off your money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it hard to decide what they're going to do?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, it rules out this one, but it doesn't rule out the main... look it, this is a weird kind of retaliation claim.  Usually the retaliation claim is the person who has been discriminated against complains about the discrimination, and for that complaint, the person who was discriminated against is demoted or not promoted, or whatever.  That's... that's the classic retaliation claim.  And that classic claim is surely covered by... on the basis of that person's sex.   Antonin Scalia  What was the date of the Sullivan case?   Antonin Scalia  '69.   Antonin Scalia  And... and you think that we take the same approach to implied causes of action today that we took in 1969?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't know what case it is, but one of our cases, the argument was precisely made that the statute before us had been enacted by Congress before we had set our face against implied causes of action, and therefore, we should interpret that statute the way we used to in 1969, and we rejected that argument.  We said that our new rule, as to when you find implied causes of action, will be applied to all statutes, whether they were enacted by a Congress that... that thought we would go skipping along forever as we did in 1969 or... or not.  And... and that's what you're asking us to do here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just because Congress in... in the... at the time this statute was enacted believed in the existence of a Supreme Court that would readily find implied causes of action, we... we have to do that for all these old statutes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's where you hang.  You... you really think Congress, when it enacted title IX, paid close attention and said... instead of saying no person in the United States shall on the basis of that person's sex be excluded from participation, you think somebody had... had suggested that language, and they said, oh, no, no, no, that would make it too narrow.  We have to take out that person's.  I... I don't... it doesn't strike me as a... as an obvious import of not including the word that person's sex.  It's a very natural way to write it: no person in the United States shall on the basis of sex.   Antonin Scalia  Are punitive damages available under title IX?   Antonin Scalia  You... you don't concede the point that it is the role of this Court to determine whether agencies are inefficient or not--   Kevin C. Newsom  Of course not.   Antonin Scalia  --and if they are inefficient to... to raise up private attorneys general to... to fill the void?   Kevin C. Newsom  Of course not, Justice Scalia, and... and the Court knows very well from my brief that our position is that when you're talking about implied rights of action, this Court has made clear, in the cases leading up to Sandoval, culminating in Sandoval, that these sorts of policy considerations really are not relevant.

Antonin Scalia  The party is the same, and that makes it a different case.  You can't possibly say we've decided this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's... it's really... it's really quite different to say, look it, it's the same party here who was here at the outset of the trial, this very same person, and he's been here all through.  All that's happened is one other person who... who destroyed jurisdiction has gotten out.  It seems to me it's quite something different to say we had... we had one person, you know, originally with... with a certain citizenship.  That's... that same person is here.  It was bad as to... as to him originally, but now it's changed because he's changed his citizenship.  I'm not sure that that's the same situation.  It seems to me quite different.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I get back to... to bright line rules?  It seems to me it is a bright line rule, that you can preserve jurisdiction by dismissing a party.  That's very bright line.  I don't think it's very bright line to say, you know, whenever there was a jurisdictional defect which later is cured... in any way whatever?  I mean, this case involves an alteration in the citizenship of the partnership.  What about an alteration of the citizenship of the corporation?  They reincorporate somewhere else before the thing happens?  What about a... a private individual who decides to move to another State?  Is that covered?  Is this bright line when... when we still have all of these... all of these future cases in front of us?  It seems to me it is not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wasn't the partnership sued as an entity?  I thought that it was sued as a partnership.   Antonin Scalia  As a partnership.  And so--   Antonin Scalia  --So there was no jurisdiction initially over the partnership.

Antonin Scalia  I'm... this would happen in a search where there is probable cause as well, it could happen, couldn't it?  When there's... when there's reasonable suspicion, the same thing could happen, couldn't it?  And you also wouldn't have to pay for the truck?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --And that would... and that would not render what was otherwise a reasonable search unreasonable, would it?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Your... your clients weren't worried about all that apparently.  I mean, I don't think 60 pounds of cocaine was good for the gas tank either, was it?   Antonin Scalia  They're not talking about randomly.  They're... they're talking about... I... I think... I think Ms. Blatt said hunches.  I mean, there, you know, there... there are just some intuitions that agents get that may not rise to the level of what a court may acknowledge is an articulable suspicion, and they shouldn't... they shouldn't have to worry about whether they have to prove that or not.  I... do you really think they're going to do it when... when there's no reason whatever to do it?

Is that... is that disassembly?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What if the bottle's sealed?  I mean, you know, it's... it's... it's a sealed bottle?

Antonin Scalia  What... what do you do about United States v. Ross when... when you're urging your... your... your disassembly point?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now that... that was a case involving a border search statute, not... not the one at issue here, to be sure, but nonetheless what we said, to quote it, is certainly Congress intended custom officers to open shipping containers when necessary and not merely to examine the exterior of cartons or boxes in which smuggled goods might be concealed.  During virtually the entire history of our country, whether contraband was transported in a horse-drawn carriage, a 1921 roadster, or a modern automobile, it was been assumed that a lawful search of a vehicle would include search of any container that might include the object of the... of the search.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, why isn't that applicable here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, now, your... your... your position is... is... is any container, you're not just talking about gas tank, you say nothing can be disassembled.  So if I have some gizmo that is assembled and is not meant to be opened again, you say if I bring that across the border the customs agent can't look into it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They can't open it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They can't... they can't open it.   Antonin Scalia  No, but without reasonable suspicion.  I'm--   Antonin Scalia  --Yeah, but you're... you're arguing a constitutional restriction here.  Your... your argument is not that Congress has not provided the authority.  Your argument is Congress can't provide the authority.  So what, it seems to me what Justice Souter is asking is, if Congress can provide the authority to uncrate the statue, what constitutional prohibition is there to uncrating the gas tank?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, for... for no reason at all they can... they can conduct searches of... of the person, right, without any suspicion?  That's okay.   Antonin Scalia  The Gucci shoes and everything else.  But somehow when you... when you reach this... this magical, what, disassembly of a vehicle, that that has some special constitutional status.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Let's assume--   Antonin Scalia  --Let's assume it means just that.   Antonin Scalia  And... and let's assume that... that you get your injunction in a Federal district court against the Secretary of State's collection of this tax.  What is the Secretary of State to do?  His... his State statute tells him that he should collect less.  This injunction says he should collect more.  He will appeal the case from the district court to the court of appeals.  Meanwhile, what is he to do?  He is not authorized by State law, which he thinks is valid, to collect more.  It seems to me during the whole period while that... that case is on appeal from the district court to the court of appeals to the Supreme Court, if it gets here, the Secretary of State doesn't know what to do, and his collection of the tax is impaired.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that so?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then the statute wouldn't apply I suppose.  It just says it shall not enjoin.  We're assuming it has enjoined.  If your reading is correct, it should be able to enjoin because there's nothing wrong with enjoining.  Okay?  Let's assume it does enjoin.  Does that not interfere with the collection, even if you think that that's... that's all that's at issue is the collection of taxes?  How is the State going to collect its taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have a much narrower position.  Your earlier position was this whole purpose was just to protect the State's tax revenue and so long as it doesn't impair that.  Now you say it can impair that so long as it does not enjoin it.  That's a much narrower--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I thought that's what--   Antonin Scalia  Can I bring you... can I bring you back to my question which I don't think I got an answer to?  What is the Secretary of State supposed to do?  He has gotten an order from a Federal district court to collect more taxes than he is authorized to collect under State law.  He intends to appeal that district court order, but meanwhile, he has been enjoined from collecting.  What is he supposed to do?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that means--   Antonin Scalia  He believes the district court decision is wrong, and let's assume it is wrong.  What is he supposed to do while it is on appeal?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that does not--   Antonin Scalia  Suppose... suppose the State law says if these tax credits are invalidated, all other taxpayers shall be assessed an additional 2 percent to make up for... I'm sorry.  If these... if these tax credits are invalidated, other taxpayers shall be... their taxes shall be reduced by 1 percent.  Okay?  I mean, the... the State looks forward to this possibility that there will be an injunction.  What is the Secretary of State to do then?  Is he to assess everybody else at a lesser amount?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In other words, he is prevented from collecting the additional amount that he would have had to collect from other taxpayers had this tax credit been acknowledged.  The tax credit is struck down, and what the law says is, if it's struck down, you have to collect more from everybody else.  Now, I assume in that situation the district court would not be able to enjoin the collection, would it?  So all you're talking about is whether the State law is... is drafted in a clever way or not.   Antonin Scalia  But it isn't and; it's or.  Isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  But it wasn't done that way.  I mean, it's just like saying it could have been extracted by torture too, and that would have been clearly unconstitutional.

You're... you'd be totally content if we don't resolve this question that's before us about whether whenever there's a procedural default that has clearly resulted and... and with no ineffective assistance of counsel, that has clearly resulted in an injustice, you know, we... we throw away all the procedural rules.  You... you don't want us to address that and just send it back and say, well, before you get to that question, you have to resolve the cause and prejudice and then leave... leave dangling in the air the question, the significant question, it seems to me, on which we granted cert?   Antonin Scalia  Why should we... why should we not be inclined to do so?  Is it a constitutional question that we shouldn't reach?  I mean, do we have to do a sort of jurisprudential striptease and decide this one case, leaving open this question?  I don't understand why we wouldn't decide it.   Antonin Scalia  So you come back and fight another day?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that just means it made two mistakes.  Number one, if this theory that you're opposing did exist, it shouldn't have reached it first, okay?  It should have reached it second.  Mistake one.  And number two, according to you, is this theory doesn't exist anyway.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't see why it's more intelligent for us to reach the first question than the second if... if there isn't any such thing as number one and number two.  If the only one that exists is number one, it seems to me we should say so.   Antonin Scalia  Well--  --They... they were sequential.  I mean, one followed another.  Isn't what it comes down to is that he should have been... he should have been given this longer sentence for the second theft instead of for the third theft?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  As I understand it, the... the... the theft that... that was used for recidivism occurred 3 days after, right, the--   Antonin Scalia  --Yeah.   Antonin Scalia  But that... but... but... no, what you need to satisfy Justice Stevens is... is a case where the mistake unquestionably caused the outcome of the... unquestionably caused the outcome of the trial to be wrong.  All of the ones you just mentioned, it may have caused it to be wrong, may not have, you don't... the jury might have convicted him without the confession, et cetera, et cetera.  Do you have any cases where... where, as here, there is no doubt that the procedural default produced a different outcome in the trial?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Perhaps when it's clear it will always be the case that there's been ineffective assistance of counsel.  How... how could it be, you know, clear as day and ineffective assistance of counsel not... not have intervened?     Antonin Scalia  Are we free to write this code of criminal procedure?  I mean, I can understand all these arguments being made to, you know, to Congress or... or to the state legislatures for writing a code of criminal procedure, but what is... what is the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --justification for this--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --something which has never been done in... in a couple of hundred years is... is... is part of due process?   Antonin Scalia  No, but the Federal habeas court has to be relying upon some law to... to undo the state conviction, right?   Antonin Scalia  Yeah.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, you... you'd rather do it sooner rather than later, right?  You'd rather have us say let him free rather than send it back down and try it all over again?   Antonin Scalia  That seems reasonable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Albritton, let me... let me ask you this.  In this case there is a statute that would not have allowed the additional sentence to be imposed unless these things were sequential.  Suppose that wasn't the situation.  Suppose what you are... we're dealing with was a real sentencing factor of the sort that a judge can take into account under a law which says the judge may sentence from 10 to 30 years, all right?   Antonin Scalia  It's up to the judge.  And in sentencing him to the maximum, the judge makes a mistake of fact.  It is later found that when the judge said I'm giving him 30 years because, you know, he's been a really bad person in light of this background, and it turns out that background didn't exist, all right?  Would you be making the same argument here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That does make it sound like what this is is Almendarez-Torres, that... that... the... the difference between the hypothetical I just posed to you and this case is simply that the law would not allow the additional time to be imposed unless the fact was found, whereas in the discretionary case, the law would have allowed it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, how... how do you limit it to that kind of a situation then?  How... how do you... how do you give me the answer that you've just given me, that even though you... you... you show that the judge who imposed a discretionary sentence was absolutely wrong for the basis on which he imposed that discretionary sense, you wouldn't allow that to be reviewed.  Why... what's the basis for that?   Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  I just understand why it makes any sense if you've shown and can know for sure that the only reason the judge imposed the 30 years was that he believed a certain fact was true which in fact was not true, and that is demonstrated, and he said, I'm opposing 30 years because of this, otherwise, you know, this would be a 10-year sentence.  And I... there's just as much injustice there, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Albritton, it's a small subset of the state court cases, but it's a... it's a... it's a total... it's not a subset at all of the Federal cases, right?  Because we have a guideline system where, by statute, you are not allowed to impose any more than what the guidelines permit, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, unless you... sure, you... you can make a finding that... where that finding hasn't been made that this is somehow extraordinary, you cannot, by law, impose more than a certain amount of sentence.   Antonin Scalia  The sentence is unlawful if it goes above the guidelines, which is why it can be set aside by the appellate court.  It is unlawful.   ",02-1824
1,"Antonin Scalia  Pretty big point to be in a footnote.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Lest we be too sanguine about the application of that law in this context, I don't know any equitable cases that would consider make whole relief to be giving... where what is at issue is merely the payment... the failure to pay money, refusal to pay money.  Make whole relief would give you what you would have done with that money if you had gotten it.  That's very strange.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure. But all that's going on here is that the claimant was perfectly able to buy Vioxx with his own money, but when it was said by the insurer that they wouldn't pay for Vioxx, the claimant went and... went with the drug that was covered.  I have serious doubts whether we can take comfort in the fact that even if we deny relief here it'll all be okay because under traditional equity law, in a situation like that, you can... you can get whatever you would have done had you been given the money.  I don't know that that principle washes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any indication in the record whether these individuals did not have the funds to stay in the hospital another day or to buy Vioxx?   ",02-1845
0,"Antonin Scalia  What do you mean free to do it?  They would be subject to... to an appeal and an appeal to an independent authority.   Antonin Scalia  And if they didn't pay up, they would be... would be liable for damages.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  What I'm... I'm just speaking to your point of whether they're Scott free to do whatever they want.  They surely aren't, you know.  Even if the appeal comes afterwards, the claimant can get the money that's owed and the relief provided by 502(a).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They don't do what the HMO... all the HMO said is, look, under the plan, as we understand it and as we judge medical necessity, we don't have to pay for Vioxx.  Now, if you want to have Vioxx, buy it yourself, and I gather there was some co-payment that would have been given, and if their doctor thought that Vioxx was really essential, surely the doctor would have abided, you know, pony up the money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But to say that the plan condemned them to not using Vioxx is simply not true.  All you're talking about here is money.  The claimant didn't want to lay out the additional money for the Vioxx.   Antonin Scalia  But let's... but suppose they don't, do the agents of the insurers who make these determinations do they have to be admitted to the practice of medicine in Texas?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is a medical professional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they don't have to be doctors?   Antonin Scalia  But you talk about the standard of care, but they're not giving care.  They're giving out money.   Antonin Scalia  They're not giving care at all, the caregiver was the individual's doctor who said stay in another day or take Vioxx.  They care... all this company was doing was looking at the contract, do we owe any money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not giving care.   Antonin Scalia  Why do you say that?  I don't think AETNA cares whether this individual took Vioxx, or whether this patient stayed in the hospital for another day.  I don't think AETNA cared a bit.  All AETNA cared about was whether it had to pay for it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's important to the patient to know.  Because the patient when... when the patient finds out that if you take Vioxx, you'll have to pay for it yourself, the patient can then ask the doctor, look doc, is it really important that I take Vioxx or is this other stuff in your judgment as the treating physician, is this other stuff good or not... good enough.  It seems to me you want that decision to be made early.   Antonin Scalia  It is indeed.  That's why it's preempted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You've described it very clearly.   Antonin Scalia  But the statute says this, it says that it shall be a defense to any action that one... neither the health insurance carrier is... didn't control the health care treatment decision.  Which it wasn't here.  And two, the health care insurance carrier did not deny or delay payment for any treatment prescribed, or recommended by a provider.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it is clearly a condition of recovery that you show that they were in violation of the ERISA plan.   Antonin Scalia  Oh I see.  Well that's a matter of who has to prove it.  I mean if--   Antonin Scalia  --As long as you frame it as an affirmative defense, rather as part of the cause of action, you can avoid preemption?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's also a defense that I did not fail to make any delay, I did not delay or fail to make any payment due.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't that a defense?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you make a medical judgment when you refuse to make a payment.  You're deciding it's not medically necessary.   Antonin Scalia  No you're not.  You're saying even if it's not according to your standard of care, if it is not due under the plan you're not liable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Have you said that?   Antonin Scalia  It's not just an HMO, it's also a health insurance carrier.  Here, AETNA.   Antonin Scalia  You really don't think... well never mind.   ",02-1845
1,"Antonin Scalia  Did the court here say that these were the only... the only four factors?   Antonin Scalia  And... and it says that... that those factors are not exclusive.  They say they're... they include but are not limited to.   Antonin Scalia  --But not if there are... but not if there are other law enforcement concerns.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, what troubles me is you... you can't simply announce that... that the rule is you wait a reasonable amount... what... what constitutes a reasonable of time is how long it would be expected someone would take to get to the door.  You... you can't adopt that as your uniform rule because otherwise, you'd have to use the same amount of time whether there are exigent circumstances or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it takes 20 seconds usually, it takes 20 seconds.   Antonin Scalia  No.  I'm just saying the exigent circumstances would not alter what is a reasonable time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, yes, but... but that also is not affected by the existence or nonexistence of... of exigent circumstances.  So the exigent circumstances sort of override--   Antonin Scalia  --how long it would take a reasonable person to get to the door.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you say that's not enough to forego knock and announce, but it is enough to shorten the time period that you have to wait.   Antonin Scalia  Those... those are all breaks in favor of the... of the citizen.  This is a break that is not in favor of the citizen.  There... there may be some of us who are willing to twist the statute for the benefit of the citizen, but not for the benefit of the Government.   Antonin Scalia  --I don't think it's a good point at all.  I think refusing admittance means refusing prompt admittance.  It doesn't say you can come in next week.  That's refusing admittance.  Knock, knock, I want to come in.  You can't come in now.  You can come in next week.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's refusing admittance.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you... do you say that the... the property line is improper only when there are exigent circumstances or in all situations?   Antonin Scalia  You mean a... a police officer shouldn't wait any longer before he rips my door down, leaving the house exposed to... to burglars than he... than he has to wait when that isn't necessary, when the door is open and he can just walk in?   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that part of the totality of the circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  I'm... I'm excluding the latter.  I'm saying there are no other exigent circumstances, not even the... the moderate exigent circumstances that are not enough to enable you to go in without knock and announce.  There are just no other exigent circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There's no reason whatever.  All they're looking for is how long is it reasonable to wait for me to come to the door.  And you're... you're telling me it is just as reasonable for them to have to wait only 15 seconds when their entry simply requires walking in and still 15 seconds when it requires them to bash in the door.  That doesn't seem to me to be a... an application of totality of the circumstances.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I have a question just with regard to your opposing counsel's last assertion.

Well, surely you don't have to wait as long as it takes the normal person to complete a shower.   Antonin Scalia  And presumably dry himself and presumably put on a towel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't know and we don't care because that surely does not determine what's a reasonable time to wait.   Antonin Scalia  Let me... let me talk about the small apartment.  Might it not be the rule that when... when there are exigent circumstances, the amount of time you have to give has nothing to do with how long it takes to get to the door.  It has to do with how long it's reasonable to wait with... without impairing the law enforcement purpose that is threatened by the exigent circumstances?  I cannot imagine, can you, that... that people dealing with drugs are perfectly safe so long as they do it in a really big house with lots of toilets?     [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Okay?  So you have to wait 45 seconds.  They could way over at the other end of the house.  What is a reasonable time for this house?  It's 45 seconds.  So let's do all of our... all of our drug activity in... in a big house.  That can't be the rule.  It seems to me the reasonable time is what is reasonable to go in in order to prevent the exigent circumstance from frustrating law enforcement.  Doesn't that make more sense?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, you're not inclined to flush it down the toilet when there's nobody knocking at the door.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, this is valuable stuff.  You're going to get rid of it during those 7 days?  You're going to get rid of it after you hear somebody saying, police at the door.   Antonin Scalia  Well, he was taking a shower.  He probably didn't even hear them at the door.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Had he not been taking a shower, he might have been flushing the toilet.   ",02-473X
1,"Antonin Scalia  May I ask on... on the first point?  You say when State officials submit to... to a decree.  It's... it's immaterial, as far as you're concerned, whether the State Attorney General defended the... the suit or represented these officials.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  I understand that, but suppose he hadn't been and suppose it is just the State officials who appeared in an Ex Parte Young suit.  They're... they're sued.  There's no other State official who takes part in the proceedings.  Nonetheless, they enter into a consent decree.  Is it your submission that even without any other participation by anybody else in the State, that consent decree binds not just them, but I gather you say future officials in... in their offices?  Right?   Antonin Scalia  Unrepresented.  You would--  --Well, but wouldn't... wouldn't there be a question of fact in that case?  I mean, it would be odd, I... I would suppose not to have the State Attorney General there, and... and wouldn't the... if I were a trial judge, I'd say, well, is this the State that is submitting this... this settlement?  I mean, wouldn't... wouldn't there be, theoretically at least, a fact question in Justice Scalia's circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but that... but that's a waiver theory.  I mean, if you're proceeding on a waiver theory, you... you need the State there.  But let's assume you're not proceeding on the waiver theory.  You have the second ground, which is just if you have authority to enter the decree, you have authority to enforce the decree.  Now, for purpose of that argument, does it make any difference to you whether the State Attorney General is there or whether these officials have the power to represent the State?   Antonin Scalia  That... that's your waiver.  That's the waiver side of your argument.   Antonin Scalia  I frankly am reluctant to... to decide the case on that ground if another ground is available simply because that would require a case-by-case investigation as to... to what extent the participation by... by other State officials existed, whether they were authorized to participate and so forth and so on.  Whereas, your other ground doesn't require that... that case-by-case investigation, and wouldn't that be a... a much clearer line to... to establish?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have to make sure that the State Attorney General was authorized to represent the State in this case or whatever other official you say committed the waiver.  That would... that would be a factual investigation in every case, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This case might not be difficult, but I... I don't like going rummaging around in State law.  I find Federal law hard enough.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But maybe... maybe there should be a special rule for Ex Parte Young cases.  In the ordinary case, going beyond the mere violation does not offend any other provision of the Constitution, but the argument here is, oh, once you go beyond holding the officer to compliance with Federal law, once you go beyond that, you're out of Ex Parte Young and you're moving against the State and the Eleventh Amendment is a bar.  So maybe there's a special rule with regard to remediation in... in Ex Parte Young cases.   Antonin Scalia  This... this carries you so far beyond the theory of Ex Parte Young, and the theory of Ex Parte Young is you're not impinging upon State sovereign immunity when you are simply requiring State officials to adhere to State law.  They are acting ultra vires when they're... when they're violating Federal law, and therefore, you're not impinging upon the State's sovereign immunity.  But now with the theory that you're expounding, you're not only holding them to compliance with Federal law, but you're saying even when you're not acting ultra vires, when you have a lot of perfectly legal options of how to comply with Federal law, you will... you will choose this option.  And that... that is, it seems to me, impinging upon State sovereign immunity in... in a way that... that the mere theory of Ex Parte Young does not justify.   Irving L. Gornstein  --In an Ex Parte Young action, State officials like all other Federal litigants are free to enter into consent decrees that go beyond what is strictly required by Federal law on one or more issues because there is a tradeoff.  They then get less relief or no relief on other issues that they may care about.  So this is a system that benefits Federal court litigants generally, and it is also one that benefits the State and its State officials.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not worried about the officials.  Yes, the officials get a good deal.  They... they get of the suit.  They get a... a decree.  But what about the State who on our... on our current hypothesis, the State is out of the proceeding.  The Attorney General is not there and here are these State officers who are giving away a whole lot of... of options that the State has, and they're... they're saying, yes, bind the State even though the suit is just against me.   Irving L. Gornstein  First of all, we... we presume... this Court presumes that State officials, when they act in their official capacity, are acting in good faith to implement the best interests of the State.  Second of all, the State does benefit when its officials can enter into decrees that--   Antonin Scalia  Might be improper for... for the... for the trial court to go beyond strict compliance with Federal law, to... to approve a consent decree that goes beyond that without the presence of the... I mean, maybe waiver is a necessary concomitant of... of the theory of Ex Parte Young that you're giving us.   Irving L. Gornstein  No, I don't think it... it is a necessary... waiver is not a necessary concomitant because it is a component of an Ex Parte Young case.  This Court said, for example, in the Rufo case that State... it had no doubt that State and local officials, in order to resolve litigation, could agree to relief that goes beyond what's required by Federal law.   Antonin Scalia  --You should have given a different answer to Justice Souter then because certainly pediatric podiatry would further the objectives of the law to provide the medical care to... to children.   Irving L. Gornstein  Well, at some point it has to resolve a bona fide dispute within the subject matter jurisdiction of the court as well, and if there's no arguable violation of Federal law that the relief relates to, then it falls outside of what a court should enter as a decree under Rufo.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you really haven't saved us a whole lot of trouble then.  I... I frankly thought that one of the attractive features of your position was that once you have an order, that's the end of it.  You don't have to try the order when... when you seek enforcement to parse out which parts of it go too far and which parts don't go too far.  You tell me there are some... some that can go too far.  We have to look to whether this is pediatric podiatry or... or not.   Irving L. Gornstein  In general, once a decree has been entered, there's no objection that can be made at the enforcement stage other than subject matter jurisdiction.  But subject matter jurisdiction would include an inquiry into whether what was at issue in the case was... if it was an arguable Federal claim or sought to further the objectives underlying an arguable Federal claim.  That's going to be rare that it won't do that, but if it doesn't do that, the State has a right to object to that on subject matter jurisdiction grounds.  By the way, the State also has the right always to move for modification of provisions under this Court's decision in Rufo that are not arguably related to... that are not related to any arguable violation of Federal law.  If it's just a frivolous underpinning to the suit, the... the State could always move for modification and get that provision eliminated under Rufo.   Antonin Scalia  The Attorney General was involved in the case in Rufo.  You said in all of the cases that you know--   Irving L. Gornstein  No, no.  I... no.  Rufo itself was a suit against local officials, but what Rufo said is that State and local officials can enter into these... these kinds of agreements and that State officials and local officials could obtain modifications based on changes in circumstances.   Antonin Scalia  Would a change in administrations be a change of circumstances that... that justifies 60(b) being invoked?   INTERRUPTING ",02-628X
0,"Antonin Scalia  So you're... you're telling us that the effect of this consent decree, what Texas achieved by it, is it comes into court and says, oh, let's... let's not fight about whether there was a violation or not, we'll accept a consent decree, and the effect of this consent decree is simply we'll fight about this same question later.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you haven't given up anything else.  You've just said, let's... let's not fight about this.  Why would the other side ever accept such a consent decree?  It's crazy.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're just telling them, you know, just dismiss this case, and if you want to get us, bring the same case later.  Why would I enter into such a consent decree?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why don't you make a virtue of a necessity and say that that is precisely your response to Justice Breyer, that you cannot do what you want to do under rule 60(b)?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So that's your answer to Justice Breyer.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that... that leaves you with Justice Ginsburg's problem.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They gave up their lawsuit, and you're... you're... and you know, packed up and went home, and you're telling them that they... that they accomplished nothing by doing that.  They got to re-initiate the whole... the whole legal process to get you to do what they want you to do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why... assuming everything you said is true, that this goes beyond what could have been imposed under Ex Parte Young, nonetheless, you had the State Attorney General who agreed to all of this.  It was not just these individual officers.  The State Attorney General who had power to waive sovereign immunity signed this consent decree.  Why shouldn't that be the end of the case?   Antonin Scalia  Only with the State Attorney General.  [Laughter]  You haven't made another argument that... that I thought you... you would make, and that is not applicable to the waiver argument, which requires that the State Attorney General or someone authorized to act for the State is there.  What... what troubles me about... about the non-waiver argument made by the petitioner is that some of these consent decrees are imposed upon... upon absolutely willing State officers who want to be thrown into the briar patch.  A suit is brought against a... a secretary of health and human services in the State who absolutely wants to do these wonderful things for pediatric care that are not required by Federal law.  And if the State Attorney General were not in the situation, I am very reluctant to think that this official can go in and say, yes, require me to do these wonderful things that State law does not require, that Federal law does not require, but that I would like to do, signs the consent decree, and then we're stuck.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's not this situation.  Your Attorney General appeared and said, this is okay as far as we're concerned.   INTERRUPTING ",02-628X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, that's a... that's a pretty fine line.  I mean, I'm... I'm really surprised by... by your concession.  I... I would have thought a much more rational interpretation of the statute is that, yes, the State has certain obligations under the statute to consider the factors, but if they were not considered, the person who would bring them to account for not considering them is initially the State courts and then, on certiorari, to this Court.  I thought your position was that this is none of EPA's business--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that this... that this discretionary determination is given to the States, and when the States are reviewed, they should be reviewed in court.   Antonin Scalia  Well, why isn't it for... for the... for the hypothetical that Justice O'Connor gives as well as for everything else?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, assuming they weren't followed, is your position that when they are not followed, EPA can call them to account?   Antonin Scalia  So you want--  --Mr. Franklin, it's not just a question of coming into Federal court.   Antonin Scalia  It's not just a question of the agency coming into Federal court the way a private citizen would and challenging the State action.  It's a matter of the agency issuing an order--   Antonin Scalia  --which order is presumptively valid and which would have to be deferred to by the Federal court presumably unless the order was arbitrary or capricious.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you'd be deciding in Federal court whether it was arbitrary or capricious for EPA to find the State to have been arbitrary or capricious, a very... a very refined determination, to put it mildly.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But isn't that the problem?  It isn't just a matter of getting into Federal court.  It's a matter of how you get into Federal court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but the action has to properly lie in order for it to be successful, and when you have... on what basis would the agency be suing?   INTERRUPTING ",02-658X
0,"Antonin Scalia  --That's begging... I mean, that... that is exactly the point at issue, it seems to me.  Why is... why is it irrational to envision a scheme such as... such as the petitioners here propose, which is, look it, Congress set certain, absolute requirements?  Ambient air quality, you know, shall be this.  But as long as those requirements are met, below that we also want each State... each emission source in a State to be examined to see whether it is using the best available technology.  But what constitutes the best available technology under the circumstances is a very difficult question.  It involves issues of... of the State economy, as well as scientific issues.  We are content so long as each State meets the absolute standards that the statute sets forth.  Below that standard, we're going to let each State decide whether the best available technology under all the circumstances is being used.  That seems to me a perfectly sensible and rational system.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you're... you're missing the... the first part of it.  It doesn't say which is the best available.  It says the best of means and emission limitation, best on the maximum degree of production of each pollutant subject to regulation under this chapter, blah, blah, blah, blah, which the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis, taking into account these various methods, determines to be the BACT.  I mean, there it is.  Which the permitting authority determines.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a range of judgment.  This is the only provision that reads this categorically.  I... I... which the permitting authority on a case-by-case basis determines.   Antonin Scalia  Tell me again where... where--   Antonin Scalia  --On 13a.   Antonin Scalia  (4).  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  (j).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That doesn't surprise me.  You... you mention on an appropriate record.  That is one of the things that makes me uneasy about the... the resolution that you propose.  When this thing comes to a Federal court of appeals, which is not a fact-finding court, it comes on the basis of nothing except EPA's order.  We... we do not know the record before the administrative agency on the basis of which the EPA acted.  Now, if you had gone through the State administrative procedure, that record would have been examined.  That would... the action in question would have been the action of the State agency and... and you would examine the record before the State agency.  But... but the administrative action we're reviewing here is not the State administrative action.  It's your administrative action, and the only relevant record is the record before the EPA.  And... and as I said before, the court of appeals ends up determining whether it was arbitrary and capricious for the EPA to determine that the State agency was arbitrary or capricious.  You combine those two weird factors and... and I'm just dubious that this is the kind of review that Congress intended.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Square.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Hungar, you... you've just told us that the reviewing court can have the full State record before it when it makes its determination.  What about EPA when it makes its determination, when it issues its order?  What... what does it have in front of it?  It doesn't have to have anything, does it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, but it doesn't... it doesn't have to do that on the basis of the record presented to the agency, does it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did it in this case?  Is that... is that what it did?  Did it review the agency record here?   Antonin Scalia  The cap... the cap wouldn't be lower.  The total emissions would be lower.

Antonin Scalia  You want us to give text more weight than footnotes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not unreasonable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe the law clerks wrote the footnotes and the judges wrote the text.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  We... we didn't take the case to... to determine whether... you know, to determine that.  I mean, I... the court of appeals proceeded on the assumption that it did exist, and... and the reason we have the case is that it is a very important proposition of law, which the Ninth Circuit adopted, that where you have such a policy, it will not be applicable to someone who's a rehabilitated drug addict.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's the reason we took the case, and you're telling us we can't get to it because... because in fact the Ninth Circuit was just wrong that there was the policy at all.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's all right, but we would still have achieved what we set out to achieve, and that is to determine whether the statement of law that the Ninth Circuit opinion sets forth is correct or not--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that if there... if there is a firing solely by reason of policy, it is nonetheless invalid as applied to a rehabilitated drug addict.  That's an important proposition.  We would resolve that one way or other, even though your case might continue on.  So what?  We don't care whether your case continues on.

I mean, I just find it remarkable that our rules of criminal procedure would not require the service of a warrant, and indeed, if that is the purpose of a warrant, what do you do about warrants for electronic surveillance, for wiretaps?  Does... do... do you have to serve the object of the wiretap with a warrant saying, we're going to be tapping your phone, so he'll say, oh, thank you very much, you know, I'll use another phone.

Antonin Scalia  That's not true, is it?  I mean, you... you can create such a duty--   Antonin Scalia  --but it doesn't appear in the rule at all, does it?   Antonin Scalia  And then it goes on to say, and any warrants, you know, where you need a warrant shall particularly describe the... the person or place to be searched and the items to be seized.  But it doesn't say categorically that you can't... you need a warrant all the time, so there's some play in the joints.  Why couldn't we say that at least in this case where there was a good-faith attempt to get a warrant and where the affidavit would have justified a warrant, it is not the one thing that the Fourth Amendment prohibits, an unreasonable search and seizure, to go ahead with this defective warrant?   Antonin Scalia  But... but there's nothing in the Fourth Amendment that requires a warrant, even for the entry into a home, and as you know of, many entries into homes are done without a warrant when there are exigent circumstances.  Now, if... if you can say that that is not an unreasonable search and seizure, why can you not say it is not an unreasonable search and seizure to proceed on the basis of a warrant that has a... a technical... clear technical defect, but nonetheless was sought and... and would have issued in perfect conformity with constitutional requirements.  Why does that make it an unreasonable search and seizure?  I can see that it makes it a search and seizure without a proper warrant as defined in Article IV... in the Fourth Amendment... but the Fourth Amendment does not require a warrant all the time.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's not the only exception.  I mean, that's one exception that... that we've developed.  Why can't we say another exception is where you've done everything that is necessary to get a warrant, and the warrant you've gotten, yeah, it doesn't really comply with the description of the warrant there, but still to proceed that way is not unreasonable search and seizure?  It's mistaken but it's not an unreasonable search and seizure.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think when the Fourth Amendment was adopted or when the English tradition that underlaid the Fourth Amendment was... was formed, most people could read a warrant?   Antonin Scalia  Then... then do you think the homeowners would have the right to exclude the constable until he could get somebody who was literate to read the warrant that the constable presented to him?  Maybe call his attorney and say, you know, there's a warrant here I can't read, can you come over and read it for me?  They didn't have telephones.

I assume we could amend the Fourth Amendment to say, in addition to what it used to mean, you have to present the warrant at least to people who are literate.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Figliulo, do you know of any case in which an objection could be waived and yet prior to the time of waiver, the parties could not, by stipulation, eliminate the objection?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that... that holds what?  You... you think... you think the parties can waive the limitation of... of 4004?   Antonin Scalia  The parties, if they get together, can waive it?   Antonin Scalia  All right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I have trouble... I have trouble with that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can't imagine that... that you're unable to, by stipulation, agree to eliminate it, but you can... one of the parties can nonetheless waive it.  That... that'd be a very unusual--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It can be waived.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  So you think the what's his case is wrong... what was the name of the one that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I'm not sure what you're saying now.  You--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you think in Barley, when the parties signed an agreement to extend the time limit, the court should have accepted?   Antonin Scalia  In the typical case there's not a whole bunch of people who are hanging on the resolution of this issue.  I mean, what's involved here is, I mean, it... it says no later than 60 days after the first date set for meeting of creditors.  The problem is you have a whole bunch of people who don't know what their rights are going to be until this matter is settled and it... it seems to me that it's... it's quite reasonable to insist upon compliance with that time limit no matter what, because there are other people's interests involved.   Antonin Scalia  But are you--  --Except... except that it does not lead to the conclusion that they should be able voluntarily to agree to extend the time period, which... which is a position you support?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that excusable neglect?   Antonin Scalia  How do you... how do you reconcile your view about the court having such broad discretion with... with the wording of 4004(b), which says that on motion, the court may for cause extend the time, but the motion shall be filed before the time has expired?  And what you're saying is, well, it really doesn't matter, the court has discretion to go ahead even though the motion wasn't filed before the time has expired.   Antonin Scalia  I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  I don't... you're distinguishing between granting... I'm sorry... granting--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --granting a late-raised objection and granting a late-filed complaint?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   ",02-819X

0,"Antonin Scalia  We... we'd just have another case a little bit down the line, perhaps with the same parties before the Court, arguing this... this follow-on question.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  If we don't resolve it, we've essentially wasted our time.  What... what... doesn't it depend upon what the regulation means by credit limit?  It could mean that limit set forth in the... in the agreement with the credit card company, past which there is no obligation on the part of the company to extend you any further credit.  It could... it could reasonably mean that.  Indeed, that... that's what I would normally think it does mean.  Or it could mean what you want it to mean, whatever limit the company later places upon your desire to... to go ahead.  Now, why should we accept your interpretation of it rather than the interpretation of the agency?  We usually do accept the agency's interpretation of its own regulation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We wouldn't be arguing here.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you say the agency said this?  Where... where did the agency say that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What... what portion of the regulation says that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I suppose that depends on what... what time period unanticipated refers to.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  What does the commentary say?   Antonin Scalia  Where... where is that in... in your brief?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Gee, if it's that central, I would have thought it ought to have been there.  It's new to me.  Where... where is it?   Antonin Scalia  You don't know what you just said?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, sort of.  I... I'd like to know what it is that you're... you're saying makes your case.  I... I don't have the text in front of me and you say it's nowhere to be found in all of these voluminous materials that we have for this case.   Antonin Scalia  I thought your argument, Ms. Goldsmith, was that the contract provides that any extension of credit over the credit limit shall be subject to the regular percentage plus the $15 penalty.  Right?  I mean, you acknowledge that there is an agreement at the outset as to what the finance charge will be for this added extension of credit.  It'll be the regular rate plus the penalty.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If that's not your argument, then... then I think Justice Souter has to be correct.   Antonin Scalia  If that's in the contract, so what?  A deal is a deal.  If you agree, I pay 10 percent up to this amount, if I go over that amount, I pay 10 percent plus $15, if that's in the contract, isn't that perfectly fair?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you don't know whether it's in the contract.  So you can't say it's unfair.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whether it is or not, you shouldn't call it unfair if you don't know.   INTERRUPTING ",02-857X
0,"Antonin Scalia  So I... I think it's pretty explicit when it says that the accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan.  And I don't... the trouble I'm having is it just seems to me utterly unrealistic to say that his accrued benefit has not been decreased when he used to be able to work as a... as a supervisor and continued to draw from the plan.  Now he cannot work as a supervisor.  How can you... I mean, certainly if you placed a dollar value on his right to receive money from the plan, you would... you would put a higher price on... on the... the individual who has the right to work as a supervisor and still continue to draw money as opposed to the person who doesn't have that right.  I mean, the... the language just seems to me utterly plain.   Antonin Scalia  It's the dollar amount that they're entitled to which is the benefit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that means you can say, well, you know, they're still entitled to that dollar amount, but they can only get it every other year.   Antonin Scalia  Would that limitation be okay?   Antonin Scalia  No.  That wasn't my point at all.  My... my point, which I took a long time to make, was that the value of your right to money, even though you work as a supervisor, is greater than your right to money which terminates as soon as you begin to work as a supervisor.  It's a less valuable benefit.   Antonin Scalia  And that comes right within the language.  The accrued benefit may not be decreased by an amendment.   Antonin Scalia  Well, they... they wouldn't need that provision if the principle of law that you're urging upon us existed.  I mean, the... the whole reason, it seems to me, that they had to make that clear in a statutory provision is that without it, you would obviously be decreasing the value of the plan and violating the provision of whatever it is, 1054(g)(1).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but you don't... we don't have to adopt your provision to... to accord that flexibility.  All that's needed is that the plan state, when it is established, that these provisions dealing with where you can work are amendable.  Once it says that, then there's no reduction in the value of... of the benefits that the employee receives.  I mean, it's... it's just very clear from the outset that these things are subject to defeasance.  All we're talking about is a plan that doesn't contain that provision at the outset, and then later decides it wants to change its mind.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If this is so central to your case, how come it only shows up in your... in the reply brief?  I mean--   ",02-891X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Then... then you're not changing the rules when you change the rules, so to speak.  I... I thought your brief was... was candid, Mr. Gossett, and you said you couldn't... you could not do what Justice Scalia just suggested.  You couldn't say up front in the plan, we can amend it anytime back and forth the way we like.  I thought you said quite clearly in your brief that that wouldn't work.   Antonin Scalia  I thought it was 203 that... that provided that guarantee.  I thought it was 203 that prevents you from going too far in what you say you can change.   Antonin Scalia  Because of what?  Just tell me the provision that you think precludes it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I want the statutory provision.  I want the statutory provision that makes that no good.  204(g).   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You... you say that 204(g) prevents the plan at the outset from rendering itself amendable, but if you agreed with them that 204(g) does not prevent the later amendment, it would also be true that 204(g) does not prevent the employer from the outset at saying that the retirement benefits are amendable.  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I was making the point earlier that even if we find for you, the employer would... would have a way of... of solving the problem, which is simply at the outset to set forth.  Now, it's very difficult for them to respond to that argument when they say that 204(g) does not stop... does... does not prevent a later change in the plan.  How could it possibly prevent a later change but... not prevent a later change, but prevent a change at the outset and announce that you're going to make a change?   ",02-891X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Why yes?  I don't understand that.  I mean, why is it necessarily a Federal claim?  It's necessarily a Federal claim only if it's a valid claim.  It might be an erroneous state claim.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Who--  --But the... the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --He hasn't read the state constitution.  He... he makes a due process claim.  Now, you're... you're going to say, since there is no Due Process Clause in the state constitution, but there is in the Federal Constitution, we must assume it's a Federal claim.  Why?  It may be an erroneous state claim.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I don't want to have to go through the trouble of figuring out whether there's a valid state claim.  I... I mean, this is going to require a Federal court every time there's such a claim to go through state law and determine whether there is anything to this under state law.  Why should... why should we do that?  Why, I mean, why aren't your first two requirements enough?  Look at... cite a Federal case, cite a Federal provision.  Is... is this an enormous burden?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So why do you want to add anything to it?  I... I don't... I don't really understand going beyond that.  Let me ask you the other... the contrary question.  Suppose the... the prisoner alleges, I had a lawyer who didn't even graduate from law school, and because I had such a law... lousy lawyer, I lost the case and I'm in jail, and I would be innocent if I were not in jail, but he doesn't cite any cases or any constitutional provision.  Would that have... present a Federal claim?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't think so?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  General Myers, doesn't the burden on the habeas court have anything to do with this?  If... if this hypothesis is adopted, the habeas court will have to, I suppose, consider the facts and determine whether that statement of facts makes out a Federal claim or not, thing one.  Thing two, the Federal habeas court will then have to examine state court, a state law, to assure itself that state law and Federal law, with regard to this matter, are exactly the same.  And all of this is in order to save the habeas petitioner what burden?  The burden of saying Federal claim when he files his... his complaint.  What... does it seem to you a close question who should bear that burden?   Antonin Scalia  It had to do with jurisdiction, not with pleading.  There was pled in the case a violation of Federal law.  There was no doubt that the person before the Court was claiming a violation of Federal law.  What the case held was that there is jurisdiction because the... we will assume that the state court made a ruling on a question of Federal law where it relies on state law that looks to Federal cases.  That's quite different from the pleading question that you have before you.  May I ask you what you understand to be the purpose of the exhaustion requirement?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I guess in every case where the Federal habeas court has some doubt whether a Federal claim was raised, the Federal habeas court, that is, where it is not explicitly stated, the Federal habeas court will have to inquire into state law to see whether it is indeed congruent with Federal law.  Isn't that right?   Antonin Scalia  General Myers, do you have any response to the... to the new point raised... it was new to me anyway... that... that this in fact, the Federal claim was raised in the petition?

I think it's... it's... it's common to, you know, you've heard of the incorporation doctrine, which is that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and applies to the states the first ten amendments, or at least portions of the first ten amendments.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it is not inaccurate to say that... that it's a Sixth Amendment right, which has been applied to the states via the Fourteenth.   Antonin Scalia  I thought you said before that you were not defending the... the Ninth Circuit's approach.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now you tell me you are.  I thought you were relying upon the statement in the... in the brief to the supreme court that he was relying upon... upon the Federal Constitution.   Antonin Scalia  And I was going to ask you if you're relying on that now, why didn't you rely on it in your brief in opposition?  The question presented by the state was, does a state prisoner alert the state's highest court that he is raising a Federal claim when, in that court, he neither cites a specific provision of the Federal Constitution nor cites at least one authority that has decided the claim on a Federal basis?  Why... why didn't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you respond to that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --by simply saying the question is not presented because, in fact, he did cite a specific provision of the Constitution?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, we're wasting our time here if... if you want us to decide whether this brief--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you know, contains the... the Sixth Amendment or not.  The question we granted cert on is, does he alert it when he neither... neither cites a specific provision of the Federal Constitution nor cites at least one authority?  I... I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --What... we're just spinning our wheels here.  You... you said you did raise that in the EIO?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I've just looked at it.  I... I didn't see it.   Antonin Scalia  I didn't see it presented very clearly.  It seems to me--  --All right.  Anyway, what you're asking is... that's why I started at the beginning.  I thought the question was... I thought what the Ninth Circuit did was cite a case called Lyons, and in Lyons they say you do have to either cite a particular provision of the Federal Constitution or a case that's clearly a Federal case.  And then they held that the brief you pointed out to me did not do that.  Then they said, but anyway, that brief is good enough because in the lower courts or other courts they had cited the Federal Constitution explicitly.  Now on that question, I would think they're wrong, aren't they?  Because, as I started out, you can't expect judges to start going back and filing... looking through all the briefs they filed in the lower courts, or the opinions below.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You... you want--   Antonin Scalia  --You want to withdraw your... your assurance earlier that you are not defending the... the Ninth Circuit's basis for reaching its result, but just the result?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I'm certainly confused.  I don't know whether you are.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is... is--   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  If you--  --Mr. Balske, could you cite me the... the portion of your brief in opposition that you think most clearly presented--   Antonin Scalia  --the... the issue that--   Antonin Scalia  --that you are now relying on at the Supreme Court level to wit that the Federal Constitution was cited in the brief to the Supreme Court?   Antonin Scalia  Where--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once I've granted--  --It's orange.  --on... on this question, it's too late to tell me the question is irrelevant.   Antonin Scalia  I...

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, can... can we talk about that for a minute?  Certainly an action can be discrete and be compellable under old mandamus rules without being final agency action in the narrow... in the narrow sense.  Let's assume a... a requirement under... under the statute that the agency promulgate its regulations by a certain date.  Okay?  Now, I... I'm... I'm not sure that that would constitute a failure... the... let's say these regulations are... are general plans of the sort that are at issue here so that they would not give rise to any immediate right of action in that they're not final agency action.  But if the statute says that the agency plan will be promulgated by a certain date, wouldn't there be a cause of action to require... you know, 6 months after that date the agency still hasn't come out with the plan.  Wouldn't there be a cause of action to compel--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, boy, I... I think you... I think you're out of the frying pan into the fire.  I... I think it's much more useful to the Government to... to say that... that a lawsuit can't be brought as soon as the plan is adopted, which it could if you call that final agency action, than it is to say that the failure to promulgate it can be... cannot be sued upon because the promulgation is not final agency action.   Antonin Scalia  I... I don't understand this discussion of jurisdiction.  You're... you're... are you claiming that the court couldn't even hear the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You're saying there's no cause of action.  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Smith, can I... I... your opening statement was that it's implausible that there should be some duties upon agencies that are not enforceable in the courts.  I don't find that implausible at all.  I... I don't understand the role of the courts to be to oversee executive action.  You have congressional oversight committees that do that.  I understood the role of the courts to be to vindicate individual rights when they have been violated.  And what the Government is saying here is that no individual right has been violated until there has been final agency action.  Final agency action is what confers... it's... it's an action that changes the law, that establishes requirements.  And until that happens, there's no individual right.  I'm not willing to accept your proposition that... that the role of courts is to make sure that agencies tow the line.  That's... that's the President's role.  It's not ours at all.   Antonin Scalia  It's based... nobody thought that the APA radically changed the course of... of judicial review of administrative action, which had been based on the prerogative writs such as mandamus and which required an individual right that had been harmed and... and a mandatory duty to that individual.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And one can violate the... the directives of Congress without... without harming any individual, and when that happens, it's up to the congressional committees to bring the agency back into compliance, not... not these courts.   Antonin Scalia  I think all the Government is saying is that the inaction like the action has to be inaction which causes remediable harm to the individual.   Antonin Scalia  Just as that doesn't happen with action unless it's final, the Government says it doesn't happen with inaction... with inaction unless what you're seeking to compel is something that would have conferred upon you something you have a right to have.   Antonin Scalia  Let's take the Federal Communications Commission.  It... its obligation under... under its statute is to regulate broadcasting in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  You think a lawsuit could be brought claiming that, you know, for lo, 50 years, the FCC has failed to regulate broadcasting in the public interest, convenience, and necessity?   Antonin Scalia  How do we determine what's sufficiently general?  I think it's pretty... pretty general.  The obligations under these statutes seem to me quite general.   Antonin Scalia  Was that a regulation?  You... you call it a regulation.  Was it a regulation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't it have to appear in the C.F.R. if the agency regards it as a regulation?   Antonin Scalia  I think it is.   Antonin Scalia  No, but something that just... just determines internal actions of an agency is not... is not regarded as a regulation.   Antonin Scalia  Where is that in the joint appendix?   Antonin Scalia  Then... then you bring an action to require them to say yes or no.  That is the agency final action that you would be suing for.  You bring a suit saying we've asked this question.  You've diddled around for 2 years and haven't given us an answer.  We demand an answer to this particular discrete question.  You... you would have had a suit for that.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, yes.  We're only talking about the form.  I agree with that.  This whole thing is about the form.  But they're trying to make you go through certain hoops and to some point, I... I think the law should give you relief, but it has to be through the right form.   Antonin Scalia  You don't need that to get into court.  The... you're guaranteed judicial review.  A person suffering legal wrong because of agency action or adversely affected is entitled to judicial review thereof.  If you write them a letter and they don't have any other process, and they don't respond to your letter, you can bring... you can bring a lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's been clear.  I mean, I don't think that that's been unusual.  What hasn't been clear is that... is that a court can exercise continuing supervision of an agency, which is what some of your requests here would require.  What's... you know, that... that was never allowed before... before the APA was enacted because the... the courts were not allowed to issue injunctions that required continuing supervision.  And... and mandamus was a... a discrete act that... that was required.  What cases since the APA would... would you... you appeal to as... as showing the authority of the courts to... to undertake continuing supervision of an agency?  What... what's the best case you have?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In a discrete matter.  In a discrete matter, but you're... you're asking to exercise their discretion in the management of the forests.  And... and that's... that's... I mean, that's putting the... the district judge in the place of the... the Secretary of the Interior.   Antonin Scalia  Why is that unreasonable?  I mean, suppose they get their budget cut.  You know, these... these are all internal documents.  This is what we plan to do, but next year Congress cuts their budget by 50 percent.  Is a court going to direct that all of the money that Interior has left has to be devoted to your pet project--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --as opposed to, you know, all of these other things that need the money for it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How... how can they amend it?  The statute doesn't say that your plans shall... you know, given how much money you have, the... the forests will be protected.  It says you will develop management plans for the protection of the forests.  Period.  And so, if there's no money there, you still have to have the same plan.  They wouldn't be able, when they amended the rule, to say the reason we're amending is we don't have enough money to do what ought to be done.  The plan would still have to read the same way.  But... and so if the plan is enforceable, you are giving a court the power to... to put your preference right at the head of the line of all the money that the agency has to spend.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that doesn't seem reasonable.   Antonin Scalia  That happens all the time under statutes.  I mean, you know, let's assume the FCC is not doing its job.  It's not... it's not indeed, regulating broadcasting in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.  It's violating its congressional mandate.  Can you run into court and say, you know, make the FCC regulate... broadcast in the public interest, convenience, and necessity?  Certainly you can't.   INTERRUPTING ",03-101X

Whether you do or not, I guess I'll find out from reading the record, but I'm more interested in the first half, which is... doesn't apply at all.  Now, your opponent said, in response to my pointing to Brandeis on this, that to support you, as to precedent, Bacchus.  Young's Market isn't any good anymore.  As to concept, you can divide the dormant Commerce Clause into a... you have to favor out-of-state principle, which was the original package doctrine, which has long since disappeared, and the anti-discrimination principle, which hasn't disappeared.  And her third part, implicit, is, historically, this whole Section 2 was aimed at the original package part; there is not a word in any brief I saw that suggests any motive in Section 2 to get rid of the anti-discrimination principle.  I haven't found a word in support on your side on that.  So she says,  ""Put those three things together, and we win. ""  That's her point.  Now, what's your response?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, even if... I'm willing to assume that.  How does that guarantee that the out-of-state winery will not, in violation of New York State law, ship directly to minors or ship directly to consumers, just simply bypassing its cache of wine in New York?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There's no guarantee.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't... it doesn't enable you to enforce your law any more rigorously than without having a requirement for a local office.

I had not recollected it as a government speech case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is government subsidizing speech by private organizations, and it chose to subsidize one type of speech, but not another.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did we say, in the opinion, that this was--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, for the precise purpose at issue here, I think it makes a lot of difference.  You can fund private people for some things, and not fund them for others, and it doesn't make whatever they say government speech.  I think that's a--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I think that's a really--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --strong proposition, that whenever you're subsidizing any private enterprise, the speech of that private enterprise becomes public speech.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's fine.  But what you were using Rust for was to establish the proposition that in order to be government speech, it... you don't have to... you don't have to say, ""This is the government speaking"".

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Rosenkrantz, the items you listed earlier seemed to me to more narrow than what I took to be the point of your opening brief, which was that the decision below was wrong because the Federal Circuit simply excluded all consideration of materials prepared for purposes of the IND, as opposed to materials prepared for the... for the drug application, later on.  Are you abandoning that more expansive position?   Antonin Scalia  Because I don't read the opinion that way.  I don't think that opinion has to be read to say that they're not going to allow in anything that goes to the IND.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Have you answered my question?  You're abandoning the assertion that the Federal Circuit did not consider anything that didn't go to the IND... that didn't go to the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --drug application.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but it... it's not at all clear in the opinion that the Court was using preclinical and clinical in the very technical sense that you were... that you use it, which means ""clinical"" is stuff submitted for the drug application, and ""preclinical"" is for the earlier application.  That is not at all--   Antonin Scalia  That--   Antonin Scalia  --But that might well determine whether the research was relatively directly related.  I mean, if I were a juror, I would... I would say it's relatively directly related if it relates to that particular compound which is ultimately submitted, and not relatively directly related if it was preliminary, trying to found out which compound to submit.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, I understand all that.  But--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I'm just saying that that is certainly one interpretation of ""reasonably directly"".  And if that is so, then you are erroneous in your assumption that the question before this Court is the meaning of the statute.  It might not be.  It might be... it might be the meaning of the instruction.   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that basic research?  I mean, I want to... I want to treat this disease by stifling the development of blood cells around it, or something like that, and then you ask yourself,  ""Gee, what would stifle the production of blood cells? ""  And let's assume there hasn't been any research done in that field before.

0,"Antonin Scalia  No, but I think... I think the Justice was asking whether it was the Court of Appeals that--   Antonin Scalia  --that applied a particular standard.  And certainly it had to have been.  Didn't the Court of Appeals have a particular standard as to what constituted general biomedical experimentation, as opposed to the kind of experimentation that's covered by the... by the safe harbor exemption?  It must have had.  I mean, how could you... how could you rule on the question before you unless you have, in your head, a notion of what the safe harbor consists of and what is beyond it?   Antonin Scalia  That's the way I read it.  It... the... and this is why I was disagreeing with counsel from the other side.  It... well, counsel ultimately conceded, you could read it not to draw the line between clinical and preclinical.  And the way you read this sentence is... the question, they say, is not whether preclinical research falls under 271(e)(1); it's whether the  ""preclinical research conducted under the Scripps Merck agreement. ""  And then the next sentence explains what that means.  The experiments did not supply information for submission to the United States Food and Drug Administration, but, instead, identified the best drug candidate.  So, I think what they're describing as the question presented is whether preclinical research that is... that is not directed to supplying information for submission to the Food and Drug Administration, but, instead, to selecting the drug candidate, whether that type of preclinical research is within the safe harbor.

Antonin Scalia  Well, we've held that they're... that the principal activity consists of doffing... donning and doffing the clothes required, haven't we?   Antonin Scalia  They felt otherwise.   Antonin Scalia  Not necessarily excluded.  It's really noncommittal on the point.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Phillips, can I call your attention to the text of Section 254(a)?  It's in the red brief in the Alvarez case, at App. 1.  What it... what it says is that you don't have to pay overtime compensation or minimum wages or on account of any of the following activities: (1) ""walking, riding"", blah, blah, blah.  This is (1).   Antonin Scalia  --for the  ""place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  (2)  ""activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities. ""  You're trying to sever (1) and (2), when the text itself joins them.  The activities referred to in (2) are ""said principal activity or activities"".  The (1).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How can we possibly sever (1) and (2) and say that for purposes of one, it means one thing; for purposes of two, it means something else?   Antonin Scalia  You would say that's--   Antonin Scalia  --so for all activities that are... that are integral and indispensable?  What about sharpening tools?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But your--   Antonin Scalia  --but your time shouldn't start from then.   Antonin Scalia  Where is that advice contained, that you say was given to--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Not--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --not necessarily.   Antonin Scalia  And you say that they operated on the assumption that it meant never.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me they were on notice that, although it did not, necessarily, it might.  I think you're--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you're exaggerating the effect of that statement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, it doesn't.   Antonin Scalia  The only thing specifically included in (a)(1) is walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities.  And once you assume that (a)(1) doesn't cover it.   ",03-1238
1,"Antonin Scalia  But why isn't walking from the gate of the... of the factory to the... to the place where you're on the assembly line, why isn't that integral and essential to the performing of the activities?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no, but if... once you accept the theory that the principal activity includes those things that are integral, you can say walking from the gate of the plant to the assembly line is part of the principal activity.  Now, walking to the gate may not be part of the... may not be part of the principal activity, but... I--   Antonin Scalia  --What if... what if--   Antonin Scalia  --Yeah, but why... if you're talking about efficiency, it may well be that the employees, instead of imposing upon the employer the costs of moving the donning and doffing location closer to the... to the place where the real work is being done, they might prefer, instead, to get a slight salary increase per hour.  But... and that is... that is possible, under the petitioner's scheme, because it is left to private negotiation; whereas, what you say is that they must pay for that.  They must pay for that walk from the donning and doffing.  They cannot negotiate out of it, because if it's in the Fair Labor Standards Act, it is mandatory.  So I... don't talk to us about efficiency.  It seems to me that the efficiency arguments are on the other side.  Leave it to the private sector.  The employers... the employees can decide what they care more about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought you would say that the whole principle of, you know,  ""Are you engaged to wait, or waiting to be engaged? ""  just contradicts the principle that was adopted in Steiner.  I mean, are you putting... are you employed to put on your... to put on your clothes, or are you putting on your clothes to do your work?  And Steiner essentially repudiates that.  So, you know, let's forget about Skidmore.   Antonin Scalia  No, I understand.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Goldstein, since you display such respect for the agency here--  [Laughter]  --what do you do about the agency's footnote that flatly contradicts your theory of the case, and which says that the mere fact that donning and doffing may require compensation does not necessarily mean that travel between the clothes changing place and the actual place of performance would be excluded?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What if I think that opinion was just flatly wrong, that Congress, when it referred to the ""principal activity or activities"", was talking about the cutting of the meat or whatever the employer hired the person to do?  He didn't hire him to put on clothes.  What if I think that?  Why do I have to extend what I think to be an erroneous decision beyond its narrow holding?   Antonin Scalia  Why can't I say that Steiner requires that interpretation of what constitutes a ""principal activity"" only for purposes of determining what is compensable, and that when we... when we come to examine the separate question, of when the workday begins, we can... we can apply, as far as precedent is concerned, a different interpretation of what is a ""principal activity""?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Is that the only basis for venue?  I mean, I thought the statute provides that's just one of the bases for venue.   Antonin Scalia  But... but read it.  What does it say?

I mean, one can understand that if the venue provision just read, a prosecution may be brought in any... in... let's see... may be brought in the district where venue would lie for the completed... if it just read, venue will lie in any district where an act in furtherance of the attempt or conspiracy took place, then we could argue about whether that is the exclusive venue or not.  But I don't see how there is even an argument that it's the exclusive venue when you're dealing with a provision which says that a prosecution may be brought in the district where the... where venue would lie for the completed offense or in any other district where an act in furtherance took place.  How can you possibly read that to say that the exclusive venue is a place where an act in furtherance took place?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay, but... but then... then you acknowledge that the place where an overt act took place is not the exclusive venue.   Antonin Scalia  Except that there are other statutes that... that read this way, which we have held to... to create the conspiracy offense, as well as impose the penalty for it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it... it could do that.  Any person who conspires to commit any offense defined in this section shall be subject to the same penalties as those prescribed for the offense.  And that could be deemed to create the conspiracy offense and prescribe the penalty for it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And there are other such provisions, aren't there?   Antonin Scalia  Let's get--   Antonin Scalia  --If that's so... if that's so, then why does the venue provision which you were just alluding to earlier read, except as provided in paragraph (2), a prosecution for an offense under this section.  An offense under this section or section 1957 may be brought in... and then it says... (2) a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section.  Not under section 371, but a prosecution for an attempt or a conspiracy offense under this section.   Antonin Scalia  I... I think that language really cuts very hard against you.  A conspiracy offense under this section.  It... it is reading as though that's the section that defines the offense, not just the section that provides the penalty.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Only because I'm a reasonable man.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I... can I ask what you make of subsection (d) of... of this provision which says that violations of this section may be investigated by such components of the Department of Justice as the Attorney General may direct and by such components of the Department of the Treasury as the Secretary of the Treasury may direct, as appropriate, and with respect to offenses over which the Postal Service has jurisdiction, by the Postal Service?  Apparently there was some turf war going on as to who had jurisdiction over these offenses and... and this was meant to... to solve the turf war, but it reads violations of this section.  Now, does that allocation of authority among Justice and Treasury and the Postal Service not apply to the conspiracy offenses under section 371?  Because that's not a violation of this section.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The offense is never completed.  there's nothing... nothing occurs except a conspiracy, and you're telling us a conspiracy is not a violation of this section.  This section sets forth the penalty... that's your argument... but it does not establish the offense.  The offense is established by 371.  If that's the case, this allocation of responsibility among the various divisions of the Government doesn't apply to conspiracy prosecutions, which would make no sense at all.

Wouldn't... wouldn't your point be when... when the reason they're investigating gives cause to believe that there may be physical danger--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --from letting people wander around?   Antonin Scalia  Which is the case with contraband, but would be the case for many other reasons as well.   Antonin Scalia  And you're saying the... the mere fact it... it went to the jury, even went to the jury without your objecting to it, does not mean we have to listen to what the jury said.  Is that... is that--   Antonin Scalia  When you... is your objection that the jury wasn't given enough guidance on excessive force, or is it that the... that the ultimate issue of excessive force is not a jury issue?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but is... is excessive force an issue of historical fact any more than... than unreasonable search or unreasonable seizure is an issue of historical fact?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's an historical fact how long you held the person, whether the person was in handcuffs, but the ultimate question was, you know, is this force excessive.  Is that any different from the question as... of was this seizure unreasonable?  If you submit the one to the jury, you may as well submit the other.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So when--   Antonin Scalia  --when you know all those facts, you're willing to send it to the jury to say, given all of these facts, it's up to you to decide whether unreasonable force was used or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not a matter of law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why... why any more so... why any... any more so than... than whether it's an unreasonable seizure?   ",03-1423

I mean, that's... that's not a fair rule either.   Antonin Scalia  It's worthless against a... against a person who has no assets.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not... not this injunction.  The question presented is whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation... in a defamation action, preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure, violates the First Amendment.  There's no suggestion in that wording that you claim that in this particular case there was no defamation.  I... I just don't think it's fairly included within the question.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, it doesn't.  It says whether a permanent injunction as a remedy in a defamation action preventing all future speech about an admitted public figure violates the First Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There's nothing about this particular injunction which is based upon speech that is not defamation.  There's nothing in there about that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why can't we say that speech that is... is being used for extortion is different, just as speech which is being used for harassment is different?  And just as you can get an injunction for the latter, you ought to be able to get an injunction for the former.  Not all speech, but only when speech is being used to... to extort money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Here I think there was... why isn't there a use of fear when, you know, you're afraid of this person destroying your business by calling you a liar and a cheat?  Wasn't Mr. Cochran afraid of that... of that happening?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Chemerinsky, let me put the question this way.  Suppose a State does not have a civil action for extortion.  It provides criminal remedies but no civil action for extortion.  Why does the Constitution not permit us to treat, in that State at least, a civil action for defamation which has within it elements of distortion differently from pure defamation?   ",03-1488

Antonin Scalia  Well, it's... it's--   Antonin Scalia  --That's right.  It's--   Antonin Scalia  --Why?  Why couldn't he just be enjoined from... from similar defamation?  I mean, this... this enjoins him from... from true speech.  At least he could... he could have been enjoined from in the future defaming Cochran in the same manner.

What... what's the big deal about extortion?  I mean, suppose this same conduct occurs in the future, but he doesn't say I'll stop if you give me a lot of money.  He just pickets every day and says Cochran is a shyster, don't do any business with Cochran.  Do you think Mr. Cochran would be any... any happier simply because the guy says I'll... hasn't said I'll stop if you pay me $10,000?   Antonin Scalia  You've got to give us some line.  I mean, the only reason we're grabbing onto extortion is that... that there's reluctance to say you can issue injunctions in all defamation actions.  Now, what... what limitation do you want to place upon the ability to issue an injunction if it is not defamation combined with extortion?   ",03-1488
0,"Antonin Scalia  Could I... I... I guess I'm not following this.  I don't know why, Mr. Smiland, you... you have not referred to the last sentence of... of what you assert was the waiver of sovereign immunity, which says any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated.  Why isn't that what you're relying on?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I... I take that to mean that when you sue one defendant and you also sue the United States as a necessary party defendant, that suit... any... that would be a suit pursuant to this section.  I... I don't know what other meaning that... that sentence could have.  When you sue two parties, one of whom is the United States, by reason of the fact that it's a necessary party defendant, that suit is a suit pursuant to this section and it can be brought in any United States district court in the State in which the land involved is situated.  I... I don't know what... what other suit that... that sentence could refer to.   Antonin Scalia  Could... could we hear your argument on... on the sovereign immunity point as opposed to the venue point?  What... on what ground do you say the United States has waived its... its immunity from suit in this case?   Antonin Scalia  Can you turn to sovereign immunity now?   Antonin Scalia  And... and let me make... make it easy for you.  Do you know of any case, other than cases decided by this friendly district judge, in which a suit has been allowed against the United States based on nothing more than the status as a third party beneficiary of a contract to which the United States has... on which the United States has agreed to be sued?  Is... is there any such case?   Antonin Scalia  And... and you think it's clear that... as our sovereign immunity law requires, that such a third party beneficiary can sue the United States?   Antonin Scalia  I... I don't understand that.  The rights were all inclusive.  As... as I understand the law of third party beneficiaries, it... it used to be... and... and perhaps at the time this statute was enacted still was... quite... quite restrictive.  It's only in more recent... I don't agree with the Government's argument that... that you have to, in an ordinary contract, explicitly refer to the third party beneficiary's rights.  But when sovereign immunity is at issue, it's... it's a different question, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  Because... because we have a rule that says when Congress wants the United States to be sued, it... it must say so clearly.   Antonin Scalia  But you haven't really achieved very much efficiency if you simply get the United States out of the business of collecting the payments and of keeping track of the payments but leave the United States subject to suit when the person who has authority to do... do these things goofs.  I mean, what... what trouble has the United States saved itself?  It would still have to ride herd over... over the person with... with whom it's dealing.   Antonin Scalia  But the... the Justice Department has no authority to... to consent to suit which... which Congress has not consented to.  I don't see how this strengthens your case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And this alone wouldn't... wouldn't remedy the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the absence--   Antonin Scalia  If--   Antonin Scalia  --No.  I've asked a lot of questions.  Go on.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think it's arbitrary not to... not to... for an agency, of which you're... you're in some sense at least the beneficiary, not to insist upon its contract rights, just as a shareholder can insist that the... that a corporation enforce its contracts.   Antonin Scalia  No, he was wrong.  That was--  [Laughter]   ",03-1566
1,"Antonin Scalia  And no money damages.   Antonin Scalia  There has to be an ongoing suit.  You think this section does... does not permit somebody to initiate suit against one party and at the same time against the United States as a necessary party.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why what is the case?   Antonin Scalia  You... that is to say, there's a suit between only two individuals and then the United States is brought in.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  That's one situation that this provision could cover, but there are other situations that this provision could... could cover.  Let's say a farmer wants to bring suit against the district, but it doesn't really know whether the fault is with the district or whether the district was... was compelled to do what it did by the United States.  So it sues the district and just in case the United States was... was responsible, it joins the United States.  Why doesn't the language entirely permit that kind of a suit?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then... then how do you explain the last... the last sentence of that provision, which is any suit pursuant to this section?  The only suit that the section refers to is a suit in which the United States is joined as a necessary party defendant.  That's the subject of the section.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and the last sentence says, any suit pursuant to this section may be brought in any United States district court.  And I read that to mean if you want to sue the United States as a necessary party initiating a suit, you can bring it in... in any district court in which the land involved is.   Antonin Scalia  What about the second sentence?  The United States, when a party, shall be deemed to have waived any right to plead that it is not amenable thereto by reason of its sovereignty and shall be subject to judgments, orders, and decrees of the court having jurisdiction and may obtain review thereof in the same manner and to the same extent?  It's subject to the judgments, orders, and decrees of the court to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.  Why isn't that enough to... to say that the court can... can award damages?   Antonin Scalia  Separate from... where does that... that obligation come from?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a State... a State-created obligation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Could you expand on the first point a little bit?  I mean, you say you don't want to be bothered with lawsuits.  Is... is that... is that all that it amounts to?   Antonin Scalia  Can't... can't such a suit be brought in State court?  I can't believe that this district can do whatever it wants with the water.   Antonin Scalia  Really?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, the suit in State court, I assume, would... would only be... the claim would be that you were acting arbitrarily, and so long as your interpretation of the contract was a reasonable one, the suit would fail.   Antonin Scalia  Whereas, this suit here... it doesn't matter how reasonable it is.  If it's wrong, it's wrong.  I mean, it's quite a different--   ",03-1566

But that's... that's not in the... that's not in the text of this statute, is it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and 1983 is not subject to that limitation.   Antonin Scalia  But are they only immune from damages action or are they immune from suit?   Antonin Scalia  So, I mean, that proves too much because they... the statute obviously intends to eliminate that immunity.  The immunity from suit is... is clearly--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, it allows suit against either municipalities or States, State or local governments.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  And the States have immunity not just from damages but from suit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Unless they have chosen to waive it, which--   Antonin Scalia  --one must assume in this area they haven't.   Antonin Scalia  So you have to regard this provision as intentionally overriding some provisions of State law in... inasmuch as they apply to... to immunity.   Antonin Scalia  No.  That's--   Antonin Scalia  --In for a penny, in for a pound.   Antonin Scalia  If they've... if they've waived--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --If... if you acknowledge that it was intended to affect their immunity from suit, why... why would we suspect that it was not intended to affect their immunity from damages?   Antonin Scalia  Does this action have to be brought in Federal court?  It says any court of competent jurisdiction.  Could--   Antonin Scalia  Attorney's fees are never appropriate, in other words.   Antonin Scalia  What about damages?   Antonin Scalia  Well, this is really a more general proposition you're urging upon us then, that whenever Congress creates a cause of action that is... what... in any respect more limited than section 1983, the background action of section 1983 is not available.   Antonin Scalia  Well, there... there are two situations.  I mean, one can supplement without frustrating.  I mean, you... you could say that in, you know... in some respects the 1983 will contradict the action that was provided, but one can conceive of a provided action that... that grants relief which 1983 would not grant.   Antonin Scalia  What... what about damages?  Do... do you take any position on whether the Communications Act provision enables damages to be collected?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think it's unnecessary to decide this case.   ",03-1601

I mean, if the suit is under 1983, it's under 1983.  There's no 30-day limit there.   Antonin Scalia  No, it doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it doesn't require you to... to establish a cause of action under some other statute either.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It does not at all.  It's... it's self-contained.  And do you know any case where we have read into, or indeed, it's even been urged upon us to read into, section 1983 limitations that somehow come from the statute that was violated and which forms the basis for the 1983 action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They... they didn't provide for the normal administrative review because they were quite aware that under the State zoning systems, there would always be State administrative review before the issue even comes up.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And so what this provides is what kind of judicial review there will be after the anticipated administrative review before the zoning board and whatever appeal from the zoning board exists.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You haven't been injured until you've exhausted your--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You... you really think that when there is a State provision available for review of the zoning board, you can commence an action under 1983 without even going through the administrative appeals?

And I think all it stands for is the proposition that the moral order is ordained by God.  That's all it stands for.  And to say that that's the basis of the Declaration of Independence and of our institutions is entirely realistic.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think they're really saying that the particular commandments of the Ten Commandments are the basis of the Declaration of Independence.  That's idiotic.  What the commandments stand for is the direction of human affairs by God.  That's what it stands for.   Antonin Scalia  If that's what it means, it's idiotic.  I don't think anybody is going to interpret it that way.  You can't get the Declaration of Independence out of the Ten Commandments.   Antonin Scalia  And I don't think that's how somebody would normally read it.  I think what they're saying is the principle of laws being ordained by God is the foundation of the laws of this state and the foundation of our legal system.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand the difference.  I mean it seems to me it would violate the establishment clause, it would equally do so if you said it's a major part of or even a part of.  Now, maybe it makes it wrong to say it's the exclusive one.  It may make it more wrong but we're not grading papers here.

All you have to do is move to dismiss because of a prior adjudication that has resolved this question.  Do you know of any case in which the existence of a prior judgment in another court has been held to render a suit that someone wants to press to get a second judgment moot?  I mean, you'd think there would be a case on that, and I suppose the reason there isn't is that because the other side is always going to plead res judicata.   Antonin Scalia  Or give up.

It may well be that if those factors you mentioned were changed, you'd be entitled to judgment here, even though the plaintiffs in Eisentrager were not entitled to judgment, but we are not talking about the merits right now.  We are talking about jurisdiction.  Certainly jurisdiction doesn't turn on the merits whether you were an enemy alien or not.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, it's a question of how much it doesn't apply, whether it doesn't apply only when there is at least clear statutory jurisdiction in one, in one Federal court so it's almost a venue call.  It isn't clear that it's been overruled when there is no statutory jurisdiction in any Federal court.  That's certainly an open question.   Antonin Scalia  You are close to the merits.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask this, Mr. Gibbons.  If the jurisdictional question rests on Habeas Statute simpliciter, without reference to the Geneva Convention or any of the other merits points that you've been raising, how then do you answer Justice Kennedy's question if the merits are out and it doesn't matter whether you are a combatant or noncombatant, is there jurisdiction when somebody is captured on the field of battle and held immediately on the field of battle, why wouldn't there be jurisdiction there?  The only answers you give are merits answers, not jurisdictional answers.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Does it say that, Cuba has ultimate sovereignty only if the United States decides to surrender?   Antonin Scalia  Where would that text be?  I did not realize that was there.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Gibbons, I'm quoting from page 8 of the government's brief, which I assume is an accurate quote of the treaty.  It doesn't just say that Cuba has sovereignty if we give up the lease.  It says the United States... this is the treaty, recognizes the continuance of the ultimate sovereignty of the Republic of Cuba over the leased area.  Now I take that to mean that they are sovereign even during the term of the lease.  You may say it's artificial, but there it is.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's the law of the land, as you say.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think sovereignty is being used in the same sense.

You're using it to show that there was available, and is available, a perfectly good check upon the executive branch.  If the people think that this is unfair, if Congress thinks it's unfair, with a stroke of the pen, they can change the Habeas Statute.

I mean, it... it doesn't... it doesn't slice the bologna that thin.  It just says they have authority to enforce the laws.  Now, if... if you say that they can't arrest in Mexico, I assume they can't investigate in Mexico.  I don't see how you can read the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --How can you read the statute to permit the one but not permit the other?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Tell me what language could possibly allow you to draw that... that distinction in the text of the statute.  There's no language that allows you to do that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --between arrest and investigation.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  I didn't like that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If that was so, why didn't he just eliminate from this as part of any foreign police action?  Why is that phase in there?  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, no, no, no, no.  But that's not--  --You... you don't think foreign police means foreign police?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You... you think it's foreign police action.   Antonin Scalia  --How is that consistent with an acknowledgement that there is an automatically self-executing brooding omnipresence of customary international law?

What if the foreign state agrees, we would like help from American DEA agents?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Under your theory, you'd say--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --this... this statute simply does not authorize foreign arrests.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.

0,"Antonin Scalia  The problem I have, Mr. Ayer, is I don't... I can accept your belief that... that subparagraph refers to all of (A) and yet still agree with the respondent here or with the court below because what... what limits the... the phrase, shall not be less than $100 nor greater than $1,000... what limits it to subpart (2) is not the word subparagraph but rather the fact that it is an exception only to (2).  The liability under little... what you've called... what... (ii)--   Antonin Scalia  --The liability under (ii) is a liability under this subparagraph, and the exception to little (ii) is only an exception to little (ii).  So I can read under this subparagraph to mean perfectly, exactly what you say it means, in the case of an individual action relating to a consumer lease the... the liability would be 25 percent, except that... that is an exception from what we've just said... liability under this subparagraph, which includes (ii)--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, that may be, but now you're... now you're relying on... on the... on the statutory history argument rather than on the mere meaning of the word subparagraph.  What I'm suggesting is I can... I can concede that subparagraph means what you says... say it means.   Antonin Scalia  Refers to all... all of (A).   Antonin Scalia  But when that phrase is used in an except clause that only applies to little (ii), it... it still says the... the foregoing liability under this subparagraph, that is, the liability contained in little (ii)--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which is a liability under this subparagraph.  Isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that convention, it seems to me, is much less strong than the fact that you don't read a word to mean one thing for purposes of one part of the... of the whole paragraph and another thing for the purposes of the rest.  If... if you read it the way you want us to read it, it would apply to little (iii) as well.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that is simply a flat contradiction.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and the... the reading given by the court below produced no flat contradiction in the terms of the statute.   Antonin Scalia  No... no contradiction within... within the statute itself.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It may have given what you call the Rosetta stone a different meaning, but it did not produce a... a contradiction in the terminology of the statute, whereas yours does.  You want us to read subparagraph to mean all of (A) except not for purposes of (iii).  You want us to do it for purposes of (ii) but not for purposes of (iii).   Antonin Scalia  It isn't straightforward.  The... the specific controls the general where there is an unavoidable conflict.  There is no unavoidable conflict here.  You--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you're urging that one interpretation is better than another, and if there were an unavoidable conflict, I would agree that (iii) would... would overrule (ii), but it is not necessary to read (ii) that way.

The... the answer is that it is not implication, that there is a new statutory text which, if it means what you say it means, has expressly repealed the earlier one.  Now, if it doesn't mean what you say it means, then I guess it's by implication.  But if it means what you say it means, there's no implication.

It's another thing to change it and come in to say that the question is clear.

The question presented is, descriptive or not descriptive, do you have a defense if it's, if there is consumer confusion?  And your position, if you're opposing the question presented, is that if there is consumer confusion, there is no defense.  And it's... I thought that was the only question you were going to discuss here, not in fact whether, if there is such a defense, it has been made out in this case, because these words were or were not descriptive.  I mean, that's a--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --But we don't usually interpret statutes that way.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Murray, I... I have sort of the same problem that Justice O'Connor did.  I find it hard to contemplate how we could have held in DeStefano that Duncan v. Louisiana, which for the first time applied the jury trial guarantee of the Federal Constitution to the States... I mean, the entire trial didn't have to be before a jury until we decided Duncan.  And in DeStefano, we said that decision doesn't have to be retroactive, that the cases decided before Duncan will stand even though the judge decided the entire criminal case, not just the... the one element we're talking about here.  How... how can you possibly reconcile that with what you're asking us to do here?  This seems relatively minor compared to the quite more massive change in accuracy, if you believe it, which... which Duncan produced.   Antonin Scalia  But... but those cases do not involve the precise issue that you're bringing before us here.  The precise issue in Duncan was the difference between having the judge decide and having the jury decide.  That's the very thing that's at issue here.  Those other cases you mentioned did not involve that very thing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The point is that they didn't involve precisely what is involved here.  The difference between having the judge decide the case and having the jury decide the case.  Our only precedent dealing precisely with that issue says that the decision is not retroactive.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Murray, we have many opinions which... which comment upon the fact that the... the line between substance and procedure is an extremely variable one and that they really are just... just two opposites in various fields, and... and where the line is depends upon the purpose for which you're calling it substantive or calling it procedural.  Now, Mr. Feldman gave us what he... what his assessment of... of what our Teague rule means by... by substantive and that is if you have changed the... the punishment or if you have changed the status of whether an act could be performed without being criminally punished, that is a substantive change.  Now, if you believe that that's what substance versus procedure means here, this is clearly not substantive.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If... if that's what it means.  Now, if... if you don't agree with his description of... of what the dichotomy is, what is your understanding of... of what constitutes something that is substantive under... under Teague?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even though the additional 5 years or 10 years for... for an act that was innocent was being imposed under the rubric of a sentencing factor rather than under the rubric of element.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it... it is substantive for the purpose of whether it's in a criminal procedure book as an element or as a... as a sentencing factor, but it's not substantive for the purpose of whether an individual knew that if he did this, he was going to get 5 more years.  It's not substantive in that sense.  And I thought that that's what Teague was talking about.   Antonin Scalia  Who don't have human frailties.  Right?  Juries... juries without human frailties.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Sollers, I thought your... your response to the problem of (b) was that (b) also requires not just... not just a risk that there be physical injury, but a substantial risk that physical force against person or property be used.

And the question we have before us is whether that terminology means it must intentionally be applied or could simply be applied carelessly, negligently, as by someone who is driving DUI.  Isn't... isn't that the... the answer to this.   Antonin Scalia  Or at least your... your proffered answer to the problem of (b).   Antonin Scalia  He's intentionally driving a car--   Antonin Scalia  --that's speeding along at 65 miles an hour.  That's intentionally using force, surely.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but we have to look down the road to the next case.  So, you know, you can't just not answer that.   Antonin Scalia  And what about a drive-by shooting into an occupied building?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  You're not sure you're going to hit anybody.  You're not even sure there's anybody in the building, but you drive by and you just shoot a... a bullet into the building.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Well, that's... that's your answer, that... that you can't interpret section 16 one way for purposes of deportation statutes and another way for purposes of criminal statutes.  And therefore, the rule of lenity does apply.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Sollers, let... let me ask you about the recklessness problem that... that a number of us have.  You... you insist on... on defining the crime of violence as one that requires the intentional application of force against an individual.  Why... why do you need that in order to win your case?  Why couldn't you just define it as the intentional... the intentional... use of a mode of force that is likely to injure an individual?  Now, driving on a highway is not... is not likely to injure an individual.  Shooting a gun into... into a building is likely to... to injure an individual.

[Laughter]  It... it has nothing to do with when you're talking about a violent act in the sense of... of crime.   Antonin Scalia  What about negligent homicide?  You... you absent mindedly don't see a stop sign.  You go through the stop sign and someone is killed or just injured.  Someone is injured through your negligence driving a car.  Is that... under your definition, that's a crime of violence.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, I think you would, and boy, that's a--   Antonin Scalia  --It doesn't have to be a felony.   Antonin Scalia  It just has to be an offense--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --certainly an offense.   Antonin Scalia  That's right, but you... you agree negligent homicide would... would be covered.   INTERRUPTING ",03-583X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, we didn't leave it up to the States entirely.  I mean, you... you mean the States could adopt any definition of mental retardation they want?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So there's... there's some minimal level of mental retardation.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  And isn't that necessarily over-inclusive, just as picking any single age is necessarily over-inclusive?   Antonin Scalia  Surely there will be some people who... who, although they have that level of mental retardation, with regard to the particular crime in question, are deserving of the death penalty.   Antonin Scalia  Why pick... why pick on the death penalty?  I mean, if you're going to say that somehow people under 18 are juveniles for all purposes, why... why just pick on the death penalty?  Why... why not say they're immune from any criminal penalty?   Antonin Scalia  I'm sure that... I'm sure that would follow.  I... I don't see where there's a logical line.   Antonin Scalia  Well, what's... what's the--   Antonin Scalia  --What is the contrary of... of mitigating?  I... I would assume--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Is it?  I... I would assume it's not mitigating.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe the opposite of mitigating is aggravating, but it... it's perfectly good English to say, mitigating?  Quite the contrary--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It's not at all mitigating.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So I don't know why you give that one away.   Antonin Scalia  Have the countries of the European Union abolished the death penalty by popular vote?   Antonin Scalia  I thought they did it by reason of a judgment of a court--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which required all of them to abolish it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I thought that some of the public opinion polls in... in a number of the countries support the death penalty.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You... you think--   Antonin Scalia  --What did John Adams think of the French?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Does adolescence as a scientific term... does it always occur on the same day for... for all individuals?   ",03-633X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Can the constitutional calculus ever move in the other direction?  I mean, once we hold that, you know, 16 is the age, if there's new scientific evidence that shows that some people are quite mature at 18 or at... at 17-and-a-half or if... if there is a... a new feeling among the people that youthful murderers are, indeed, a serious problem and... and deterrence is necessary, can we ever go back?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's sort of a one-way ratchet.  Isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't... we don't use 18 for everything.  Aren't there States that... that allow adolescents to drive at the age of 16?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  With their parents' consent--   Antonin Scalia  --With their parents' consent, how many?   Antonin Scalia  But they can drive.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it's okay with the parents, it's okay with the State.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They have a lot of customs that we don't have.  They don't allow most... almost all of them do not allow... have trial by jury.  Should we... and they think it's not only more efficient, it is fairer because juries are, you know, unpredictable and whatnot.  Should we yield to the views of the rest of the world?   Antonin Scalia  If all of this is so clear, why can't the State legislature take it into account?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, if it's such an overwhelming case that... that we can prescribe it for the whole country, you would expect that the number of States that... that now permit it would not permit it.  All you have to do is bring these facts to the attention of the legislature, and they can investigate the accuracy of the studies that the American Psychological Association does or other associations in a manner that we can't.  We just have to read whatever you put in front of us.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's precisely because the jury considers youthfulness as one of the mitigating factors.  It doesn't surprise me that the death penalty for 16 to 18-year-olds is rarely imposed.  I would expect it would be.  But it... it's a question of whether you leave it to the jury to evaluate the person's youth and take that into account or whether you adopt a hard rule that nobody who is under 18 is... is... has committed such a heinous crime with such intent that he... that he deserves the death penalty.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Waxman, I... I thought we punish people, criminals, for what they were, not for what they are.  I mean, you know, if you have someone who commits a heinous crime and by the time he's brought to trial and convicted, he's come to Jesus, we don't let him off because he's not now what he was then.  It seems to me we punish people for what they were.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And to say that adolescents change, everybody changes, but that doesn't justify eliminating the... the proper punishments that society has determined.   Antonin Scalia  Whereas if it had been done by an 18-year-old, a jury could have said that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If an 18-year-old did the same thing, you say, well, he's certainly stable.   ",03-633X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Do you know if there are in these other States the same incidents of racial riots or racial killings or racial attacks?   Antonin Scalia  Well, they say that that proves that their policy is very effective.  I mean, that's--  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What is... what is sacrosanct about the... about the constitutional right not to be subjected to racial stereotype?  There are a lot of other constitutional rights that people in prison give up.  That's one of the consequences of committing a crime and being sent to prison, the most fundamental constitutional right, the right to... to walk around and... and not be seized.  Why... why is it that this... this one constitutional right cannot yield to what prison authorities believe is... is a useful, not necessarily essential, but a useful means of... of maintaining order in prison?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, it's... it's different from First Amendment rights?  Prisoners can't hold news conferences.  I mean, there are all sorts of very important constitutional rights that I think are no more important than the Equal Protection Clause which prisoners yield when they're in prison.  Now, do we subject the taking away of all of these rights to strict scrutiny when the prison authorities do it?  I don't think so.  I think we say if it's... if it's the judgment of the... of the prison authorities, we... we generally defer to it.   Antonin Scalia  No, I don't think so.  I... why would holding a news conference disrupt a prison?  It wouldn't.  You say it's too much trouble.  We don't want news conferences in prison.   Antonin Scalia  And why is this not one?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because it... it is no... there is no doubt that there are racial gangs in prison, the Aryan Brotherhood and... and Hispanic gangs and... and black gangs.  There's no doubt that that exists.  Is it--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I don't... you... you don't need it in the record.  You... you know what the Aryan Brotherhood is.  It... it is a white group that is hostile to blacks in particular, and you know what the Bloods are.  It is a black group that... that is hostile to whites.  And... and does it take any more than common sense to know that if you put a tattooed member of one group in with a tattooed member of the other group, the likelihood of violence in that cell is going to be greater?  And is any more than that needed for... for the... for the prison not to cell them together?  Would you acknowledge that at least if the... not just on the basis that one is white and one is black, but if the prison knows that... that one is a member of the Aryan Brotherhood and the other is a member of the Bloods, the prison can refuse to... to assign them to the same cell?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  We say the same about the First Amendment, don't we?  All government actions restricting speech are subject to strict scrutiny.  Right?  And yet, we allow that to occur in prison.   Antonin Scalia  Unlike the First Amendment.   Antonin Scalia  And why should we decide the constitutional question?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it's--   Antonin Scalia  --This is not a permanent segregation in these California prisons.  It's just temporary, isn't it?  How long does it last?   Antonin Scalia  Until... until they... they have assurance that... that the individuals are... are not members of a gang and likely to, in... in their view, commit racial violence if... if co-celled with another prisoner.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it were permanent, your argument about this, you know, this is a long tradition of our prisons.  We... we keep the blacks and the whites separate.  That... that's not what they're doing in California.  It's a temporary... it's a temporary measure.   Antonin Scalia  That was for the whole stay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What does 7... what does 7 to 15 days have to do with anything?  It was for the whole stay that they were segregated.  The stay may have been short, but the fact that during their entire period they were segregated showed that there was no other purpose to this thing except to keep the races separate.  Whereas, here, they are kept separate for... for the time which the California prison believes it needs in order to assure that there won't be violence, and once that assurance is given, the races are... are mixed.  That's a totally different situation.   Antonin Scalia  They have a high class of felons in the Federal prison basically.   ",03-636X

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, but it doesn't begin that way.  It doesn't begin if an alien cannot be removed to a country under the previous subparagraphs.  It says, if an alien is not removed to a country under the previous subparagraphs.  And whether he is or not is subject to the discretion of the Attorney General.  None of those sentences or paragraphs requires removal to those countries.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So when it says if he is not, then the... the Attorney General has these additional options.  I mean, you... you'd have a stronger argument if it... if it read cannot be removed, but it doesn't.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, well, I mean, that clause could... could be read either way.  Another country whose government will accept the alien is one way to read it, and another way to read it is another country whose government will accept the alien.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's... that's the... that's the ambiguity there.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What I think is very strange is the... is... is for you to read back up to all the other clauses, (i) through (vi), the phrase, whose government will accept the alien.  I mean, if... if acceptance is a condition for all of those preceding things, my goodness, that's certainly not the way to make it clear, to tag it onto (vi) instead of putting it in the introduction or in a clause that comes after (i) through (vii) and goes out to the margin after that.  You... you want us to read back to (i) through (vi) whose government will accept the alien.   Antonin Scalia  So... so, as you read... as you read this statute, the United States can never send somebody back to a country that doesn't want them.  Is that it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why... why would... why would Congress ever want to impose that categorical requirement?   Antonin Scalia  And you say there can't be any under this law.   Antonin Scalia  So that if some state opens its prisons and puts its criminals on a boat and sends them to the United States, as has happened in the past, your interpretation of this statute is that Congress has forbidden the President from shipping these criminals back where they came from, so long as the country that expelled them doesn't want these criminals back.  Is that--   Antonin Scalia  --What... what are you saying?   ",03-674X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Why... why did you narrow the question presented in your brief if you're willing to take that... that much more categorical position and much more important position for the Government?  When... the... the question presented, as you describe it in your brief, is whether immigration officials may remove petitioner to his country of birth when that country lacks a functioning central government that is able either to accept or object to petitioner's... that's a much narrower question--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --than... than the one presented by petitioner.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's all you want us to decide?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I... I don't think it's the logical thrust necessarily, and if we... if we did it the way your question presented suggests, we're deciding this case only for people who are going to be deported to Somalia or... what other areas of the world have no functioning government?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's... I wouldn't have voted to take the case.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Not... not stacking charges you mean.   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Hart, I'm... I'm not sure what you mean by... that there has to be probable cause for arrest.  Do you mean objectively, or do you mean on the basis of the facts known to the arresting officer?  I mean, let's... let's assume an officer stops a car for a broken taillight, and it turns out the car doesn't have a broken taillight.  All right?  So that basis is wrong.  However, the car also has an expired inspection sticker, which the officer didn't know about.  Was there a probable cause for arrest, as you're using the term here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it doesn't matter whether he knew those facts and circumstances.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, so it has to be known.   Antonin Scalia  So in my example, the arrest would be invalid because at the time of the arrest, he didn't know about the sticker.   Antonin Scalia  So you're saying it's the facts known to the officer--   Antonin Scalia  --that have to establish the probable--   Antonin Scalia  --Once... once you establish that limitation, are you willing to accept the horrible that... that Justice Souter proposed to you?  Is it... is it, indeed, so easy to... to gin up some other cause for arrest when you used a mistaken cause?  I don't know that it's all that easy.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Must... must be very stupid police officers.  I mean, it's... it's just obvious what... what you have to do to make a valid arrest.  If you say nothing, any... any basis that you could have had for the arrest will... will be used.  Whereas, if you... if you mention something, you better be able to substantiate that particular cause or a closely related crime.  Police officers aren't any dumber than the rest of us.  I can't believe that... that that wouldn't be the... the consequence of... of the rule you're asking us to adopt.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  To put it this way, it seems to me the burden should be on you to... to tell us why a police... police officers are so stupid that they... that they go around and... and continue to give reasons when that's... when that's going to make it more difficult for them to sustain the arrest and subject them to... to personal liability.   Antonin Scalia  But they should have been arrested.  I mean, so long as they should have been arrested, who cares?  In this case, I mean, it'll... it'll be ultimately be tried by a jury I... I guess, but your... your client pulls up behind another car with wig-wag lights flashing, like a police car.  Right?  He has a police scanner on the seat next to him.  He has handcuffs.  He has tinted glass in front of the license plate... of his license plate, so it can't be... can't be read.  It seems to me there was obvious probable cause to... to arrest this fellow for impersonating a police officer.  And I would have hoped he would have been arrested so he wouldn't go around and... and pull up behind another car.  What is the problem?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me he should have been arrested, and the... and the mere fact that the police officer gave the wrong reason for arresting him doesn't make me feel very bad about the arrest at all.  I'm glad he was arrested.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that... that isn't the issue before us here.  I... I assume that for purposes of the question on which we granted certiorari, we have to assume, or else the whole thing doesn't make any sense and it's all... it's all arguing about nothing... we have to assume that there was probable cause on some other ground than the ground which he stated or anything closely related to the ground which... which the officer stated.  Isn't that... isn't that the... the manner in which this case gets to us?   Antonin Scalia  But... but that's not the ground on which the Ninth Circuit decided it.  The Ninth Circuit never had to reach the question of whether there was probable cause on these other grounds--   Antonin Scalia  --because it found, even if there was these other grounds, they're not closely related to the illegal taping.  So I suppose you're telling us that if we find that we do not like the closely related rule, that it's not part of... of United States constitutional law, what we should do is remand to the Ninth Circuit so that they could determine whether there was probable cause on the other grounds.   Antonin Scalia  That's not my reason.  I don't even know the man.  I'm just--  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  We don't that challenge that here, though.  I asked you that question earlier, and I thought you agreed that for purposes of our deciding this case, we... we will assume, though you do not concede the point, that there was probable cause on one of the other grounds.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Ms. Brill, I thought your brief said that we have an anti-smuggling statute, which is directed precisely against smugglers, but it only applies to those countries that have similar protection for us.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And Canada does not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now--   Antonin Scalia  --the existence of that statute would seem to suggest... and a statute which is limited to countries that will do the same for us... would seem to suggest that we don't want to do this for Canada.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there something better about reciprocity for vessels and not reciprocity for land smuggling?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't... you don't assert that this... that it... that this couldn't be done, do you?  You just--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --assert that we shouldn't assert that we shouldn't interpret this statute to have done it.   Antonin Scalia  Presumably, if we punish this person this way, Canada wouldn't... there's no double jeopardy, right?   Antonin Scalia  So we'd be punishing this person for violating Canadian law, and then Canada would punish this person for violating Canadian law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is this statute applied against people who defraud the United States Government in taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you don't... you don't know of any prosecutions under this fraud statute for depriving the Federal Government of property.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was it... was it phrased the same way it is in your brief, in the petition?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then the last part of it--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --obviously covers it.   INTERRUPTING ",03-725X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, why didn't you prosecute him for that?   Antonin Scalia  But that's... but that's a reason for extending the statute to everything.  To everything.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""Property"" can mean anything at all.  I mean, what you're saying is, the broader you read this statute, the more bad guys we're going to catch.  I'll stipulate that.  Of course it's true.   Antonin Scalia  What about evading a Cuban tax law that we think... that many people would think is an unjust tax law?  I mean, one of the things I'm worried about is that this gets us into foreign policy.  Are you sure that we always want to enforce the tax laws of foreign countries through this fraud statute, no matter what those tax laws happen to be?   Antonin Scalia  It may well, but when it comes here, this Court is going to have to decide... we'll just approve whatever you want to prosecute and let you not prosecute whatever you want?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The question comes down to whether this statute, which doesn't have to be read that way, ought to be read that way, whether it makes sense to read it that way.  What about... does Canada have an income tax?   Antonin Scalia  Well, let's assume--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Canada has an income tax.  Would you... would you prosecute a Canadian who files a deceptive Canadian income tax return?   Antonin Scalia  No, no, no, from this country.  He's... you know, he's a snow goose and is in Florida when he files his return.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah.   Antonin Scalia  Second--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --How long has this statute been on the books, this wire fraud statute?  Pretty old statute.   Antonin Scalia  How many prosecutions like this have there been?  When was the first one?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  For, you know, using the mails or interstate commerce to defraud a foreign government of taxes?   Antonin Scalia  More common, or didn't exist at all before the 19... do you know of any case before--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --before the 1980s.   Antonin Scalia  Doesn't that suggest to you that the statute isn't naturally read to cover stuff like that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We didn't have smugglers before then?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the second reason?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Well, and you have arguments against both of those two?  Which are arguments are at least... at least... arguable?  What about the third rule, the rule of lenity?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If we... if we are unsure, if it's a close question whether it's property, if it's a close question whether we're enforcing the tax laws of Canada by prosecuting somebody for violating the tax laws of Canada, if that's a closed question, why doesn't the rule of lenity apply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The restitution statute is not ambiguous at all; whereas, this statute has a number of ambiguities in it.  And if I had to find my way out of the restitution problem, I would pick the ambiguous statute to get out, rather than simply saying,  ""Well, though this restitution statute says this categorically, we will ignore it, because if we didn't ignore it, we would be enforcing the revenue laws of another country. ""  There's nothing against enforcing the revenue laws of another country, if we want to; this is just a question of statutory interpretation.  Should this ambiguous statute be interpreted that way?  If Congress said,  ""We're going to enforce Canada's tax laws. ""  there's nothing wrong with that.  But--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --So you have two statutes.  One of them seems to be quite ambiguous.  The other one is categorical, you get restitution in all cases.  Now, how do I wiggle out of it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Obviously, I wiggle out of it with the ambiguous statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you haven't told me... you haven't told me how you get out of the restitution statute.  There's no ambiguity there, and it is not a rule of law that you can't... it's unconstitutional to enforce the tax laws of Canada.  Since it's entirely feasible, and since the text is categorical, how do you get out of the restitution statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We haven't told... no, no, no, no, no, no, we're not telling Congress,  ""You can't do what you have done. ""  We're saying, ""Congress hasn't done this"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, perhaps--   Antonin Scalia  --I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  No, no problem.   Antonin Scalia  I was about to say the same... the same thing.  You keep saying there are no cases that do this.  Are there... are there... are there cases, before 1980, which do what you want to do... that is, to use our fraud law, or something, to effectively enforce Canada's... or some foreign country's tax law?

I mean, in... in a way this provision... you... you may say that the... that the substantive effect of the provision supports your interpretation, but the text of the provision supports the Government's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --because if any only means State or Federal, there was no need to say State or Federal in this provision.  You could have simply said any in this provision, just as you said it elsewhere.  So one would think that they said State or Federal because they wanted to exclude foreign antitrust matters.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't care how it got there.  I'm just saying there... there... if... if any means what you said it means, namely State or Federal, there would have been no need to limit this other provision to State or Federal because the whole statute would only cover State or Federal.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think... let... let's put, you know, the worst for you.  If it were put to Congress, which would you prefer, that... that Solzhenitsyn not be able to have a gun or that the worst kind of violent criminal convicted and imprisoned and escaped from a foreign country who manages to get into this country can go in and buy a gun?  Which... which of these two would you prefer?  And I think I'd say, well, you know, it's tough on Solzhenitsyn he can't own a gun, but he'll probably get over it.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it doesn't cover Americans, of course--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --who go... go and commit crimes abroad, are convicted abroad, and... and come back to home sweet home and then get a gun.  I mean, that seems to me extraordinary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That seems to me extraordinary.  I don't think Congress would have wanted that.   Antonin Scalia  I think if there was a problem that... that they were going to leave unsolved, it is less likely the problem of having an American citizen killed by a gun toted by somebody who has been convicted of a crime abroad than it is the problem of somebody having been convicted abroad of some silly crime like wearing a veil or not wearing a veil or something else.  If... if it's either of those two problems that they meant to leave overlooked, I would say it's the latter.  They might well have said, well, the courts will take care of that.   Antonin Scalia  Where... where is that defined?   Antonin Scalia  Once again, that... that cuts both ways.  Why would they... if the text reads the way you say it reads, why did they have to say is a misdemeanor under Federal or State law?  Because it wouldn't have mattered.  The only courts... the only convictions that would be covered would be Federal or State convictions.  They would not need that... that qualification.   Antonin Scalia  Let me... let me ask you the question the... the Chief Justice would ask, were he here, because he always asked this kind of a question.  What... if you had to pick your best case of ours which interpreted the word any in the way that you would like us to interpret here, what's... what's the best case you have?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a good question.  He asked a good question.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You call that FOPA?  That's the name of the statute?  [Laughter]  It's an unfortunate acronym, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Recidivism is an element of the crime.  If... if you have a crime of, you know, repeated felony, recidivism is an element.   INTERRUPTING ",03-750X
1,"Antonin Scalia  You can ask it as well--  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I assume that there's some prosecutorial discretion in the application of this statute?  I mean, have you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --have you prosecuted any... any woman who tried to buy a firearm because she had been convicted of wearing... not... not wearing a veil?   Antonin Scalia  Do you think any United States attorney would do that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or... or somebody who was convicted of treason in Cuba?  You... you think that... that that would be a... a case that would be prosecuted vigorously by a United States attorney?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, not too much.   Antonin Scalia  Would... would you finish... would you finish please--   Antonin Scalia  --telling us about the administrative waiver proceeding?  You were in the middle of it and I never heard the--   Antonin Scalia  --And it provides judicial review of the Attorney General's failure to give the waiver.   ",03-750X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, now, that... that definition, used or capable of being used... right, now.  After one of the hurricanes, I saw a... a tugboat that had just been washed up on shore down in the Gulf.  What if somebody... some enterprising person had fitted that out like a... like a diner, you know, a... a restaurant and they have staff in the diner and they're serving the meals off of this boat?  Now, the boat, apart from the fact that it's a couple of hundred yards inland, is capable of being... still capable of being used.  Are the employees of that diner covered by the Jones Act?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It... it goes to whether we want to use, you know, section 3 as... as our definition.   Antonin Scalia  So you say it is a vessel.  I thought your answer before was that it was not a vessel because it's not practically capable of being used.   Antonin Scalia  I... I like Justice Ginsburg's answer better.  [Laughter]  It is a vessel but it's not in navigation.  Then you could stick with the... with the section 3 definition.  It's capable of being used, so it's a vessel, but it's not--   Antonin Scalia  --Precisely?  So then the--   Antonin Scalia  --So you... you think that the person who operates the dredge, since he's not navigating the vessel, is not covered by the Jones Act?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You do not what?  Do not think he's covered by the Jones Act?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He is covered.  Well, then why isn't the croupier covered?   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't the croupier covered, you know?   Antonin Scalia  That vessel's function is gambling.  He sure is.   Antonin Scalia  What if you have a very complicated dredge and it takes two people?  One of them does nothing but... but operate the steam shovel that pulls up the goop and puts it in the... in the barges.  Okay?  And the other one moves the dredge.  You say the one is... is covered by the Jones Act and the other one isn't?  No, it can't be.  If the function of the vessel is dredging, anybody who is performing that function of dredging is covered by the Jones Act.  Don't you believe that?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, you do.  So the croupier is--  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  That's easy.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, that's not even close.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it carries all this goop somewhere else to... to dump it.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why is that reading anything in?  I mean, do... do you think if... if you were not practically capable, you would be capable?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't regard that as a reading in at all.  I mean, capable means capable.  You're either capable or not.  If you practically can't be moved, your not capable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that goes to in navigation--   Antonin Scalia  --not to whether it's a vessel or not.  It is still a vessel even if it's beached up on land so long as it is capable of... of floating.  It's just not in navigation, isn't it?   ",03-814X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Yes, but I think what the Government has said is that though it's in navigation, we have a case that says that the... that the seaman's connection to the ship has to be related to the functioning of the ship in navigation.  He doesn't have to navigate it, but he has to be working at what the ship does in the course of its navigation, and a dredge operator does that.   Antonin Scalia  Not to the navigating part but to what the vessel is doing in the course of its being in navigation.   Antonin Scalia  It happens every... every 86 years they have one of these storms.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I guess I could agree with you if... if I believed that I had to look to the primary purpose, whether the primary purpose of the vessel was transportation.  But what... what do you do about gambling ships that, you know, they... they sail out beyond the 2-mile limit and then come right back to where they left?  Now, people get on board not to get transported.  They get on board to gamble.  And the purpose of the ship, the primary purpose of the ship, is gambling.  You think that... that... the... the seamen who... who are on that ship, which regularly goes out beyond the 2-mile limit, you think that they're... that they're not covered by the Jones Act?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think it's close at all.  I think they're obviously covered by the Jones Act.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But... but that's not the primary purpose of... of the ship, just as the primary purpose of this scow is... of... of this dredge is not transportation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, a primary purpose?  Now, you're getting a little fuzzy there.  I thought you said the primary purpose.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It has to be a primary purpose.   Antonin Scalia  A Oh.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you think that's not fuzzy.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Is it... is it the vessel that's the problem?  Why... why do you focus on the vessel?  It seems to me most of your argument has gone to whether it's in navigation.  Can you be a vessel that is not in navigation?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, you can or you wouldn't have the... the combination of the two terms appearing anywhere.  So why isn't the problem here not whether it's a vessel but whether it's in navigation?   ",03-814X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Why not?  I mean, is every decision we make up for review when the interested parties fail to cite what they now assert are the dispositive acts?   Antonin Scalia  But that wouldn't have been a violation of federal law if this were not Indian country, if this were not an Oneida reservation when the transfer occurred.   Antonin Scalia  Is that the application of the Nonintercourse Act?  Because I assume it was only the federal act reservation.   Antonin Scalia  How does it read?  What does it say?  I didn't mean to interrupt you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What goes with the taxes?  You said that the other effect would be that whenever the Oneidas buy a piece of property that is within this former reservation and of which only 1 percent is now owned by Indians, whenever they buy a piece of property, that property is taken off the tax rolls.   Antonin Scalia  Which, of course, makes it a lot easier for them to buy it because it's much less expensive for them to hold that land.  What else happens?  The town can't regulate it.   Antonin Scalia  And I assume that also means that that land cannot be repurchased by non Indians?   Antonin Scalia  You're a good lawyer that they hired and the Oneidas may not have hired as good a lawyer.  I don't think this was done around the campfire, do you?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't the FBI that keeps peace on other reservations.  Isn't it quite standard for state law enforcement to function?   Antonin Scalia  Sure it can.  One way to pursue that policy is to offer them lands in the west if they want to go there.  That would certainly pursue the government's policy of removing them.   Antonin Scalia  So you're saying there is no consideration if they simply agree to remove if they want to remove.  If they chose to ignore it, they want to ignore it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They gave none, I'm talking about.   Antonin Scalia  The Indians.  You're saying they gave no promise in exchange, if they simply promised to remove if they felt like it.   Antonin Scalia  I'm trying to help you here.   ",03-855X
0,"Antonin Scalia  So you're saying your position was and is that it's not inalienable without the approval of Defense?   Antonin Scalia  But the portion within the reservation you claim is alienable so long as it's not owned by an Oneida.  Current owners can sell it to somebody else, right?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Smith, isn't there any principal of laches that comes into effect here.  I mean, what you're asking the Court to do is to sanction a very odd checkerboard system of jurisdiction in the middle of New York state.  Some parcels are the ones the Indians choose to buy and are able to buy are called Indian territory and everything else is governed by New York state, isn't it?  It's just a terrible situation as far as governance is concerned and part of the blame for the situation we're in is that the Oneidas did not claim about this for 170 years.   Antonin Scalia  The case also held that because of the passage of time and the reliance interest that has developed, we are not going to give you possession.  Now, why doesn't the same principle apply to giving you jurisdiction?  Because of the passage of time, you can get damages for trespass.  Maybe even you can even get the value of the land.  It would just create a chaotic situation if we say that you have jurisdiction in the middle of New York state over any pieces of land that you can buy.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wall, that's not the end of it.  From what you're saying, I gather that you believe, in that case, once they purchase the land, it becomes tribal.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Steward, your time is beginning to come up, and there is one thing we haven't talked about that I'd really like to get your view on, and that is the 1788 Treaty... what was that, Fort Schuyler... Treaty of Fort Schuyler?   Antonin Scalia  --between New York State and the Oneidas.  Now, that contained language which said the Oneidas cede and grant all their lands to the people of the state of New York.  That was the operative provision.  Later on, it... Article 2 says, ""Of the ceded lands""... the ceded lands, lands that have been ceded...  ""a tract described by metes and bounds is reserved to the Oneidas to hold to themselves in their posterity forever. ""  Now, I would normally interpret that too mean that the Oneidas gave up all of their sovereignty over the lands and were given back, by the State of New York, the right over this tract designated by metes and bounds.  Now, I'm saying I would normally interpret that, except in a treaty with the Indians.  In a treaty with the Indians, you say, ""Well""... and we have cases which have language somewhat like this, and they say,  ""Well, they really didn't cede the part that they reserved. ""  That may be the case in... ordinarily.  But it seems to me, a basic principle of contract law... of treaty law, of any law... that where there is an ambiguous phrase or provision, you interpret it the way the parties themselves have interpreted it.  And it seems to me that the subsequent history, after 1788, indicates that the Oneidas believed that New York State had jurisdiction over that land.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The New York State Police were in there.  New York State managed the lands.   Antonin Scalia  I don't... I don't understand that argument at all.  I mean, it's just a general rule that, where you've been wrong, you have to come forward, in a timely fashion, to get the wrong righted.  And what difference does it make what the nature of the wrong is, whether it's dispossession or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it isn't just taxes we're talking about.  It's jurisdiction over these parcels of land.  It... I mean, taxes... that's just one aspect of saying that this land no longer belongs to New York State.   ",03-855X
0,"Antonin Scalia  But this Court held only 3 years ago that the statute before us here does not permit the Attorney General to hold the alien indefinitely.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But this statute just... just goes in a circle because it ends.  The way end... (A) ends is that after revoking the parole, the alien shall forthwith return or be returned to the custody from which he was paroled and thereafter his case shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant for admission to the United States, which refers you back to... to 1231(a)(6).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, this shall continue to be dealt with in the same manner as that of any other applicant--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Dealt with includes, it seems to me, 1231(a)(6).   Antonin Scalia  By which you mean... parole statute, by which you mean?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  That's an interpretation.   Antonin Scalia  It says... that's an interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It says the statute does not confer power to hold beyond a reasonable period.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kneedler--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Kneedler, may I... may I try to get in the question I did earlier?  Is... is 8 U.S.C., section 1182(d)(5)... was... was that applicable in Zadvydas, as it's applicable here?   Antonin Scalia  So this is a new string to your bow in this case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But this... this regime is not sending, you know, an armed flotilla to Florida.  They just--  [Laughter]  --they just open their jails and say, hey, you know, go wherever you want.  And these people say I want to get out of here, and they go to Florida.  You... you want us--   John S. Mills  That was less than 1 percent--   Antonin Scalia  --to bomb Cuba because of that.   John S. Mills  --That was less than 1 percent of the Cubans who came in the Mariel boatlift.  That did occur, and we do have options for dealing with them.  We can return them forcibly.  If they don't allow us, that's like them sending a missile.  It's... we... we can destroy the missile.  We can't destroy a human being.  By punishing a human being that Castro sends over, we're not sending a message to Castro.  We're not saying, ah, you sent your prisoners over here and were going to indefinitely detain them.  Mental torture.  That will teach you.  That's--   Antonin Scalia  It might have been a... a means of warning Congress off one area, but not the other.  That is to say, just because we think there's a constitutional doubt here and therefore Congress might be sailing close to the wind if they tried to overrule our opinion by statute doesn't mean that Congress couldn't in this other area alter the result in Zadvydas.   John S. Mills  I think that that is absolutely a... a conclusion that can be drawn that Congress--   Antonin Scalia  Of course, I dissented in that case.  So I'm not saying this was a good idea.  [Laughter]   ",03-878X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Before you get to that, do you think that that's the only statute applicable here?  What about 1182(d)(5)?  What's your response to the Government's assertion that that's an independent basis?   Antonin Scalia  And there's no... and... and there's no answer to Justice Souter's question with regard to people who... who... once they enter that way.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Except a new statute.   Antonin Scalia  Just normal, harmless criminals.   Antonin Scalia  Right?  [Laughter]   ",03-878X
1,"Antonin Scalia  That's of annual income.  Right?  2 percent of... of the person's annual income?   Antonin Scalia  For the year.   Antonin Scalia  But, gee, in the case of a... of a major award, that 2 percent is very likely to be exceeded, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  So this is a problem that's going to exist even... even after the alternate minimum tax is abolished.  Right?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you don't think... the Government doesn't think it's a problem.  I'm talking about taking a huge percentage of the... of the person's recovery.  That... that will happen even... even in the case where there's no minimum tax... alternative.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose... suppose the same amount were paid, as was paid here, to the attorney, but it was not by way of a contingent fee, that the... the client had committed to pay this dollar amount in a dollar amount.   Antonin Scalia  As a flat fee.  What... what would the tax treatment of that be?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you... you don't need a transfer of the... I don't understand what you mean--   Antonin Scalia  --a transfer of the... the cause of action.  Certainly if you buy a piece of real estate and... and there's lawyer's business connected with it, you... you don't... you don't take an ordinary deduction which is subject to the alternative minimum tax for those lawyer's fees.  You just say that's part of the transaction, and it goes onto the basis of your property.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't... why isn't that very similar to this?  I mean, what difference does it make whether there's a... there's a transaction here, isn't there?  Isn't there a transaction?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but a... the service is connected to a transaction, namely the conversion of the chosen action into a money payment.  You have this--   Antonin Scalia  --this unformed chosen action.  You're entitled to it, but there's a transaction converting it into a money payment.  Now, why shouldn't you attribute to that transaction all... which is profitable to you, all of the costs that go along with the transaction?   Antonin Scalia  That is a problem that occurs to me.  I don't know where you draw the line.  And you say you can't draw a line.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're... you're--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I... can I ask you a question relating to the Davenport... what's been referred to as the Davenport theory?  I had thought that... that the service has used the... the transaction theory with regard to legal fees payable for a lawsuit seeking increased compensation for the condemnation of real estate where the taxpayer had objected to the amount that the condemning entity was offering and brought suit in court and with a contingent fee to the lawyer and that the service treated that as... as part of the transaction cost.  Am I wrong about that?   Antonin Scalia  Maybe my recollection is wrong.  I'll look again.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Salmons, I... I... you've cited the... the Baylin case to me and I... I've looked at the description of it in the brief, which I had recalled, and what it says is that it did, indeed, involve a taking by the State, and when the State didn't offer what Baylin thought was... was enough, he went to court, he prevailed, and recovered a much larger sum than the State had offered him.  His legal fees were, by the IRS, subtracted from the award, and he was taxed only upon the proceeds reduced by the legal fees.  Now, how do you explain that situation there?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And how does that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I doubt... I doubt whether Professor Davenport has misdescribed the case in... in his brief, but I--   Antonin Scalia  --We don't really know who prepared that colloquy anyway, do we?   Antonin Scalia  It might have been prepared by the respondents here.   ",03-892X
0,"Antonin Scalia  It's a partnership theory when you talk about two persons joining together.  I don't like this... this gold mine view of litigation, that it's, you know, like two prospectors.  You know, there's money to be obtained.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's... that's not what I view of a chosen action as.  I view it as a legal right--   Antonin Scalia  --that the person is entitled to money, and ultimately the amount he's entitled to is determined by the litigation.  And I'm not about to adopt a... a legal theory that... that views this as a... as a search for buried treasure--  [Laughter]  --in... in which the... the lawyer and the person who has been wronged are... are simply co-prospectors.  I... I just think that that's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Maybe that's how you view the... the enterprise--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but I don't think the law does.   Antonin Scalia  There was no avoidance motive in the--   Antonin Scalia  --granddaddy of all cases.  The assignment there, although it was between family members, had been made before there was an income tax.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The income tax didn't exist.  There... there couldn't conceivably have been an avoidance motive.  So... so our holding could hardly be based upon... upon the existence of an avoidance motive.   Antonin Scalia  What is different?   Antonin Scalia  What is different?   Antonin Scalia  The who?   Antonin Scalia  The Oregon question.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is the Oregon question?   Antonin Scalia  I'm sure it's not his theory.  He... he thinks it's... it's attached to transactions, and... and much of his argument is devoted to showing that capital transactions are no different from other transactions as far as the Internal Revenue Code's desire to match the... the gain with the expenses concerned.  And that's the part of his theory that I'm not so sure about because aside from the... aside from the condemnation case that I mentioned, I... I don't know of any other cases in which the Internal Revenue Service has treated transaction costs the way he would have it done.  Maybe it makes sense, but I--   Antonin Scalia  No, it didn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It... it originated in a case where there could not possibly have been an... an intent to abuse because the... the transfer had occurred before there was any income tax.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, just... just don't... maybe you think that that's what it ought to be, but... but please don't tell us that that is how it originated.  It plainly did not originate that way.   Antonin Scalia  That's a different argument.  I'm... I'm just quarreling over whether it originated that way.

From cases we've had here, we know that they're used in places like bus depots to... to sniff luggage that... that passengers have carried through on... on buses.   Antonin Scalia  And the republic seems to have survived.   Antonin Scalia  No.  These aren't sniffs for... for explosives.  These are sniffs for drugs and... and these... these are not buses that are coming in from France.  They're coming in from one American city to another.  And... and there's no more need in... in that case than there was in this case.  It was just a good... a good place to find criminals who were carrying unlawful drugs.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Inadvertently.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Not necessarily.   Antonin Scalia  I think you should use it.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Why... why do you... are you sure that Kyllo, you know, the... the imaging case, would have come out the same way if the only thing... the only thing... that the imaging could pick out is not any of the other private activities in the home, but the only thing it could possibly discern is a dead body with a knife through the heart?  Are you sure the case would have come out the same way?  I'm not at all sure.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or if that happened a large percentage of the time.  I mean, surely you'd concede that the search is unreasonable if, for every... every one time, you... you make somebody open his bag because the dog actually smells narcotics, 99 times you make somebody open his bag because he has apples in it.  I mean, wouldn't that go to the reasonableness of--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  A nice turn of phrase, as I recall.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Wasn't there... didn't Kyllo... wasn't what... what the Court was worried about in Kyllo not just the relatively crude heat imaging that existed in the case before it, but the prospect of more and more sophisticated heat imaging which... which we had evidence was already in development that would enable you to see people moving around a room?  I thought the case referred to that.  Now, are we going to have more and more... what's going to happen with dogs?  I... I can't imagine that... that this thing is going anywhere other than smelling narcotics and smelling bombs.   Antonin Scalia  Do you agree with... with General Madigan that it doesn't make any difference whether the... the dog is a... is a mechanical instrument or not?  Do you agree it makes no difference?  I thought that one of the... one of the points in... in the imaging case was that this was a new technology which didn't exist and that although the ordinary rules in 1791 was that there was no search unless... you know, unless you enter the house or unless you... you physically intrude upon the person's... at least the person's clothes, we made an exception to that rule because of this new technology that enabled you to find out things without having to intrude into the home or into the person.  Now, but... but this is not a new technology.  This is a dog and... and they had that ability in 1791 just as they had it today.  And the rule that when there's no intrusion, there's no search... there's no reason to depart from that rule with respect to a dog although there would be with respect to some sophisticated new technology that would enable you to find out all sorts of things.   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me you shouldn't... you shouldn't assume that... that the fact that this is a canine makes no difference.   Antonin Scalia  You don't know that, do you?   Antonin Scalia  But that didn't go to whether it was a search or seizure.  I think it goes to whether it was an unreasonable search or seizure.  Don't you think so?  That what... what might be unreasonable with respect to a home would not be unreasonable with respect to a suitcase?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, we could separate the home from the... from what happened here and still validate the search here if we held that it was a search, but was a reasonable one since all you find is that the person was carrying contraband.  It's the only thing that's disclosed.  Whereas, if you... if you did the same thing with... with regard to a house, which is a more sacrosanct part of one's privacy, it might be an unreasonable search.  We... we could reach that result if we wanted to, couldn't we?   INTERRUPTING ",03-923X

I'm a policeman and... and I'm looking out for, I don't know, people with a nervous tic because I think that that might be somebody who's about to commit a crime or has committed a crime.  Have I searched that person because I... I observe something external?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there no difference between an investigation and a search?   Antonin Scalia  No.  It seems to me your brief and... and your statement here both seem to assume that there's a search whenever the police investigate.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's not so.  They... one can investigate without searching.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose a policeman follows me around.  He just... just follows me around, observing with his... with plain eyes.  Now, is that a search?  Does he need probable cause to do that?  Now, he's wasting his time and he's wasting public money and maybe he should get fired for doing it, if he has no reason to follow me.   Antonin Scalia  And maybe... maybe I'd have a harassment action against him if he does it, you know, blatantly.  But is that a search?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So... so the mere fact that one is in investigating something doesn't make it a search.  What does make it a search?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The fact that you find out something?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think it would be better if he hadn't been stopped?  If... if they just... just randomly walked up to somebody who was going through a toll booth and had the dog sniff the car, you think that would be a better case--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --for allowing it than... than yours?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He does that.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, in this case.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Would it be bad?  Would it be bad if that's what he did?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Meczyk, I assume that your answer to whether it's lawful to have a... a dog at a bus depot just to sniff the bags of people who were coming off, without stopping them, but just... just to have the dogs there, that's unlawful.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  That's... that's what I think you should say.   ",03-923X
1,"Antonin Scalia  There was also an objection to introduction of... of photographs that... that were inflammatory, wasn't there?   Antonin Scalia  Those photographs would have infected the... the penalty phase, as well as the guilt phase.  So it was important for him to object to them.   Antonin Scalia  In the guilt phase.   Antonin Scalia  The other side says that guilt is not as... not as clear as you... as you make it out.  Is... is that... is that issue even before us here?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it isn't a matter of whether it's before it.  I... I just wonder whether it goes to... to the issue here, whether you needed to get his assent or not.  It... it probably goes to the quite separate question of whether there was inadequate performance by counsel.  No?  Is that question before us also?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was... was the latter question ruled upon below?   Antonin Scalia  And never... and never reached the... the inadequate performance of counsel question.   Antonin Scalia  What... what about the courts below the Florida Supreme Court?  Didn't they rule on it?   Antonin Scalia  Do we have any cases involving what... what you describe as tacit consent?   Antonin Scalia  In... in terms of... of pleading guilty.  Do we have any cases in which a similar thing happened, that the counsel said I'm going to plead you guilty and the... the defendant doesn't say anything, just passively sits there as though, you know?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But even apart from the competence of the lawyer, whether it shows adequate performance by the lawyer, can't you... can't you divide the Boykin rule, which doesn't relate to the lawyer's competence at all, into three different categories: number one, where there is express consent which is... makes it okay; number two, when there's no consent at all, which is bad; and number three, where there is what... what you call here implicit consent?  Aren't there really three different situations?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I... I assume... I assume your response is that if you eliminate from the Boykin rule the possibility of implicit consent, you are forcing the lawyer who believes he has the consent of... of a... an intractable client such as this fellow who... who didn't go into the courtroom, took all his clothes off so they couldn't take him into the courtroom.  He was obviously not... didn't want to be responsive.  Your... you would have forced this lawyer to adopt a strategy which the lower court found would have been damaging to this defendant, even though the lawyer believes that the defendant really approved of the strategy that the lawyer was undertaking.  Why would we want to adopt a rule like that?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, if it were a matter of Florida law, the Florida legislature could change it.   Antonin Scalia  If it's a matter of Federal law, it can't.   Antonin Scalia  Are you going to get to the point of whether there was, indeed, an opportunity for this defendant to introduce evidence about inadequate performance of counsel?   INTERRUPTING ",03-931X
0,"Antonin Scalia  But he--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't agree with your earlier statement that what... what this defendant expected was a contested trial in which, you know, the State's evidence is challenged, blah, blah, blah.  That's to the contrary.  He said this whole thing is... is just a big railroad job and that's one reason I don't want to be there.  Go ahead and do whatever you want.  He wasn't... he wasn't expecting... in fact, if you're... if you're talking about is subjective expectations, they would reinforce the lawyer's belief that he had no objection to conceding guilt because he was referring to this as... as one big railroad job.   Antonin Scalia  I thought he had made those statements about being railroaded before he found out about the lawyer's concession.   Antonin Scalia  I think that's correct.   Antonin Scalia  And there's no difference between a capital case and a regular case insofar as the intelligence of that strategy is concerned because even when there is not a separate penalty phase, it is sometimes in the interest of the defendant to, in effect, throw himself on the mercy of the sentencer, whether that is the jury or the judge, by... by not contesting the... the fact that... that he did the acts charged.  That... that occurs not just in capital case but in... in regular cases.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that... but that's not a problem.  According to the lower courts, that was a good strategy.  I don't know why you want counsel, when... when the client doesn't answer, to say, gee, I... you know, I don't know whether he has approved or disapproved, I'm going to have to take the course that will probably get him executed because I... I haven't received an answer.  Why would you force that course on the... on the lawyer?  If the lawyer believes that the silence implies consent, as... as silence usually does, why not let the lawyer do what's in the client's best interest?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And Nixon... okay.  You have the inquiry and Nixon just stands there, the same, doesn't say a thing, assuming you could get him into the courtroom, you know, assuming he had put his clothes on so you could bring him into the courtroom.  He just... he just sits there.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and you say, well, since we don't have an answer, we have to take the course that's going to get this guy executed.  That doesn't seem to me to make much sense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Hadn't there been a hearing on those issues on the way up?   Antonin Scalia  No?   Antonin Scalia  Wasn't--   Antonin Scalia  --No.  We're talking below.   Antonin Scalia  We're talking below on the way up to the Florida Supreme Court.  I assume that... that he raised below the issue of inadequate performance of counsel and he had his opportunity to introduce whatever evidence he had on that subject on the way up to the Florida Supreme Court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't know why the Florida Supreme Court should be obliged to remand it in order to give him a second bite at the apple.   ",03-931X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, it doesn't depend on... on what you... what you consider to be the value of the stock.  Until the disclosure of the fact that they didn't find gold is made, the stock is still worth $60, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Because everybody else thinks they found gold too.  So you're still holding stock worth $60, if worth means its market value.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  And we're dealing with a special rule that looks to market value.  Right?  You don't have to have the... the representation made explicitly to the plaintiff.  It's a representation that was made to the market at large which caused the market value of the stock.   Antonin Scalia  So he paid $60, he got $60.  There's no loss.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't matter in this case, does it?  Is... is that issue before us?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do we have to decide that issue here?   Antonin Scalia  And is it... is it easy to prove that... that the price of this now valuable stock because they found platinum would have been $40 higher had they found gold?  I mean, the burden would be on the plaintiff to prove that... would... I mean, if we adopted that theory.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It would be very hard to prove, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  I think they'd be called reliance damages.  You know, I used to teach contract law.  We would call it reliance damages.   Antonin Scalia  Well, they... they wouldn't have to prove how it came out.  They would just have to prove that the market knew the truth, no matter how the market learned the truth.  I mean, if it was published in a... in a column by some market reporter who doesn't disclose how he found out.  So long as the market knows the truth, isn't that all they need?   Antonin Scalia  In any event, the difference between getting the... the complaint dismissed on the pleadings or having to wait for a... a 12(b)(6) motion because as soon as you, you know, ask for the... the proof of the elements of the cause of action, you're entitled to have, if... if your analysis of the case is correct, you're entitled to have the drop in... in the value of the stock shown.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they paid... they paid whether it was a market price or not.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, what they paid happens to be the market price, but... but you can't really say that the Ninth Circuit was referring to the market price as part of its... its damages.  Its damages are what they paid.  Whether that... if they paid above market, it would be the same.   ",03-932X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Why?  I don't understand.  I mean, there would be even more expectation taken out after the fraud is announced.  I mean, it's just like saying, you know, besides... besides fact that our CEO just died, there's no gold there.  Don't you think it would go down still further?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How can you reconcile that with your concession that if the person who... who buys it at an inflated price turns around 2 days later and sells it at that same inflated price, he cannot bring suit?  You would not allow recovery in that situation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How... how can you reconcile that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --with the notion that the loss occurred at the time your purchased?   Antonin Scalia  They're saying there's no losses.  I mean, that's... it's inconsistent how the losses come out.  You just told us the loss occurs, bang, when you buy it.  You've gotten stock that really isn't worth what you paid for it, the notion of... of worth as some... you know, some objective thing rather than what... what people are willing to pay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's your theory and it seems to me you're stuck with it.  And if that theory is true, then it shouldn't matter that you later sell it to some other poor, unsuspecting individual for the same amount you bought it for.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have to show what before recovery?  You have to show?   Antonin Scalia  That's what they're saying.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  To me your... your--   Antonin Scalia  --And that's worrying me too.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  I think... I think you're... I think you're agreeing with the petitioners.  I think this... this whole thing is a great misunderstanding.  You... you didn't--  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  It cited... I thought cited Knapp and... which, in turn, cited Gray or... or--   Antonin Scalia  --I mean, if you're worried about it, why aren't you worried about it later, as well as earlier?  I mean, if that's going to be a problem, we should know it sooner rather than later, rather than... you know.  If you say that's terribly difficult to prove, we can hardly ever prove it, well, good.  Then let's get rid of this... rid of the case earlier.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't... I don't know why... why it's desirable not to include that at the pleading stage.   Antonin Scalia  So... so... I'm not sure I understand what... I'm... I'm really coming to believe that this is a misunderstanding.  It seems to me you're now saying that the loss does not occur when you make the purchase.  It is just that that is the limit on your loss, the difference between what the stock would have cost you had the... the absence of gold been known and what you actually paid.   Antonin Scalia  But that is not your loss.  You're saying now the loss has to occur later when the price goes down and you're thereby harmed.  Is that it?   Antonin Scalia  You don't know about it, but the market knows about it.  That's... that's why the stock has gone down.   ",03-932X
0,"Antonin Scalia  And you say we found no serious Sixth Amendment issue raised.  Was the right of jury trial issue argued in that case, and decided?   Antonin Scalia  The right to jury trial is fairly clear and stark, and I guess don't recall that being argued in any of those cases.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Clement, here's the problem I have with the Government's argument insofar as it does not urge that we reverse Blakely, I know that you want us to do that as well.  But assuming we adhere to Blakely, it seems to me you have a cure that doesn't correspond to the disease.  You say that the reason the right to jury trial does not apply here is because, after all, these sentences have not been prescribed, or these maximums have not been prescribed by the legislature, but rather, have been prescribed by a quasi-judicial agency.  But the right of jury trial is meant to protect against whom?  Who are you worried about when you say,  ""I want to be tried by a jury. ""  You're not worried about the legislature, you're worried about the judges, precisely.  So I don't care if the upper level of the Guidelines were actually prescribed by a court, as opposed to the Commission which is, I don't know what it is, but it's not a court.  But even if it were prescribed by a court, how would that eliminate the jury trial problem?  The whole reason for jury trial is we don't trust judges.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but we're talking here about one precise role of the judge or of the jury, and that is, to find a fact that is necessary to keep you in jail for an additional number of years.  And the difference with discretionary sentencing is if it's, you know, ten to twenty years, what you know when you do the crime is that you've laid yourself open to twenty years.  Now, if you get a merciful judge, good for you, I mean, that's lagniappe as they say in Louisiana, but if you get a hanging judge, you've got twenty years, and you know that when you commit the crime, whereas we have a system now where you entitled to no more than so much.  And I find it just incompatible with a jury trial right to say that that fact must be determined, before you can be kept in jail.  And yet we're going let it be determined by a judge.  That bears no resemblance to the discretionary sentencing system.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not the maximum exposure.  If, for example, one of the factors is whether the crime was committed with a firearm, I know that if I don't use a firearm, under the Guidelines, I can only get so many years, so somebody has to find that I used a firearm, and if I didn't, my maximum exposure is less.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And each one is appealable separately, each one is appealable separately, it's a separate legal finding.  And the judge doesn't, in discretionary sentencing, he doesn't have to make any factual finding, he can just look at you and say,  ""I think you're a bad actor, you've got forty years. ""  We have a system here where the judge must make factual findings, and each one is appealable if he's made them incorrectly.   Antonin Scalia  I find very little difference between telling him to evaluate it with regard to particular elements of a crime and asking him to evaluate it with regard to particular sentencing facts.  The result is the same.  You're asking him to evaluate it in the light of certain facts that he has to find.  Whether you call them the one or the other, he's doing the same thing.  If he finds this fact you get three more years; if he doesn't find it, you don't.  I mean, you know, as far as the real outcome is concerned, what difference does it make whether you call it an ""element"" or a ""required fact for sentencing""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's still in the judicial branch, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, as to past.  I mean, it may have a significant one-shot impact with respect to cases that were decided without Blakely in mind.  But for the future, I, I just don't agree with you that changes could make some reduction.  I think changes could provide for jury findings whenever, whenever there's a need for a higher sentence based on facts.  I don't know; what is the problem with that?   Antonin Scalia  What text do you have to take out?   Antonin Scalia  It depends on what you mean by the ""court"", doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Which... which is sometimes done, there are statutes that refer to the court, that--   Antonin Scalia  --It seems to me, when there is an ambiguity that construed one way creates a constitutional statute and construed another way creates an unconstitutional one, it's an easy call.   Antonin Scalia  And if it can't be, maybe the judges shouldn't go, be going around guessing how many people have been defrauded.  Or you know, saying  ""more likely than not, on the basis of the kind of evidence we usually don't accept in criminal trials. ""  Why is that okay?  I don't understand it.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't make me feel any good if I spend another years in jail because of it.  Say,  ""Oh, well, don't worry about it, it wasn't an element of the crime, after all. ""  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Could it be that ""shall"" does not mean ""may""?  Right?  [Laughter]  Oh, that's not it?  ""Shall""--   Antonin Scalia  --Absolutely.  Vote me for that.  I mean, after all, judges used to define the elements of crimes, didn't they?  And the mere fact that the elements at common law were defined by judges rather than by the legislature didn't mean that you didn't have to have a jury find them.  So if courts are going to establish the guidelines, so long as they are still binding, it seems to me you still need a jury finding, or you haven't escaped Apprendi.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Judicial discretionary sentencing, as I understood it, never permitted an appellate court to increase the sentence given by the district judge.  Do you know of any cases, where an appellate court said the district judge did not give enough years, where there was discretionary sentencing?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that may be under statute, but I do not know, at common law, that when you talked about the discretion in the courts, it meant that in a criminal case a court of appeals could increase the sentence because of a... because of an abuse of discretion by the sentencing judge.  I'm unfamiliar with any such case.   Antonin Scalia  Except that that, as Justice O'Connor suggests, deprives the statute of its principal purpose, which was to constrain... to constrain judicial discretion.  If there's anything clear about it, that was clear about, it was that they did not want judges to have as much discretion as they had.  And now you say these things are just advisory.  It seems to me much easier to... I wanted to ask you one very precise question.  Assuming I think ""court"" can mean ""jury""... it doesn't have to mean ""the judge""... where in, in the whole guideline system, how many sections do not permit the use of ""court"" to mean ""jury""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think there's only one where, where it may not work.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That... that may be the one.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.

Antonin Scalia  Why do you assume that it... that it is the reasonable expectation of two people who have... who are living together in... on... in common premises, that, where one of them wants somebody to come in, and the other one does not want somebody to come in, the person may come in?  I would think that the normal assumption is just the opposite, that, where one wants somebody excluded, that person will be excluded.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --In Matlock--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --In Matlock--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --In Matlock, did the... did the absent person say no?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you don't even have, in Matlock, a situation where you know that one of the parties didn't want entry.  You don't know that.  You... there was one party there, and that party said, ""Okay, come in"".  And the other party said,  ""Well, if I had been consulted, I would have said no. ""  or whatever.  But--   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dreeben, does this authority to let someone in, over the objection of the cohabitant, apply only to policemen, or is it... is it also the case that...

I would have thought the opposite.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All she said is, ""He's a cocaine user"".

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's why we came out the other way in Smith, by the way.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But--   Antonin Scalia  --RFRA overrides all that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand RFRA to be... to say there can be an exception to all Federal statutes where someone makes a religious objection to compliance and, in the judgment of the court, there's not a compelling State interest in the Government going ahead with the statute.  So, you know, whatever the scheme was under the drug laws, it seems to me it's subject to this new legislation.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Horton, what, what difference does it make that, that New London was in an economic depression?  Would it not be fully as much, under your theory of a public use, for a city to say, yes, we are not doing badly, but we could do better.  Let's attract some high tech industry here.  You can't possibly draw a line between depressed cities and undepressed cities, can you?   Antonin Scalia  You wouldn't.  And you wouldn't ask us to do it either.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Any city can do it.  And in the hypothetical that Justice Souter gave earlier where, you know, you couldn't take it from A and give it to B, because B is a good Democrat, you could take it from A and give it to B if B is richer, and would pay higher municipal taxes, couldn't you?   Antonin Scalia  No.  I just want to take property from people who are paying less taxes and give it to people who are paying more taxes.  That would be a public use, wouldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Let me qualify it.  You can take from A to give to B if B pays more taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'll accept that.  You can take from A and give to B if B pays significantly more taxes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You accept that as a proposition?   Antonin Scalia  Is that a factual finding?  You consider that a factual finding?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that this is primarily for the benefit of the city of New London, not for the benefit of a--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --In the eye of the beholder, to whom do you think this does greater benefit to, not a factual finding.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Horton, you're paying for it, but you're also taking property from somebody who doesn't want to sell it.  Does that count for nothing?  Yes, you're paying for it, but you're giving the money to somebody who doesn't want the money, who wants to live in the house that she's lived in her whole life.  That counts for nothing?   Antonin Scalia  Well, then, let me ask... would, would the reasonableness standard, if the project is indeed reasonable, and there is genuine prospect that all of these good things that you're talking about will happen, why wouldn't private money come in to further the project?  Why is it necessary to condemn it if it's so reasonable.  Why couldn't you, you... now, you say there is a holdout for one part, parcel.  Couldn't the city fund a private purchase of that parcel?  Say, you know, we'll make funds available out of our general tax revenue to somebody who wants to come in and put together this system?  Of course, that person has to buy out property owners, but we'll, we'll give you money to buy them out at high prices.   Antonin Scalia  Common carriers are subject to state regulation to a degree that private companies are not.  They must, they must treat all comers alike.  I mean, I don't think the public utility cases are at all comparable to condemning land in order to get a new company to move in and pay more taxes.  I just don't think it's similar.   Antonin Scalia  I agree with you on that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that would really overrule a bunch of prior cases and really throw condemnation law into chaos.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you know, in any case--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --What this lady wants is not more money.  No amount of money is going to satisfy her.  She is living in this house, you know, her whole life and she does not want to move.  She said I'll move if it's being taken for a public use, but by God, you're just giving it to some other private individual because that individual is going to pay more taxes.  I... it seems to me that's, that's an objection in principle, and an objection in principle that the public use requirement of the Constitution seems to be addressed to.   Antonin Scalia  It wouldn't the first of Holmes' decisions to be overruled.   ",04-108X
1,"Antonin Scalia  We're not bound by that concession.  If that's a jurisdictional question, it doesn't matter whether the Government conceded it or not, does it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a different question.   Antonin Scalia  I still think it's whether because I don't agree with the Government.  Can I do that?   Antonin Scalia  So that is the question.  I mean, the question is open whether there--   Antonin Scalia  --But our cases say that where we don't speak to a jurisdictional question, it is not regarded as having been decided.   Antonin Scalia  Even... even if you assume that Von Raab decided it, you have a quite different situation here.  The issue isn't whether there will be any judicial review.  The issue is whether there will be judicial review for the minor grievances, even if they happen to involve a constitutional issue, that are... that are not... for which judicial review was not provided.  Any major employee action... judicial review, as I understand it, is available, and it is only relatively insignificant actions for which judicial review is not available.  Isn't that right?   Antonin Scalia  He could have refused... he could have refused the search, in which case if there was any significant personnel action taken against him for refusing it, he would have had judicial review of whether the search was constitutional or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's often the case where... where, in... in order to challenge a governmental action, you... you have to be willing to... to go to court by resisting it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that search was a consequence of his employment.  It... this wasn't a search of a... of a citizen who had no connection with the Government.  It was a search that he was required to submit to as an employee.  So to... to describe it as unrelated to employee actions seems to me unrealistic.  The only reason he submitted to it was that if he didn't, he would have... he would have been subject to an employee action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ms.... Ms. Karlan, if this is indeed serious, are you sure that it's not a personnel action?   Antonin Scalia  There is a residual category in the definition of personnel action which says, any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.  That's the residual category.  But one of the specifically named categories, before you get to that, is a decision to order psychiatric testing.  Now, if that kind of a decision could be a personnel action, why couldn't a decision to conduct... to conduct a drug test be considered a personnel action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not adding it.  There's a residual category at the end or any other significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.  I consider this... you consider it a significant change in working conditions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And he thought he didn't have to undergo drug testing, and what do you know?  He's being picked on for drug testing all the time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why then would a decision to order psychiatric testing qualify?  Because it says, or any other.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Significant change in duties, responsibilities, or working conditions.  The implication is that a decision to order psychiatric testing is a significant change in duties, responsibilities, or... or working conditions.   Antonin Scalia  It's always good to be safe.   Antonin Scalia  And you... you agree with the Government on that, that he can never get review of the statutory claim.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, well.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Stewart, you know, you have here a statute in which Congress, with malice aforethought, very clearly provides for judicial review of any major personnel actions and does not provide for judicial review of what it had regarded as insignificant personnel actions.  I can understand the position, although I don't agree with it, that the constitutional provision which says Congress can... can make exceptions to the jurisdiction of the Federal courts should not be interpreted to exclude significant constitutional claims.  But when Congress has gone to the trouble of providing for judicial review of any claims that are significant and just saying any other insignificant action, even though a constitutional violation is alleged in connection with it, if in fact it does not harm you that much, we're not going to allow judicial review, what is... what is wrong with that?  It seems to me that's what Congress has said and... and you're creating a scheme that simply contradicts what Congress plainly said.   Antonin Scalia  Did any of them involve a situation in which Congress took the pain to separate significant actions from insignificant actions?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, some of them involve deportation and, you know, major... major actions.  This is a case where Congress has... has carefully tried to say these are major actions for which you should be able to get into the courts.  And these other things... you... you have these administrative remedies, but that's the end of it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the second statute?  There's no second statute here.  There... there is your concession of the fact that there has to be judicial review.  That's what's driving all of this.  And... and generally speaking, when we find something to be unconstitutional, we don't rewrite a statute so that it will be constitutional.  We just say, you know, there has to be judicial review.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Stewart, if... if we're going to tweak the statute, isn't the least possible tweak... and perhaps not a tweak at all... simply to consider this a personnel action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If... if a decision to order psychiatric testing can be one, why can't a decision to require drug testing be one?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure it's a tweak at all.  It... it just depends on... on what you consider to be working conditions.

It says,  ""An order remanding the case may require payment of just cause... just costs and any actual expenses, including attorneys fees. ""  Especially the ""just costs"", that's a standard.

So, you're receiving what other employers in the same situation would receive.   Antonin Scalia  No, but it seems me you've got us off galloping in the wrong direction.  The statute doesn't require simply giving the same access that you give to other employers.  It requires much more than that.  It requires that they... it prohibits, or cuts off, funds if an institution either prohibits or, in effect, prevents the Secretary of a military department from gaining access to campuses for purposes of military recruiting in a manner that is at least equal in quality and scope to the access to campuses and to students that is provided to any other employer.  So, it seems to me that the statute demands more than simply you give the same access as all other employers.  If you allow any other employer, you have to give it to the military in the same manner.   Antonin Scalia  What does Title X of the United States Code deal with?

I think we need to go there, at least... it seems strange to me that you have two different words and if, indeed, established means the same thing that you're telling us located means, I'm not going to agree with you.  I mean, they're... they're two different words--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, there I think the Fourth Circuit said we... we had a case that resolved that.   Antonin Scalia  I think the Fourth Circuit said that we had a case that... that answered that question, not a case involving this particular provision--   Antonin Scalia  --but a case involving another provision of... of the banking laws.   Antonin Scalia  And you think a lawyer has to go back, in order to advise a client, and... and when he has a word... two words in... in a provision... one, established; the other, located... he has to go back and figure out every one of these reenactments and inquire into, you know, what Congress meant at the time?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He... he has... he has a statute that says established in one part, located in another, and he has a Supreme Court case, which I mentioned, but you apparently disregard, which is Bougas, which--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, which... when I asked about it, you... you drew a blank.  I mean, that's the case I was referring to.  And in... which had a similar provision using the word established and located and said that established meant one thing and said what in this case it meant.  Now, it was for a different purpose, to be sure, but if I were a lawyer looking up... and it... you know, it dealt with banks.  And if... if I were a... a lawyer, I would have... I would have said, gee, there it is.  The Supreme Court--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --says where you have established and located in... in the same provision, located means where they have a branch.

And... and that seems to me a very persuasive indication for a lawyer--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --who's trying to figure out how to advise his client.   Antonin Scalia  What did the Government argue in Bougas?  I... I didn't look up the briefs in the case.  Did the Government appear in... in that case?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you're--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --But the money--   Antonin Scalia  --is not coming from the Nation, it's coming from the State of Georgia.  Was the State of Georgia guilty of constitutional violations?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no, my--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I mean a record... a record that would have justified applying, against the State of Georgia, prophylactic measures.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even against people who played no part in that nationwide record.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But was that before or after the enactment of this statute?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I'm looking at the--   Antonin Scalia  --at the chart in one of the amicus briefs, which shows that there are, for Georgia... and it lists all the States... for Georgia, zero arguable State violations prior to the Act.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well--   Antonin Scalia  --State and local violations.   Antonin Scalia  But State and local units don't enjoy the sovereign immunity of the State.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --don't need this Act to sue them.   Antonin Scalia  Why don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Why don't you need it for 1983 violations?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Constitutional violations.  Not just prophylaxis--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but actual constitutional violations by the prisons under 1983--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that don't happen to relate to the handicapped and, thus, are not covered by this legislation.  You can't get damages there.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait, but... you know, in 1983, when you exhaust your prison remedies, the prison fixes what was wrong, and that's the end of it.  But, under this Act, you go through your prison remedies, what do you ask the prison for?  Money?  The prison can't give you money, so they say,  ""No, you can't get your money. ""  I--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --mean, the prison-remedy thing is... the only thing it does is make it take a longer time to get to court, but it does the prison no good.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We could say that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in this opinion.  I mean, that would make it happen, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Castanias, suppose the Court agrees with you that the response here is not proportionate, and, hence, that the prophylactic aspects of this statute are invalid.  There remains the fact that the statute covers actual constitutional violations for which you don't need any special proportionality.  Certainly, the Government can allow the States to be sued for constitutional violations.  And the plaintiff here claims that some of the acts he's seeking damages for do amount to constitutional violations.  How can we possibly say that that suit does not lie?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't lie damages here.  Can you get damages under 1983?   Antonin Scalia  Against the State?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  State officers don't have any money.

I'm not going to read it unrealistically so that it only includes constitutional violations.  But, to the extent that it includes constitutional violations, why isn't that lawsuit perfectly okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that just proves that they went too far.  It doesn't prove that, to the extent that it covers a constitutional violation, it's okay.

The judgment is reversed.  And if there were issues that should have been resolved in order to reverse the judgment, and that weren't, it would seem to me that your remedy would not be to say to the Court of Appeals,  ""Well, the Supreme Court didn't mean what it said. ""  or,  ""didn't know what it was doing. ""  but, rather, to move for reconsideration here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are you saying you couldn't... you couldn't file a motion for rehearing on the ground that the Court neglected to address four points that were made very... you made nothing of them in the... in the argument or in the briefs.  It was almost not considered at all.  Do you mean that when a judgment is issued that is so clearly, in your view, erroneous, you can't come to the Court and say,  ""The judgment is erroneous, you forgot to address these issues? ""  I hope you can do that in a motion for rehearing.   Antonin Scalia  They would have to say not just that.  They would have to say,  ""The court did not deal with those four issues, and, therefore, its judgment was erroneous. ""  They would have to say that in order to... in order to act the way they did--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --because our judgment was ""reverse"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you say ""most favorable to its conclusion"", but did the jury conclude that there should be an injunction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's up to the judge.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, I mean, the principle that you interpret a verdict in the manner most favorable to its conclusion has no application here at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  You mean it's up... I don't understand that.  The judge, in order to issue the injunction, becomes a second factfinder, and he can find four... he can pick four out of the twelve, perhaps four that the jury had not picked?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, he can... he can actually make a finding.  And it... and it could be that the jury found that eight of them weren't valid, and the judge, in order to issue an injunction, can contradict the jury and say,  ""You know, I find that other four? ""   Antonin Scalia  Let me--   Antonin Scalia  --let me talk--   Antonin Scalia  --about the comma.  I don't... I don't... I don't understand your argument on that point.

""  comma... that's the comma you're talking about?   Antonin Scalia  ""# or threatens physical violence to any person or property. ""  but it continues,  ""in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section. ""  Now, the only thing that this section has, prior to that statement, said to be a violation is obstructing/delaying by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""Plan to do anything in violation of this section. ""  which is not just obstructing commerce, but obstructing it by robbery, extortion, or attempt or conspiracy to robbery or extortion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is... what meaning do you give to the phrase  ""in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section? ""  Under your interpretation, you could just drop that... drop that phrase completely.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's not a violation of the section.  1951.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're saying we... you can use it to aggravate the punishment for some other offense, but this does... this does something quite beyond that.  It says it is a separate offense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Chemerinsky, I... you said earlier that our... that we ""reversed and remanded"".  That was not in our opinion, though, as it sometimes is,  ""Therefore, you know, the case is remanded. ""  It doesn't say that.  Our opinion here just says ""reversed"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It just says--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --""# reversed"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I see.  And they interpreted ""reversed"" to mean ""remanded"".

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They didn't look at the last line of our opinion, which said ""reversed"".   Antonin Scalia  It's a broad principle.

I guess that respondent uses the language in the way it... he says it should be used when he refers to a contract that is void ab initio.  There's no such thing as a contract that is void ab initio, is there?   Antonin Scalia  If you take the meaning of contract that he takes in section 2.   INTERRUPTING ",04-1264
0,"Antonin Scalia  Every usury case, for example.  That's very few?  I mean, that's a lot of cases.   Antonin Scalia  What about fraud in the inducement?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You get rid of them after frustrating the arbitration provision, the whole purpose of which is to keep you out of courts.  I'd like to... I'd like to ask you about your argument on section 2, which--   Antonin Scalia  --appears at page 3 of the petitioner' s brief.  If you want to read it the way you're reading it, you say a written provision in a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce.  You say that has to be a... a contract that is a valid contract.  Well, what do you do about the end of section 2 which says, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract?  That would apply to... to contracts that are not... not void but voidable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So Southland was wrong.   Antonin Scalia  Why?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why would you make that... that weird distinction--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and treat the first part of it as though it applies across the board to the entire contract, but the last part of it, reading it differently?  I... I don't understand that.   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me even if you separate it, you still have the language, save upon such grounds that exist in law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.  Unless you take that language, the reference to contract in section 2, as referring to two separate things, the contract without the... without the arbitration clause and the arbitration clause alone, it seems to me section 2 doesn't make any sense.   Antonin Scalia  Doesn't it... doesn't it follow from... from that theory of yours that in every case you are entitled to a judicial determination, not an arbitrator's determination, but a judicial determination that this was a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce?   Antonin Scalia  Wow.  So in every... every case, the person who... who is being brought to arbitration can say, I deny that interstate commerce is involved in... in this... in this contract and I want to have a... a judicial determination of it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, that's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --The question isn't whether the court can... can determine that fact.  Ultimately, if the arbitrator determines it incorrectly, you can take it to court.  But the question is whether in every arbitration case, you can go immediately to court to have that question of interstate commerce or not determined.  And that would really throw a monkey wrench into the whole system, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  Once the case is in the court, of course, the court has to decide that question.  Once it is in the court.  And it was in the court in... in Prima Paint.  The question is does it have to go first to the court before it goes to the arbitrator, and... and Prima Paint doesn't decide that question.   ",04-1264
1,"Antonin Scalia  Or the other side may say,  ""Although technically the statute of limitations applied here, taking all considerations into account we think that this prisoner acted with reasonable promptness, and perhaps the delay was somewhat attributable to the State.

Antonin Scalia  But you... it could be argued that the Federal Government wants to move them along speedily, whether or not the State government wants to.

It's a Federal... it's a Federal interest involved, not a State interest.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why does... proceeding under 15 does not do that; whereas, proceeding this way does?   Antonin Scalia  Wink, wink?   Antonin Scalia  Must there be good reasons for the judge to say, quote,  ""I'm surprised that you haven't raised a statute of limitations defense? ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Must there be good reason for that?  And, if not, aren't you asking us to waste our time?   Antonin Scalia  Why don't you do it the easier way and--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, what's your answer as to whether there is any limitation on the judge just suggesting,  ""By the way, you know, is there some reason why you haven't pleaded statute of limitations?

And, if so, shouldn't we perhaps send it back to see whether, if the court knew that it had discretion, it would have done this?   Antonin Scalia  What if Congress wanted to leave it to the State to waive the statute of limitations provision?  How could it have made that clear?  I mean, I would have thought that if they made it a statute of limitations provision instead of a jurisdictional provision... I mean, they could have said, you know,  ""No jurisdiction if it's filed beyond a certain date, and we mean it. ""  But it put it as a statute of limitation, which normally is waivable.  And I would think that that is an indication that Congress thought,  ""Really, if the State thinks that in this particular case we shouldn't hew to the technicality of the statute of limitation, the State ought to be able to waive it. ""   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's always a technicality.  What you're saying is, the only time that the State can do that is when the answer to the statute of limitations is unclear.  And I'm saying sometimes the State may say,  ""The answer is clear, but doggone it, this is just too picky picky, too technical in this particular case. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You acknowledge at least this much, or am I incorrect?  And it's important for me to know that.  You acknowledge at least this much, that if we read this opinion, as you do not, to be saying that the court ""must"" do this so that the court was not really considering all factors in the exercise of its discretion, we would have to remand.

If... if you just say whenever you... whenever the prosecution has a strong case, you can't introduce other guilt, or whether all that the court is saying is that one of the elements that you consider in determining whether to admit this... this third party is not just... it's the comparative weakness of the third party case.  You don't blind yourself to... to the strength of the prosecution's case.  Will you say it was bad even if it was the latter that the court was... was referring to?  Are you saying you cannot consider the strength of the prosecution's case at all in determining whether to allow in third party guilt evidence?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Blume, I... I know you're more concerned about... about what result you get in this case and... and whether your client gets another trial or not.  I am more concerned about... about the rule of law that we're going to apply in the case which will affect a whole lot of other trials, and I... I frankly think we're playing with fire.  I... I worry about criminal trials turning into circuses in which... in... in which the police are put on trial, which is part of what is happening here and what has happened in... in a famous recent American case.  I worry that... that that will be the... the result if... if we take your suggestion, which is to prescind from any consideration of the strength of the prosecution's case and simply look at the... at the alleged third party guilt evidence on its own without... without any consideration of its relative... its relative strength.  Just... you want us to do it just absolutely.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think... you think there's no difference where really very questionable evidence about some third party's guilt is... is produced in a case where... where the State's case barely makes it over the... over the line to get to the jury and you think it's... it's the same call where that barely questionable third party evidence is... is put in in opposition to a State's case that is... is watertight... I mean, you know, forensic evidence, all sorts of proof.  You... you think the two have to be treated the same.   Antonin Scalia  Does the other side agree with that?  I... I'd be surprised if that were the law in the other 49 jurisdictions, that the judges just blind themselves to the... to the prosecution's case when they make these calls.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's your authority for... for the... for opposition that every other jurisdiction does it that way?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We're not arguing about that.  I... I don't think anybody has asked you that question.  The question is whether you can consider it at all, and... and you say no.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not... not harmless you mean.   Antonin Scalia  It's not what the court said, though.

Whatever else it said, it didn't say that.     No, it didn't say that.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Yes.  Now, you say that's true.  Now, it may well have been true, but that... we're... we're--     The trial judge said that.  The trial judge said it lacked the type of corroboration.   Antonin Scalia  --That's right.   Antonin Scalia  And as I recall, the trial court did say that this was pretty persuasive evidence but for the fact that you had to exclude some of it because that there was no exception to the hearsay rule.  Didn't he say that?     It... they said that the evidence existed, that the statements--   Antonin Scalia  He said more than that.  I think he said it was--     --there was some evidence--   Antonin Scalia  --Well--     --that allowed for--   Antonin Scalia  --Your friend will tell us what he said.     --that allowed for a jury to make the determination.  That information was there.  But also, it's... the judge found that there wasn't other evidence other than the statement that clearly pointed to the defendant... excuse me... that clearly pointed... pointed to Jimmy McCaw White--   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Zelenka, do you agree that all 49 other States do not look at the... at the weight of the prosecution's case when making this decision?     --No, I... I do not agree with that.  And... and we've cited in our brief Kansas v. Adams.  We... we do not analyze those cases to make a determination as to what the trial judges and the other State courts did not look at.  We think it's implicit, in fact, in most situations, that you have to consider to some extent the State's evidence to determine the reliability of the nature of the third party guilt evidence which comes in.  You have to have--   Antonin Scalia  Excluding the confession.     --Other than that information in the confession, which he had also found previously lacked appropriate corroboration at the trial... pretrial hearing as evidenced within his written order.

And the more you narrow the obviousness standard to these three imponderable nouns, the more likely it is that the patent will be granted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  You keep coming back to Asano.  Why do you keep coming back?  Your claim here does not say anything about Asano.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think they happened to use Asano simply because that's what you stuck it on.  But I think their basis, their basic point, is anybody would have thought to stick it on, whether it's stick it on Asano or stick it onto some other mechanical accelerator mechanism.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And in the last year or so, after we granted cert in this case after these decades of thinking about it, it suddenly decides to polish it up.   Antonin Scalia  But the claim doesn't require that.   ",04-1350
0,"Antonin Scalia  Counsel, what... what do you do with our opinion in... in 1986 in Segura v. United States, which seems to me to contradict your assertion that you cannot separate, for purposes of the exclusionary rule, the manner of entry from the search?  In that case, the... the policemen entered without a search warrant.  So the entry was clearly a violation.  They left two officers in the room and other officers went back and got a search warrant.  When they returned with the search warrant, the two officers who were in the room proceeded to do a search, and we admitted the evidence.  It seems to me that in that case, we... we did succeed in... in separating the... the entry from the subsequent search, and I don't know why... why we can't do the same thing here.   Antonin Scalia  What... what were the exceptional circumstances?   Antonin Scalia  We're still, it would seem to me... I don't know... the warrant wasn't dependent on the initial entry?  You could also say the initial entry wasn't the product of the... of the later warrant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And therefore was unlawful.   Antonin Scalia  But we didn't hold... but we didn't hold that.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me?  No, I don't understand that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  I'm talking about only the evidence that... that was the product of the search conducted after the warrant was delivered.   Antonin Scalia  And that evidence was admitted in.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even though the entry of those officers was an unlawful entry.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, no, no.  The... there was no subsequent entry.  You said the initial entry was unlawful.  Those officers stayed there.  Their presence there was the product of an unlawful entry.   Antonin Scalia  Their presence was the product of an unlawful entry, and nonetheless, we admitted in the... the material that they obtained in the search after a warrant had been obtained.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is--   Antonin Scalia  --Is in the chair the same thing as on the chair?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You tell me something is in the chair.  Did they stuff it... stuff it in the cushion or what?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  So I... I--   Antonin Scalia  --I think it's pretty clear you don't talk of something as being in the chair.  It's on the chair unless you stuff it in the chair.  I assume he stuffed it behind a pillow or something.   Antonin Scalia  English is English.  You said it was in the chair.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Sure you would.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you'd deterred him more if you threw the whole case out, but we don't do that.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, we... we insist that the deterrence somehow be related--   Antonin Scalia  --to the... and... and the related usually means that the acquisition of the evidence was the product of the violation.  It was caused by the violation.  And... and for that reason, we keep it out.  And here, it's... it's hard to say that this was caused by the fact that they... that they entered in a few seconds too soon.  So he would have answered the door and they would have seen the stuff.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Although you say it can be retroactively validated.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, in Segura, you can retroactively validate it by... by getting a warrant afterwards.  Could it be... have been retroactively validated by knocking and announcing afterwards?  I'm... I'm sorry we came in too soon, and they run back to the door and they knock and announce and wait... wait 10 seconds.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would that do the job?   Antonin Scalia  The hypothetical sounds ridiculous only if one accepts your explanation of Segura, that... that it was somehow a retroactive validation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about just the former without the latter?  I thought the former alone would be enough.   Antonin Scalia  But I assume that lawsuits are allowable if... if knock and announce is... is not observed, and if you intrude upon someone in a state of undress.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't a civil lawsuit bringable?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wait a minute.  The government is not arguing here that... that it's valid.  It's just arguing that though it is invalid, the punishment for it should not be to let the criminal go.  That's... that's all they're saying.   Antonin Scalia  The punishment for the invalidity should not be the... the inadmissibility of all of the evidence of the crime that was found.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's quite different from saying that it's... that it's valid.  So I think they acknowledge that... that a lawsuit against an officer who knowingly dispenses with... with knock and announce because, as you say, he says there's... there's no consequence, but there is a consequence.  He can be sued.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And sometimes he may be going into the wrong house and the person suing him may not be a criminal, but may be some... some innocent... innocent bystander.  And... and what about... you know, you say there's no incentive to knock and announce.  There... there may... you don't know any Michigan cases in which a... a civil suit has succeeded, but I know numerous cases in which police who... who burst in without knocking and announcing expose themselves to danger, that is, to being shot at by a... by a householder who doesn't know that they are the police.  Isn't that enough of... of an incentive, the fact that you may lose your life?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about... you talk about deterrence.  What about their not getting promoted?  I assume that... that police departments, even if you have some maverick officers, that the administration of the police department teaches them that they have to knock and announce.  Or if it doesn't teach them that, then you do have a 1983 cause of action against the city, not just the officers.  And that... you know, that's a deep pocket.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  Really?   Antonin Scalia  You... you know, I'm the police commissioner and I have a policy that you... you obey the law, you knock and announce, and... and I know that this particular officer disregards it all the time.  You really think that's not going to go in his record?   Antonin Scalia  Mapp was a long time ago.  It was before 1983 was being used, wasn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You bet you.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know, I'd be worried... you know, bust in somebody's door... that the homeowner wouldn't shoot me.  Without announcing that I'm the police, he had every reason to believe he's under attack.  Isn't that a considerable deterrent?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Exactly.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure I agree with a point that you make in your brief that civil actions simply are of no use.  That might have been the case when we first adopted the exclusionary rule, but our docket is crowded with 1983 cases brought by prisoners, brought by convicted felons, and many of these cases are successful below.  What reason is there to believe that that wouldn't be an adequate deterrent?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, that same problem exists if the consequence is exclusion of evidence.  Courts are going to view it the same way.  You're not going to avoid that problem by excluding evidence.   Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, I mean, your point is, it's very hard to tell whether they waited long enough, right?  And that's why they don't win a lot of these cases.  But the same thing is going to be true if the consequence of not waiting long enough is the exclusion of the evidence.  The court is going to be very... it's going to be very difficult to tell if they waited long enough, and, as you say, the court is likely to say, you know, ""Let it go"".   Antonin Scalia  Our two cases did not... did not raise that issue.  The issue was not decided in those cases, was it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but here it was a warrant to enter the home, not to seize particular goods.  So, the entry of the home was not illegal.  The entering of the home was perfectly okay.  What was illegal was not knocking and announcing in advance.  It seems to me that's quite a different... quite a different issue, and the causality is quite different.   Antonin Scalia  I understand that, but the essence of the violation was not the entering; whereas, in the cases, the old common law cases you're talking about, the essence of the violation was the entering.  Here, the entering was perfectly okay; it was the manner of it, the failure to give the advance notice, that made it bad.  And that, it seems to me, creates a different situation.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Moran, these old common law cases you referred to, which held that a failure to knock and announce renders the entry unlawful, what was the consequence, in those cases?   Antonin Scalia  Right.  And the evidence would... if found, was not excluded, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, if we wanted to be faithful to those common law cases, we wouldn't exclude the evidence.   Antonin Scalia  Well, then you shouldn't have cited the common law case.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose there are a lot of other violations of constitutional rights by the police that are very hard to get at, and that cannot be remedied.  And I suppose we could punish them by excluding all the evidence, as well.  We don't do so, simply because there's no causality.  We insist upon a causal connection between the two.  It's not enough just to say the... this is the only way to stop the police from making the violation.   Antonin Scalia  What about our opinion in Ramirez, where the manner of entry was such that there was damage to property?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We didn't exclude the evidence there, did we?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, what had happened?  Had they broken a window on the way in?  Is that--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, the entry remains lawful, despite the fact that the manner of the entry, which included the breaking of a window, was unlawful.  I think what the Court meant was not, as you're portraying it, that, objectively, the entry was lawful.  I think they were speaking as a matter of law, despite the fact that the breaking of the window was wrong, the entry was lawful.  Just as your opponent is saying here despite the fact that there was no knock and announce, the entry was lawful.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought the Government's distinction was based on the fact that they were arrest cases.  I thought that's the distinction they were making.   ",04-1360
1,"Antonin Scalia  Don't argue it to me.  It doesn't make much sense.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any evidence that the citizens... that Michiganders are less litigious than people in other States?   Antonin Scalia  So... so the mere existence of suits in other States ought to suffice as something--   Antonin Scalia  --that's... that's a deterrent.  Shouldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, give some cases first.  He's talking about actual cases.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, isn't it possible that if his law clerk overlooked Segura, he overlooked other cases as well.   Antonin Scalia  There was unquestionably, was there not, a violation of the Fourth Amendment in Segura?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, you... so, you think it's possible that the defendant could argue that the evidence should be excluded because,  ""Had he knocked and announced, I would have run to the toilet and flushed it down, rather than-- ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --""# answering the""--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, why not?

0,"Antonin Scalia  The Government doesn't say that ""all"" are covered.  The Government acknowledges that there are some actions that could still be brought in State court.   Antonin Scalia  It's so... it's so counterintuitive.  As the Government points out, these holder claims lend themselves to abuse much more than do the narrow purchase and sale claims.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And why--   Antonin Scalia  --why the Government would want to police the one, and let the other, you know, proliferate, seems very strange to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, because they... I mean, the argument made by the Government  ""Of course not, because the only reason they're brought is precisely to evade this congressional legislation. ""  They didn't exist, before; and they've become common, afterwards.  Now... you know, I... you can say--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that they--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I thought that there were... well, never mind.   Antonin Scalia  What if I choose not to complain about my buying, I just choose to complain about my holding?  It's true, I was harmed because I jumped in.  And that's one harm.  But it's an entirely separate harm that I was induced to hold it--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --by these continuing misrepresentations.  Why can't that part of the suit be brought in State court?   Antonin Scalia  It is?  Okay.  So, you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you agree--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you agree that a buyer--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --who... whose purchase is excluded, can nonetheless sue--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in a State--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --No, no, no, no.  You bought--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in reliance--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --on the fraud--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?   Antonin Scalia  Why?  I have--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --a buying claim, and I have a holding claim.  Why do--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --What is there in the statute that says the two have to go with each other?   Antonin Scalia  Where?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I'm not making--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --a buying claim.  I... and there's nothing in my complaint about my buying the stock.  I say--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""# I was induced to hold the stock by these representations that occurred in February, March, April, and May.

""   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Frederick, it seems to me that the language ""in connection with"", you know, whether it means what Blue Chip meant or whether it means what the statute meant, is at least ambiguous.

But here, you have a statute, the whole object of which is preemption.

0,"Antonin Scalia  But why should that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --why should that make a difference as to whether it's retroactive or not?  I mean, if it... it seems to me you look to the activity that it governs.  And the activity that it governs is the deportation or removal from now on.  Now, you could argue that... if you want, that there are some due process violations in making that prospective law affect past activities as they do.  I mean, let's... one of the examples given in Landgraf, or at least in my concurrence in Landgraf, was a change of the law procedure so that expert testimony, which previously was not admissible, is now admissible.  Now, the person who committed the crime that's involved in the next case that comes up when that new procedural rule is applied, he can say,  ""Well, you know, you've changed... you've changed the rules on me. ""  ""When I committed the crime, the expert testimony wasn't admissible. ""  ""Now it is admissible. ""  ""That's not fair. ""  Well, whether it's fair or not is something we can inquire into under the due process clause, but nobody would say that that procedural change is retroactive.  And it--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --seems to me that's what's going on here.   Antonin Scalia  That wasn't my point.  My point--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --was, you look to the... to the activity which is governed by the new law.  In the case of the... of the expert testimony, the activity governed is the trial, so that law applies prospectively to all future trials.  So, also, in this case, this law applies prospectively to all future removals, QED.  It is not retroactive.  Now, you may have an argument, although I don't think it's a very good one, that there are due process problems involved in this prospective law.  But I don't see how you can call the law retroactive.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That doesn't affect--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --doesn't affect his reentry at all.  His reentry occurred.  It... how could it possibly have anything to do with his reentry?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That would apply new penalties to the reentry.  This law does not apply any new penalties to the reentry, it just... it just establishes a new regime for removing the person who has reentered.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but--   Antonin Scalia  --I think that's because they were using the version of stage one that you are using, which includes, in the consideration of whether Congress has been clear, an inquiry into whether the... whether the law is retroactive or not, which, as I understand it, should be left to stage two, exclusively.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your analysis in your brief mingles the two.  It says one of the factors that you can take into account in stage one is whether it's retroactive.  And as I... I don't understand Landgraf to speak that way.  I thought you were supposed to use all other indicia of legislative intent, other than the normal rule against retroactivity, in deciding congressional intent, and then you go to stage two, which is where retroactivity comes in.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but as the Government points out, that ""either before or after"" applied to when you had been deported--   Antonin Scalia  --not to when you reentered.  And what we're... what you're arguing for here is a rule that goes from the time of reentry, not from the time of deportation.  So, it's not really a parallel.   Antonin Scalia  I wish we could get some new vocabulary.  Terminology is destiny, and I really don't follow the discussion of speaking about whether it was prospective or retroactive.  I don't think, whichever way it applied, it is retroactive.  But the issue still remains, Did Congress intend pre IIRIRA reentries to be covered or not?  I--   Antonin Scalia  --I would consider that still prospective, but just note my--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that I don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --go along with you when you force this terminology on me, whether Congress intended it to be retroactive.  As I see it, the issue is whether Congress intended it to apply to reentries that occurred before IIRIRA was enacted.  I would not consider that retroactive, but it's still an open question what Congress intended.   Antonin Scalia  Why would... I find it difficult to understand why Congress wouldn't have wanted this to apply to illegal entrants who had come in before IIRIRA.  Bear in mind, these are people who have been deported once, already deported once, and then, in violation of the law, come back in again.  And there was a regime for deporting them, which allowed certain variations, which are eliminated by IIRIRA, permission for them to stay.  You really think Congress wanted to keep faith with the people who had, already have... having been deported once for illegal reentry... illegal entry... come in again... and you think Congress says,  ""Oh, well, you know, we have to keep faith with these people who are violating our law, and not... and not deport them except under the conditions that existed when they broke the law to reenter? ""  I find that a very... what should I say +/?  touching--  [Laughter]  --attitude for Congress to have.   Antonin Scalia  Not only the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --disincentives.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They were trying to get out of the country people who were here illegally, two time losers who were here illegally for the second time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why would he think that?  Why wouldn't he just think, being here illegally, he is subject to being deported under such rules as the country has for deporting people who are here illegally, whatever they may be, from time to time?  That would be my expectation if I came in illegally, in violation of the law.  I'm saying,  ""I'm here at the sufferance of the country. ""  ""I shouldn't be here.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even... even if the warrant did not specifically say that it was an anticipatory warrant and that... and that you can only execute it after the delivery?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But I thought that's supposed to be a... a magistrate's determination.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dreeben, could... could I ask you if the Government would... would defend a... an anticipatory warrant in these circumstances?  The postal inspectors know that the unlawful video has been put in the mail and they know that it... it is going to one of 17 individuals.  They're not sure which one of the 17.  So they go and get a warrant that says, you know... and... and it will be obvious in my hypothesis that the delivery of the video has occurred.  So can they get a warrant that says you can go in... it lists all of these 17 people.  And it says you can go into their premises as soon as you see delivery of the video.  Would... would you support that kind of an anticipatory warrant?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then... then... well, I'm sorry to hear you say that because then you are really not saying that there has to be probable cause.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because at the outset there's no probable cause to believe that any one of those 17... unless you think one seventeenth is enough for probable cause.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but I'm not talking about a particular location.  I'm talking about we know it's going to be one of 17... or make it 50, if you like.  We don't know which of those.   Antonin Scalia  We want a warrant that will let us go in immediately when we see it delivered.  Would you support that warrant?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.

Does the Government concede that when you have an anticipatory warrant, the warrant is not properly executed until the... the anticipated event occurs?     INTERRUPTING ",04-1414
0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Reichel, it... it seems to me it's part of your case that the probable cause must be in existence at the moment the warrant is issued and that the magistrate cannot take into account the passage of time.  Are you--  Suppose that... that policemen apply for a... a warrant in Manhattan which is to be served in Brooklyn, and it's going to... it's going to take half an hour to get there.  Everybody knows it's going to take half an hour.  And the probable cause that they come up with is they know that this mob leader is going to be in this apartment between 6:30 and 6:45.  Okay?  And they present the warrant to the magistrate at... at 6 o'clock.  It will take half an hour to get to Brooklyn.  The magistrate knows that when it's served, the mob leader will be in this apartment.  Can that... can that warrant issue?   Antonin Scalia  Right, and... and likewise, it... it would work the other way.  If the magistrate had the same facts, the... the mob leader is going to be there between 6:30 and 6:45, and the warrant is presented to him at 6:30, he would have to decline it because he knows by the time it's served, it's... it's going to be gone.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  So the magistrate is always looking to the condition when... when the warrant is executed, and that's all that's happening here.  There is probable cause to believe that this person will be receiving contraband.  There is probable cause to believe it because he sent for it and it was mailed to him.  It's just a matter of waiting till it gets there.  There is probable cause to believe that he will receive it.  And all you're doing is predicting in the future, saying the probable cause doesn't exist now, but it exists when the warrant will be executed.  I don't see... I don't see any real difference between that and the... and the mob leader example I just--   Antonin Scalia  --No, but it's probable.  At the time that he issues the warrant, it is probable that this person will be receiving contraband because they showed, you know, this guy sent for it.  He sent for the... these child pornography films in... in a... you know, a Postal Service rouse, and we mailed it to him.  It's probable that he's going to be receiving it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I--   Antonin Scalia  --can I take you through my... a variation of my earlier hypothetical?  You say that the magistrate can issue the warrant at 6 o'clock, although he knows that there really won't be the probable cause until 6:30.  You say that would be valid.  He could issue it in Manhattan knowing that it wouldn't be served in... in Brooklyn until 6:30.  What if the magistrate specified that out of an abundance of caution?  It's just the same case, but he writes on the warrant, this warrant is not to be served until 6:30.  Does that make it invalid?  Whereas, it was valid before, it's not valid if he... if he says I am anticipating what will be the situation when the warrant is executed.  He says it explicitly, it can't be served until 6:30.  Does that make it bad?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't it strike you as... as strange that it's perfectly okay if he issues it at 6 o'clock, knowing that it'll be... won't... that there isn't probable cause now, but there will be at 6:30 when it will be served.  You say that's perfectly okay.  But if he says it on a warrant, not to be served until 6:30, it suddenly becomes bad.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, I see.  So... so you say so long as you say something as clear as 6:30, that's okay.  It cannot be served until 6:30.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the conversation is not occurring right now.  The magistrate has to say in the future, when this warrant is executed, the conversation probably will be occurring.  Right?  And so also here.  You know, the... the receipt is not occurring now, but on the basis of all of the evidence before me, I think that that receipt will be occurring.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't the Government concede this point?  I had thought the Government conceded that this warrant would not have been validly executed if they went in before the triggering event.  Otherwise, there's no purpose in putting in the triggering event.  Maybe we'll have to get the Government to... to state that explicitly, but that... that's my understanding, that they acknowledge this warrant would not have been validly executed if they went in before the triggering event occurred.  If that's not the case, I agree.  I don't know why we took the case.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So who--   Antonin Scalia  --So who, what, and where includes when, but it doesn't include how.  Right?  Where... where do you derive this proposition?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, all... this whole argument begs the question.  It... it assumes that the particularity requirement includes time, not only who, what, where, but also when.  Right?  I mean, you... you acknowledge that if you're wrong about that, if you're wrong about the fact that who, what, and where automatically includes when, the argument you've just made doesn't get anywhere.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that's your argument, but you agree that if... if that argument is wrong, you're done.

Would it... would it be adequate notice in the... in the ordinary case to send notice by regular mail?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but do we have a case that says that, you have to use registered mail?   Antonin Scalia  I didn't think we did.  And it would seem to me that especially when you have the taxpayer's name and address on file, I doubt whether it would be a denial of due process to send notice by regular mail to that address.  And if... if that satisfies due process, the State would never have known that it did not reach the individual.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it seems... it seems mean to punish the State for going the extra mile and sending the notice by registered mail because that informed them that it didn't reach him.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would this case come out differently?  You know, if your client had an obligation to keep the State informed of... of his... his address so that they could send the tax bills to him, suppose the statute, in addition to simply reciting that obligation, said, and if the taxpayer does not keep the State advised of his current address, any notice mailed to the last address that he gave will suffice for all purposes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose it said that explicitly.  Would that... would that make this case come out differently?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  I mean, the State can punish people for not doing what the law tells them to do, and here the State is saying we tell you to keep us... you keep us advised of your... your address.  If you don't, I guess we could throw you in jail for half a year, but we're not doing to do that.  We're just going to say that... that your... your punishment for violating the law is that this kind of a notice will suffice.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but there... no, but this is a consequence of violating the law of... of Arkansas.  Certainly the State can impose consequences for violating its law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You know, and my next question is going to be, if you way it would come out differently, then isn't... isn't it sort of silly to make the State come on and say that?  If they could do the same thing by simply reciting what's going to happen, why... why should we make them do that?   Antonin Scalia  Could they fine him for not... could they fine him for not... for not keeping them advised of... of where... where his tax address is?   Antonin Scalia  They could.  Right.  Could they fine him... how much money did you lose here?   Antonin Scalia  Could they fine him $70,000?   Antonin Scalia  It's pretty harsh, but do you think this Court would strike it down?

I mean, it may be--   Antonin Scalia  --But isn't there a second purpose for... for sending it certified mail?  And that is, it assures that it doesn't get lost.  I think they track it closer.

Okay?   Antonin Scalia  Would you apply a different standard there than you would apply where... where the reason is some First Amendment reason?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But would you answer my question?   Antonin Scalia  It would be a different criterion... you... you say it's going to be different for the First Amendment and the... and... and the Equal Protection Clause, at least where race is involved.

I don't understand how you would apply the test, would... you know, would you have prosecuted anyway, when... you know, but for the malicious motive, when the person you're... you're suing is not the prosecutor.  It wasn't up to this person whether there would be a prosecution.   ",04-1495
0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. McCartan, how does... how does your standard work?  The same question I asked Mr. Kneedler.  The... the test you would propose is whether but for the retaliatory motive, the prosecution would have been brought anyway?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  I think they would say absolute immunity, not qualified.  I... I think they're saying if there's probable cause, the game is over.   Antonin Scalia  This wasn't addressing... this wasn't... didn't involve prosecution, though.  It didn't involve unlawful prosecution.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It... it was a suit against a prison.   Antonin Scalia  No, but... but we treat prosecutions quite differently.  We do not give, for example, absolute immunity to the wardens of prisons as we give absolute immunity to prosecutors.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is a specially dangerous area in which to allow litigation.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. McCartan, I... I still don't entirely understand what you would want the Government to prove under your system in order to... in order to... to win this case.  They would have to prove what?  That... that--   Antonin Scalia  --And it would not be enough to show that the prosecution would have gone forward anyway.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  You see now in... in the employment cases where... where somebody is dismissed for a... a racially discriminatory reason and... and you have to prove that the same action would have been taken anyway, you ask the person who fired them with the discriminatory motive whether that person would have taken that action anyway.  Whereas here, the person who brought the prosecution is not in this case.  It's somebody who gave information to the prosecutor.  I don't know how that person could... could possibly establish that the prosecution would have been brought anyway.  It wasn't up to him.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It had nothing to do with--   Antonin Scalia  --Do you think the defendant can subpoena the prosecutor?   Antonin Scalia  Why?  I thought the prosecutor had absolute immunity.   Antonin Scalia  You say he... he can't be brought into court to defend his own... his own judgment, but he can be brought into court when... when an investigator is sued in... in order to take his testimony as to what would have happened?   Antonin Scalia  Well, he may have done it voluntarily here, but I find it hard to believe that he could be subpoenaed, when... when he has absolute immunity from suit against himself, to testify in a suit against somebody else.  It seems to me a very strange kind of a--   Antonin Scalia  --Well... well, surely the prosecution--   Antonin Scalia  --Surely the prosecution would go ahead if there were probable cause.  No?  I mean, suppose it was brought up during the prosecution.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You mean to say if there was... if there was perfect probable cause for the prosecution, that you can stop the prosecution in its tracks by... by an allegation of the First Amendment violation?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. McCartan, what was the 1887 case or 1880--   Antonin Scalia  --I thought you said Armstrong.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought it was--   Antonin Scalia  --Right, because the prosecutor could have gotten a lot of other information from other people.   Antonin Scalia  And you're not going to throw out the prosecution just because this one piece of information was bad.   Antonin Scalia  Neither... neither does absolute immunity for the prosecutor distinguish between whether the prosecutor was acting just illegally or just acting unconstitutionally.  I mean, yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You apply the same rule there.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, well, your... your point that... that there... there has to be a difference between whether there's a constitutional violation or not in this context seems to me not well taken because we don't make that distinction in the context of giving absolute immunity to the prosecutor.

1,"Antonin Scalia  I must say, this--   Antonin Scalia  --this doesn't seem to me normal usage.  I don't think it... you know, if you see a rapids in a river, it would be strange to say the rapids of the Colorado ""discharge"" into the Colorado.  You're usually talking about a different body of water.  You could say the Green River discharges into the Colorado.  Likewise, a waterfall, you wouldn't say, you know,  ""The waterfall on this river discharges into the river. ""  It's part of the river.  But if it were a waterfall that brought a tributary into the river, you would then say that, you know,  ""the waterfall discharges into the Colorado. ""  or whatever river it enters at that point.  It seems to me very strange to talk about a river discharging into itself.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the--   Antonin Scalia  --the issue is not whether there is a discharge, as I see it.  The issue is whether there's a ""discharge into the river"".  And one does not usually speak of the ""river discharging into itself"".  That... it's the ""into"" that's the crucial part.  How do you distinguish this case from Miccosukee, if I'm saying it right +/?  yes, Miccosukee--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --where we had, you know, a pumping of water from one polluted body into another, and it was held... we held that that was not a discharge?   Antonin Scalia  It--   Antonin Scalia  --That's right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the crucial--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --word was ""discharge"".  The reason we held ""it was not covered"" is not because there was no pollutant.  It was clear that there was a pollutant.  But we held there was no discharge.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because there was no ""discharge of a pollutant"".  There were pollutants in... on both sides.  That... I think that was conceded in the case.  The reason the case came out the way it did was that we held there was no ""discharge of a pollutant"".   Antonin Scalia  Wasn't it conceded that there was a pollutant... that a pollutant was involved in that case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, what must have been the difference was that there was no discharge.   Antonin Scalia  There was no discharge of anything.  It was clear that if there was a... if there was a discharge, it was a discharge of a pollutant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, only if you assume that letting out the same water into the same river is pollution.  It seems to me you're begging the question.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --If there were a discharge of something into the river, you'd be able to move against it.  But the question here is whether there's any discharge into the river when you stop the river and then let the same river out.   Antonin Scalia  Are they maximums or minimums?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I expect that they're minimums.   Antonin Scalia  Well, any significant obstruction in the river amounts to a... creates a discharge.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Indeed, if it's a small enough stream, I suppose just swimming in it or lying sideways so you impede the flow, you are causing a discharge into the waters of the United States.  I find that peculiar.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it depends on how big the river is, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Section 402 uses ""discharge"" in the same sense, I assume.   Antonin Scalia  Why doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes--   Antonin Scalia  --It is... it is broader.  But if... the discharge of a pollutant into the same body of water does not constitute the addition of a pollution... of a pollutant.  It obviously is the addition of a pollutant.  The only reason you could say that taking it from one... pumping it from one polluted body to another is not a discharge of a pollutant, which is what we said in Miccosukee, the only basis for saying that is that there has been no discharge.  There's obviously been an addition of a pollutant to the... to the other body of water.  The only thing you can say is, there hasn't been a discharge.  It's... because it's the same body of water.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If, in Miccosukee, liquid of the same composition had been taken from another body of water, and from... not the body of water that was adjacent and which we held was the same body of water... with the same composition, and that had been added, do you think Miccosukee would have come out the same way?   Antonin Scalia  Really?  That you could take pollutants from a different body of water and add it to an already polluted stream?  I thought that was clear that that's not the case.   Antonin Scalia  Exactly.   Antonin Scalia  Because if it was one body of water, it was okay, and if it was two bodies of water, it was bad, right?   Antonin Scalia  But it would add pollutants to the other body whether it comes from the adjacent body or whether it comes from some distant body.  The only reason that the pumping from the adjacent body did not qualify is... not because there no addition of pollutants.  There would be an addition of pollutions from a distant lake, and you... we'd be able to hold a person liable.  The only reason there was no addition here was that there was... there was an addition here, but there was no discharge, because it was the same body of water.

It seems to me if you say... you're saying it doesn't make sense, so you got to pay for it.  I think it... it's much more reasonable to say it doesn't make sense, so you can't do it.

1,"Antonin Scalia  They could have done the same in 3731(c) also.  Instead of just saying any action brought under section 3730, they could have said any action brought under... which one?  (a) of... of... which is the one that allows the Government suit?   Antonin Scalia  (a).  They could have said (a), and they didn't.  They said all of 3730.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sloppy--   Antonin Scalia  --is what you can take.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it... is it a necessary element of a successful action for retaliatory discharge that... that the action under the False Claims Act have succeeded?   Antonin Scalia  What does the Government contend is to be done under (b)(1) when no violation of section 3729 is committed?   Antonin Scalia  We've done it for several hundred years, haven't we--   Antonin Scalia  --for all Federal causes of action?  We've... we've looked to State--   Antonin Scalia  What he's saying is it should be read to include only those causes of action under 3730 that the rest of (b) makes sense as applied to, just as in (c) the phrase, brought under section 3730, should be interpreted to... to include only those causes of action that the rest of that provision applies to, namely, those... those actions under 3730 that involve the United States.  I mean, that's... that's a perfectly reasonable--     --Section 3731(c) does not require, in its application, the Court to construe a civil action under section 3730 to mean anything other than what its words import because it only relates to the United States' burden of proof.  The petitioner suggested that it implicitly was limited to an action under 3730(a).  Well, that's certainly not true because if... if an action is brought under 3730(b) and the United States intervenes, section 3731(c) establishes the standard of proof.  If Congress were to amend section 3730(h) to allow the United States to bring a claim on behalf of the employee who was retaliated against, section 3731(c) would, by its terms, establish the burden of proof that the United States would have to meet.  So there is no inconsistency there.   Antonin Scalia  --You think... do you think Congress is more likely to amend 3731(b) to say clearly and non-sloppily what it means if we find for the Government here or if we find for the... I mean, for... for the side that the Government supports or if we find for the other side?     Well, Your Honor, I think that 3731(b) is capable of application exactly as written, and in fact, as we say in our brief, that that is the statute of limitations which most serves the purposes of the statute unlike the alternative the petitioner--   Antonin Scalia  What... what about this as a general... as a general principle of construction?  A court should not, unless there is no reasonable alternative, construe a statute of limitations provision in such fashion that the statute can expire before the cause of action arises?     --Well--   Antonin Scalia  Is that a reasonable proposition?     --No, sir.   Antonin Scalia  No?     There are any--   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me reasonable to me.     --Many States have adopted statutes of repose, and they apply to a cause of action that under State law accrues for purposes of statute of limitations upon the discovery of the injury.  But a statute of repose can come in and instead tied to the act, say, for instance, in which the date that a product was first sold into the market.  And so the cause of action, for purposes of statute of limitations, will not arise in many instances until after the statute of limitations has run because of a statute of repose.  So that it's certainly not unheard of in the law.   Antonin Scalia  But we don't run forward to create situations like that, do we?     Well--   Antonin Scalia  My... my point isn't that it couldn't exist.  I just said you should not interpret a statute of limitations if it is reasonably possible to avoid it in that fashion.     --Well, in the Bay Area Laundry case and in the Reiter case, the Court has acknowledged that there is a general rule that statutes of limitations start to run when the cause of action accrues.  But in each of those case... cases, the Court was very clear that that was the rule that applied in the absence of contrary indication by Congress.  And here we have a very explicit contrary indication by Congress, that the statute of limitations for any civil action under section 3730 runs from the date on which the violation of section 3729 was committed.  In other words, Congress has opted here to establish a single uniform statute of limitations for all claims that might arise under the False Claims Act.  And as I said before, that serves the purposes of the False Claims Act better, far better certainly, than petitioner's alternative.  As we have pointed out, many State statutes of limitations, assuming that one can determine which one applies of the many that might be offered, are much shorter than the statute provided for bringing the qui tam action.  As a practical matter, then an employee might be forced to split their claims.  If they split their claims, any number of adverse consequences follow.  First, they could find themselves barred from bringing a subsequent qui tam action on behalf of the United States by the public disclosure bar of the False Claims Act.  The Eleventh Circuit has a rule that says that the two claims are one for purposes of res judicata.  So in the Eleventh Circuit, apparently they could be barred by res judicata from bringing a qui tam action.  The disclosures in the course of the wrongful termination of retaliation claim action would, of course, alert the defendant to the scope and extent of any Government investigation.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask you--     --will be the same.   Antonin Scalia  --Can I ask you another textual question?  You... you want us to say that (b)(1) must apply to all civil actions under section 3730.  Must (b)(2) apply to all civil actions under 3730 as well?     The... the most close reading of the text would be that any civil action under 3730 can be brought within 3 years of when the official of the United States... now, we differ from the Ninth Circuit on this.  We believe that is only a Government official, in particular a Department of Justice official... knows of the facts relevant to bringing a cause of action that the United States could bring, i. e., the cause of action under 3730(a).  But we think that 3 years from that date in the action under 3730 could be brought, including the qui tam action or including a retaliation action.  But that reading is not essential to the position that we advocate here.   Antonin Scalia  So that... that could exclude even a retaliation action by an individual who... who doesn't... who doesn't know when the... when the individual... the official of the United States found out about those facts.  That... that doesn't seem to me very reasonable.     Well, of course--   Antonin Scalia  That provision is very... very reasonable as applied to qui tam actions.  It doesn't seem to me to make any sense as applied to a retaliation action.     --Well, Your Honor, it... it does make sense applying it to a retaliation action because it could be, for instance, the employee who was the individual who informed the Government official charged with responsibility to act of the facts that would warrant the United States in filing an action under 3730(a).   Antonin Scalia  It might be, but maybe the United States found out before... before that individual came forward.  Maybe there was an official in the United States.     That's... that's possible.   Antonin Scalia  And so he's... you know, he's... he's out of... out of time before he even knows about it.     Well, there may be events that--   Antonin Scalia  Strange.     --There may be instances where the employee would not know that they could take advantage of that provision.  But in the Bay Area Laundry case, the Court considered and rejected a virtually identical argument.  That case... the statute of limitations also was stated in the alternative, and the second one was 3 years after the information necessary to the claim had arrived.  And the party who was opposed to the position the Court ultimately adopted said that the Court's interpretation of the first of the two alternatives would render the second superfluous.  And the Court said, it may be superfluous to this category of claims, but it's not superfluous to other categories of claims, and so that does not prevent us from construing the first provision in the way that we are.  So likewise, even if the Court were to conclude that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a retaliation claim or unavailable to a qui tam claim, as some courts of appeals have held, it would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is unavailable, just as holding that 3731(b)(2) is unavailable to a qui tam relator would not mean that 3731(b)(1) is unavailable to a qui tam relator.  A couple of Justices, Justice Souter--   Antonin Scalia  No, but it... but it would mean that just as 3731(b)(2) can be selectively applied to some categories and not to others, so also, by parity of reasoning, (b)(1) can selectively be applied to some categories of violation and not to others.     --Well, again, we believe that the best, most faithful reading of the text is that (b)(2) is available to all causes of action under 3730.  The... Justice Souter asked a question about statistics and the frequency with which the claims are litigated together.  In a review of court of appeals decisions, there were 51 court of appeals decisions actually involving a 3730(h) claim.  Of those, in 32 the qui tam... a qui tam claim and a retaliation claim were paired.  They were litigated together.  In only 5 were both a qui tam action and retaliation claim brought, but brought in separate litigation.  So 32 to 5 is the relevant comparison there.   Antonin Scalia  What about the rest?     In... in--   Antonin Scalia  That's--     --14 claims an individual brought a retaliation claim but never brought a qui tam suit.  It may be that the Government had--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, I would count that as being brought separate.  I think you should add that with the other 5.     --Well, Your Honor, in... in fact, if we... if we look more closely at those 14 cases, 5 of them were dismissed because the plaintiff was not even involved in protected conduct under the statute.  So the closer you get to the core of what Congress had in mind, when it enacted the statute, of... of pulling out employees who have the information that only they have that the Government needs in order to recover fraud, the closer you get to that core, the more likely it is that the claims that are going to be litigated together.  And that's the way the Court ought to apply the statute.  It's the way Congress wrote the statute, to serve those purposes.  The... I... I think that the alternative of applying State statutes of limitations raises... North Carolina does not dispute that, for example, in Florida the... the analogous statute of limitations under Florida law... it's the Florida State False Claims Act which has a retaliation provision... would be 180 days.  180 days is far too short to put together the complicated qui tam complaint that is called for under the False Claims Act.

I don't read footnotes, normally.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What about the fact that a State has a lower income tax or a lower property tax than any other State in the Union?  Does that violate the Commerce Clause because it induces businesses to--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --The only one who gets the advantage of the lower... the lower income tax rate and the lower property tax rate is someone who is located in the State.  It's exactly the same.   Antonin Scalia  I told you, you have to locate... you'd have to locate in the low tax State to get advantage of the low... of the low tax.

Antonin Scalia  I understand that.   Antonin Scalia  I agree, but the question isn't whether it doesn't do anything; the question is whether you are still offering telecommunications services to the public.  And it seems to me... look it, I offer you broadband, initially without any information function at the end of it, and you're using this broadband to do all sorts of good stuff, going where you want, getting what you want, conveying what you want.  And then I change my rules and I say,  ""You know, in the future the only way I'm offering this broadband is if you, in addition to buying the broadband communications capacity, buy my information technology at the end of it.

Antonin Scalia  I understand what--   Antonin Scalia  --they're saying, but they're doing it all on policy grounds.  This definition means this, because that produces a good result.  With respect to telephone lines, they say, yes, bundled is, or it isn't, depending upon whether we like the result it produces.   Antonin Scalia  It just doesn't seem to--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, that's wonderful policy--   Antonin Scalia  --that's wonderful policy, but I don't... what I'm still waiting to hear is how you get that out of the definitions, which is the lever that the Commission is using to implement this good policy.  It is saying, in some cases, that a bundled offering is an offering of telecommunications; and, in other cases, it's saying a bundled offering isn't.  And the reason, you say, is not because of the nature of the thing, because of the definition, it's because you tell us it has good consequences in one case, and doesn't have good consequences in the other.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not my understanding--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --of how definitions work.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They claim that that's by toleration of the FCC.

In responding to Justice Souter's inquiry concerning the word ""knowingly"", you said the word ""knowingly"" appears later, so that it would be... it would be reduplicative.

I'm more concerned about the preliminary question of whether there was a liberty interest here.  I... I know you haven't challenged the existence of it, but I'm not sure that lets me off the hook.  We... we had a case some years ago in which both sides apparently wanted the statute in existence and they conceded in the... in the court of appeals that the statute existed and wanted us to say what this presumptively existing statute said.  And we held, since there was serious doubt about whether the statute had been properly enacted, we had to reach that question first because we were not going to speculate on what a, you know, hypothetical statute said.  And I think you're asking us to do sort of the same thing here.  You're... if... you know, without even conceding or... the Government doesn't concede anyway.  The United States doesn't.  You're asking us to hold that if this is covered by the Due Process Clause, what you've given here is enough.  But I don't... I don't like to speculate on... on hypothetical questions like that.  And it... it really seems to me that to say that there's a liberty interest here flies in the face of our more reasoned opinions in this area, especially Sandin which... which has some language that's... that's almost... almost right on point.  We note also that this... where is it?  Conner's confinement did not exceed similar but totally discretionary confinement in either duration or degree of restriction.  I...

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, you... you would make the same argument to that that... that you were making earlier, I assume, that to read it that way would... would be to nullify Calderon.   Antonin Scalia  I... I guess I'm... I'm not clear about the facts here.  Did... did the court... did the court comply with (b)?  Did it shorten or extend the time?  Was there any issuance of a... of a... of an order shortening or extending the time, or did the court just ignore the deadline and... and act later?   Antonin Scalia  So there... there is nothing from the court that... that says we... we shorten or extend the time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then I guess that the... that the conclusion would be, if you read 41(b), that if the court has not shortened the time, the court's mandate must issue 7 calendar days after.   Antonin Scalia  He couldn't have recalled the opinion because of the extraordinary circumstance.  My God, I made a mistake.  He couldn't recall the opinion, could he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't know that all the circuits have that interpretation.   Antonin Scalia  Has Justice Breyer conducted the kind of investigation he asked you about?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, it wouldn't have to suspend the rules for good cause since it has authority to extend the time for issuing the mandate.  It can comply with 41(b).  So I think the most you can say is that the court, when it's faced with extraordinary circumstances of... of the sort that could overcome Calderon, should issue and order extending the mandate because, and explaining why, because there's this evidence which, if true, would, you know, produce a miscarriage of justice in this case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Tell me again.  How do you... you read the rule to say?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Calderon requires not just that it might have been additional mitigation, but that the defendant would have been ineligible for the death penalty.   Antonin Scalia  That's how I read the case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I presume your... your answer would also be that if it's a good reason for... for not issuing the mandate, as you're supposed to, it would equivalently be a good reason to recall the mandate.  We... we crossed that bridge in Calderon.   ",04-514X
0,"Antonin Scalia  What do you do about... about the provision not of 41(b) but of 41(d)(2)?  There had been a petition for certiorari here, which was denied.   Antonin Scalia  Correct?   Antonin Scalia  And... and (d)(2)(D) says the court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.  That didn't happen.   Antonin Scalia  Don't you think it has to issue an order?  The State here, having received a judgment and... and seemingly a mandate has to issue after the judgment unless there's an order extending the time... went ahead with proceedings to... to set the execution, to have the... the person examined to be sure that he was competent to be executed, going through many stages, and was it proper for this court without... without ever issuing an order extending the time for the mandate, simply to come back... what... 18 months later and say, oh, by the way?   Antonin Scalia  They... they just do it even when they're delaying it for 18 months in order to reconsider the case?  I can understand they're just doing it when... you know, for clerical or other reasons, it... it comes out in 10 days or even 2 weeks instead of... if that's what you're talking about, that I can understand.  But here we're talking about a decision for a lengthy delay in order that the court may reconsider the case.  I would be astonished if it were regular practice for a court to do something like that without notifying the parties.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What I don't understand is how your argument fits in with... with the rule that you can't recall the mandate.  I mean, you have the same horrific situation.  My God, we made a mistake.  And we've held you can't recall the mandate unless these very high standards are met.  Now, are we going to hang on that technical distinction between not issuing the mandate forever and ever and recalling the mandate?  The court... a court has inherent power to recall a mandate, but we said you will not do it unless these very serious obstacles are... are eliminated.  And it seems to me, just as a court does have power to extend the time for issuance of the mandate, it makes sense to say the same thing.  You shouldn't do it unless these very serious obstacles are eliminated.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but they did grab it back from us.  I mean, if what you say is true, we should deny cert in all cases where the mandate hasn't issued or where the only stay for the mandate is pending disposition of... of cert. We should... we should put that in our rules.  They did snatch it back from us, didn't they?  What if we had granted cert?   Antonin Scalia  What if we had granted cert?  You... you say they then could not... what... what would happen then?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It wasn't stayed.  It just wasn't issued.   Antonin Scalia  So is recall permitted.  I mean, courts have inherent right to recall too.  I mean, the same--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the same situation existed in... in Calderon.   Antonin Scalia  Why wouldn't... but why wouldn't that be read in light of AEDPA as well?  I mean, whether it's a common law rule or a rule that... that's written down, why equally shouldn't they be read in light of AEDPA?   Antonin Scalia  Well, we don't... we don't have to be that harsh.  We can... I don't think that's the question.  I think the question is under what circumstances can you correct the error without having formally acted to extend the time for issuance of the mandate.  I think one can draw a distinction between the court just sitting there and doing nothing for a year and a half and... and then, you know, during which it's reconsidering the case without notice to anybody, and a situation in which a court takes formal action.  We're extending the time.  We could have a much lower standard for the latter than... than for the former.   Antonin Scalia  Well, this is... it's an abuse of discretion standard, and... and it is certainly reasonable to apply one standard for abuse of discretion where the court has entered an order notifying all parties that it's reconsidering the case and a different standard when it hasn't done that.  I don't... I don't think it has to be spelled out in the rule.   ",04-514X

I... you know, all of the things you say are quite true.  The question is whether the trial court had to come out the other way, whether it was just utterly unreasonable for the trial court to come out the way it did.  And that... you know, that's a... that's a heavy burden.  And... and it is a messy transcript and all of that, but I... I find it difficult to see how... how you can establish that... not only that... that the trial court could have come out the other way or, indeed, maybe in your judgment, maybe in my judgment, should have come out the other way.  But you have to establish that it's unreasonable not to come out the other way.  And... and I find it hard to... to see how you can do that when you have a transcript that relies, in part, upon the... you know, the rolling of the eyes and the... and the trial court says, I'm... I'm willing to give her the benefit of the doubt that that's the reason she did it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This prosecutor presumably appears before this judge on other occasions, and... and don't you think we... we can give some weight to the fact that the judge is there, sees the woman, sees what she's saying, and... and can judge better than we can whether she's making this up or just... just is... is somewhat confused, especially since, as... as I think the General pointed out, we're dealing with a kind of determination that is usually instinctive on the part of trial counsel.  There's just something about this, you know, and you move to strike.  I'm not sure it springs into your mind, at the time you... you move to strike, the precise reason.  Then somebody asks you later, why was it?  Why was it?  There was just something about that person I didn't like.  I know it wasn't the race.  That had nothing to do with it.  Now, what was it?  And then... then you have to recreate a... a rational process that, in fact, never occurred.  It was an instinctive process more than a rational one.  So I'm... I'm not particularly upset by... by seeing counsel flounder about in... in trying to come up with what the right reason was.  I think it's probably pretty hard to figure out.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm saying that it's hard.  That's all.  And... and that you can understand why somebody would flop around because, at the time the strike is made, I'm... I'm not sure it's always an entirely rational rather than instinctive action.   Antonin Scalia  Do you think that (d)(2) or (e)(1) is the... is the stricter requirement?  I'm really not sure which of the two.  Don't you think it... it might be possible to show, by clear and convincing evidence, that the State court decision was... factual decision was wrong, but you, nonetheless, do not show that it was unreasonable?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.   Antonin Scalia  Brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari.  You... you did not raise this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So... it's... it's brand new to us.  We... we didn't think this was in the case at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I... I thought the question presented... I didn't think.  I'm reading it from the petition for writ of certiorari.  In the absence of a contractual relationship with the defendant, are allegations of personal injuries alone sufficient to confer standing on a plaintiff pursuant to 42 U.S.C., section 1981?  So, I mean, the question presented was... was precisely if your client did not have a contractual relationship, would the mere allegation of personal injury, which you're now alleging, be enough to confer standing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, the question is... I mean, that begs the question, whether there has been a violation of section 1981, and the argument here is that there's no violation of section 1981 unless you're interfering with a contract of the plaintiff.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which you didn't allege and didn't even raise in the brief in opposition here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  His contract with... with the corporation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.   Antonin Scalia  That's exactly the issue.  And--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and that's how I understood this came... case came up here.  The contract you're relying on is the contract between the corporation... between the corporation and Domino's.  And can you... can you sustain a lawsuit for the violation of that contract?  There was no mention of any other contract.  I don't know why we should send it back down so you can mention a contract that you haven't even thought of even when you filed the brief in opposition.  So that's the issue, whether the violation of the contract between McDonald... between Domino's and your client's corporation will allow your client to get... to get some damages inasmuch as he was the target.  That's how I understood the lawsuit.   Antonin Scalia  Now, could you tell me when... the... the claim was settled when your client's corporation was in bankruptcy.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  And I assume your client had no... nothing to say about... about whether the settlement would be... would be accepted by the trustee or not.   Antonin Scalia  It was out of his hands, which means that, you know, you're... you're sort of pleading the advantage of a corporation, limited liability and all of that, and went through bankruptcy taking that advantage, one of the consequences of which was that you left it to the corporation to settle this claim.  And now you want to disclaim the advantage of a corporation and say, oh, although the... you know, the corporation settled it out... you know, I was no longer in control of it because of the bankruptcy... I want to bring the claim on my own.  I mean, I can understand why it would be nice for you to get that, but it doesn't seem to me that you should be able to play dog in the manger that way.  You either... you either accept the corporate form or you don't.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it was his... it was his corporation, and until he went bankrupt, any recovery by that corporation would have been a recovery by... by John McDonald.  What... what created your problem is the fact that... that the corporation went bankrupt.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But, you know, that's... that's one of the... one of the consequences of taking advantage of the corporate form.   Antonin Scalia  But it doesn't... it doesn't talk about personal injury that... that broadly.  It talks about the right to make and enforce contracts.  That's the portion of it you have to be relying upon.  It doesn't talk about--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --personal injury.  It's not a--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --it's not a more generalized tort.  If want to call it a tort, it is a tort that goes to your ability to make and enforce contracts.  I don't see anything--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --dignitary about that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you're saying it means discrimination that relates to the making and enforcing of a contract with somebody else.  And you're saying that since the discrimination was targeted at you, even though the contract was with... was with somebody else, you have a claim under this language of 1981.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But... but when you say damages that can be proven, the only damages you... you insist upon proving is the fact that you were a target and that it... it insulted you.  It... it was... you know.  That's the only damage you require.  So you're saying that every... every minority employee of all of the companies with whom GM, or whoever it is didn't do business, would automatically have a cause of action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  Okay.  Well, then... then what do they have to show?  They have to show that... that their salaries were... were reduced?  But... but you haven't shown that here.  You didn't plead that here.  They have to show... show that a contract with them was breached?  But you didn't plead that here and you didn't show it here.  So the... the only thing that... that you... you can answer is they would all have causes of action if their... their honorific values were somehow impugned.   Antonin Scalia  That was... that was the consequence of the bankruptcy of his corporation.  I mean, that didn't... didn't--   ",04-593X
1,"Antonin Scalia  And that determination of what was the weight of the evidence is typically left to the trial judge, rather than to the Court of Appeals.  It would be--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --somewhat novel for the Court of Appeals to be reviewing a trial judge on the basis of what it thought the weight of the evidence was.  It's one thing to say,  ""If he's denied or granted a motion for a new trial on that basis, we'll look for abuse of discretion. ""  but for the appellate court to do that de novo and assess the weight of the evidence, it seems, to me, quite unusual.   Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --it seems--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --it seems to me that if the Court of Appeals is going to grant a new trial, it must say one of two things.  It must say either, number one,  ""There was not sufficient evidence to go to the jury, but the conclusion of that determination ought to be... and, therefore, you know, the case is over. ""  but to say that and then say,  ""And, therefore, we give a new trial. ""  it seems very strange.  Or else, the Court of Appeals has to say, you know,  ""The weight of the evidence was not in the plaintiff's favor. ""  And if it says that, it's making the kind of a determination that I find unusual for a Court of Appeals.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I suppose they could make the same... if... I mean, if that follows, they should be able to do the same thing when there has been no motion made, neither before nor after, right?  They could say,  ""Well, there's no motion made. ""  ""We really have no authority to reverse this judgment. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""But""--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you know,  ""we certainly think there was not enough evidence, and, therefore, we grant a new trial. ""  Does any court do that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where no motion has been made--   Antonin Scalia  --neither before the verdict nor after the verdict, does any appellate court say,  ""Since no motion was made, we have... we have no power to reverse the judgment here, but our examination of the case indicates that there was really not sufficient evidence to go to the jury. ""  ""And, therefore, we will do the lesser thing and grant a new trial? ""  Does any court of... appellate court do that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is the usual practice with regard to the pre verdict motions?  Are... is the initial one made at the close of the plaintiff's case--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and then renewed at the... at the end of all of the evidence?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they're really different things to be reviewed at those two times.  I mean, at the end of all the evidence, there may be some matter that the defendant inadvertently puts in that makes up the deficiency in the plaintiff's case.  So, it's really a different motion, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of relief.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, well, I don't know that you have to read it that way.  I mean, you can say that the... when the... when the rule says that it... that it is deemed to have been reserved, it also implies that the question that was reserved is implicitly resolved when the court does not... does, later, not act.  It's an implicit denial.  Why can't you read the rule that way?   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure--   Antonin Scalia  --I understood.  Sorry.  Just... I'm not sure I understood.

If no verdict was returned, order a new trial, direct... Why does the rule only say,  ""In ruling on a renewed motion, the Court may?

Antonin Scalia  On... on what basis?  I don't understand it.  Certainly in the text of the jurisdictional statute, there's no such distinction.  What... what is the basis for it?   Antonin Scalia  And you think that that explains all of these cases.   Antonin Scalia  How did Congress... surely Congress did not expect any pronouncement of... of title by the Federal Government to be immune from challenge by private individuals.  If Congress did not anticipate that a wrongful assertion of title through the Federal Government could be challenged by a State action of this sort to clear title, how did Congress expect it ever to be challenged?  I mean, I can't imagine how else you... you would attack somebody who... who claims that he has Federal title.   Antonin Scalia  Which is what... is... how does that differ from what happened here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's exactly what happened here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and is that not precisely what Congress expected?  Did not Congress, in fact, approve this manner of challenging the asserted Federal title?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think you... you have to acknowledge there are at least three situations then: number one, where Congress did not create a Federal cause of action and did not expect that the States would create a cause of action to vindicate or challenge the asserted Federal interest; number two, where Congress did create a... a Federal cause of action; and number three, falling between the two where Congress did not create a Federal cause of action but, in the nature of things, must have anticipated that there would be State causes of action resting upon the Federal claim.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Congress would not have necessarily anticipated that the States would glom onto a Federal criterion for purposes of their State... of their State tort law--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --whereas here, Congress must have anticipated that quiet title actions of this sort would be brought.

Suppose there is a factual controversy as to whether notice was given and notice is required under the Federal statute.  Does... does that factual controversy with regard to an essential element of... of Federal law make it a Federal case?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it doesn't present any question of law, just a question of fact.  Let's say both parties agree about the law, but the fact that is determinative of nothing, except the operation of Federal law, is at issue.  Now, that... that would normally... under 1331, you'd be able to come into Federal court I suppose just where your only dispute is a factual dispute, but it is a factual dispute regarding the operation of Federal law.  What... what if this were just a factual dispute about the operation of Federal law?  What would we do with it?  Does the fact that it's a factual dispute make it not substantial, not a substantial Federal question?   Antonin Scalia  I suppose that happens pretty often in removal... in... in removed cases.  You really don't know what the defense is going to be.  If it's removed on the basis of the well-pleaded complaint, when the defense gets there, it... it may often be a State... a State defense.

If the Federal Circuit had said, oh, that requires your using a scale to see how much of one there is and how little of the other, but this Federal Circuit says, all correlate means is be aware of the fact that when one substance is high, the other two are going to be low.  That's all it means.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, please don't get off it... because this is my biggest problem with the case.  I agree that what you've said is simply a statement of the natural phenomenon, that when the one substance is high, the other two are low.  And simply to be aware of that natural phenomenon is all that correlation consists of.   Antonin Scalia  You mean life isn't a fountain?  [Laughter]   ",04-607X

[Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  No, it didn't ""stop it""--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but could the State allow it?   Antonin Scalia  And if the State allowed it, the Federal Government would have to allow the drugs to be used for that purpose--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you're saying.   Antonin Scalia  I would have thought that at the time this legislation was enacted, it would have been as unthinkable for a State to allow drugs to be used... to be prescribed by a doctor to kill a patient as it would be for drugs to be subscribed by a doctor to make the patient feel better.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, I think that assisted suicide would have been as unthinkable at the time this was enacted as prescribing cocaine just for recreational use.   Antonin Scalia  Which comes down to an argument that ""accepted medical practice"" means accepted medical practice State by State--   Antonin Scalia  --rather than on some uniform basis. Do you have any other area, regarding the enforcement of this Act, where the drug is allowed, or not allowed, to be used on the basis of divergent views of medical practice by divergent States?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Such as?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In palliative care?  And you think in some States you can... you can prescribe these drugs without violating the Act; whereas, in other States, the same prescription would violate the Act.   Antonin Scalia  Would it violate the Federal law in those other States?   Antonin Scalia  Oh.  So you say that in... with respect to many aspects of this legislation, what's lawful... and what's lawful depends upon the accepted medical practice within the State.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does this have to be reflected in the State medical board determinations, or just in what the... what the doctors in that region tend to think is a good idea?   Antonin Scalia  Any cases that you can think of where the same prescription has been held okay in one State and not okay in another State?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Atkinson, you've spent most of your time talking about the statute and the regulations.  Do you also make the argument that, even if the Government wanted to do this thing, it would be unconstitutional?   Antonin Scalia  But why would it raise a significant constitutional question?  I take it that it's none of the Government's business whether people gamble or not.  I take it, it's none of the... the Federal Government... I take it, it's none of the Federal Government's business whether people are allowed to drink at 21 or at 18, innumerable other things, which really are matters that belong to the police power of the States.  But the Federal Government has chosen to regulate those things through the use of its commerce power.  Is the drinking age any more a matter of... or any less a matter of State privilege than suicide?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, are those... are those entries of the Federal Government into the regulation of drinking age, are they unconstitutional--   Antonin Scalia  --or do they raise serious constitutional questions?   Antonin Scalia  Well, why does this one?  I don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, if ten States adopted assisted suicide, it might be a different... a different--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --constitutional--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --question.   Antonin Scalia  I would--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, you would.  I think--  [Laughter] It seems to me... it seems to me that you... that you cannot accept the premise that it guts the Act, if you come in here with the proposition, which you do, that what the Act says is whatever is accepted medical practice within the State is okay.  That's your principal point.   Antonin Scalia  But the Act does not refer to any overall Federal accepted medical practice.  It refers to accepted medical practice, State by State.  And, therefore, it in no way guts the Act if a State wants to let these drugs be used for, you know, make people happy purposes.  I don't see how you can accept the premise.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  These are all different manners of assisting people to stay alive or assisting people to feel better.  Assisting people to die is something of a totally different category.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't deny that.  I... I'm not taking a position on whether, you know, a State wants to allow it, or not.  I'm just taking a position on whether it was envisioned by Congress, in 1971, that accepted medical practice would include prescribing drugs to help somebody end his life.  And I don't think it... I don't think it would have occurred to Congress.   ",04-623X

Antonin Scalia  But what a strange provision.  I mean, who would have thought that he couldn't?  Why did--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --they ever put that provision in, unless it means something different from--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Olson, you mentioned Section 3410.  Where does that appear on--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I can't find it in anybody's--   Antonin Scalia  --Who is it taxing?  Is it taxing itself?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the tribe sells the gas--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  What if... what... perhaps the State expresses it that way just to cover some people who get their gas illegally, and they would say the tax is still due, even if you haven't gotten your gas from a distributor who has paid the State tax.  Wouldn't that suffice for why the court imposes the tax on the use, sale, or delivery?  Use, sale, or delivery.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  Your Honor, I think the term ""use"" is the distributor's use.  The scheme that Kansas has set up is a sensible one.  It is, the distributor gets the tax and then has three choices.  It can use it, sell it, or deliver it.  And if the distributor... if the distributor is... hasn't done one of those things, then it's... then it... then the distributor can be made liable for any tax increases that have... that happen while the distributor is holding the tax.  And so, in our view, and in every court that we're aware of's view... tenth circuit didn't decide this case on the assumption that this was a tax on receipt of fuel off the reservation.  What the tenth circuit said was that Kansas is now attempting to collect its tax for the first time, a tax on motor fuel distributed to Indian lands.  It is, again, the same thing--   Antonin Scalia  Who is... who is the tribe taxing?  Is the tribe taxing the purchaser of the gas?  Is that--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --No, it taxes--   Antonin Scalia  --Is that--   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --the retailer.  It taxes the retailer, Your Honor.   Antonin Scalia  --I thought the retailer was the tribe.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  It is.  It taxes the tribal station.   Antonin Scalia  So, it's taxing itself.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  It is, Your Honor, but that tax is--   Antonin Scalia  That's real neat.  I have never heard of that before.  [Laughter]   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, actually, it happens all the time.  Pennsylvania imposes a tax on State sold liquor.  North Carolina does it.  All the State run liquor stores are subject to a State imposed tax.  But--   Antonin Scalia  Cities and counties--   Antonin Scalia  --aren't sovereign.   Antonin Scalia  All the other sovereigns you mentioned do not consume the gas... or the gas sold to them is not consumed primarily on the roads of this State, except for cities and counties, which aren't sovereigns.  I mean, they simply aren't sovereign.  That's the State, itself.  They're subdivisions of the State.  So, it's making exemptions for its own... its own State, plus exemptions for sovereigns, where the gas sold to those sovereigns probably will not be used primarily on the roads of this State.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Your Honor, there is--   Antonin Scalia  It makes perfect sense.  I don't see there's any discrimination.   Ian Heath Gershengorn  --Mr. Chief Justice, thank you.

Antonin Scalia  I understand the purposes of the statute argument.  The purpose of the statute is always to provide relief to someone who's been injured.  And to conclude, from this, that, therefore, the burden should be on the other side, in order... in order that people who are injured can get relief, is... I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that will always be the case.   Antonin Scalia  That's fine.  I... that's one sort of relief.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the Federal Tort Claims Act, for all I know, says, in its prologue... or, if it doesn't, it should have, or it could have... the purpose of this is to assure that every person who's been injured by a... by a Government tort obtains relief.

Antonin Scalia  Mr. Hurd, here's--   Antonin Scalia  --here's my problem with your assertion that we have to decide it in the way that furthers the purposes of the statute.  We said, in other cases... and correctly, I think... that no statute pursues its purpose at all costs, that there are limitations upon its purpose.  It, of course, wants students who need this special help to get it, but it also does not want students who don't need this special help to get it.  And for you to say, ""There's no harm done"".  You know,  ""If he... if he's given it when he doesn't need it. ""  ""What's the problem? ""  ""He goes to a better school. ""  The problem is that this is not play money.

It obviously... you know, decision of hearing officer, administrative procedures, disclosure, evaluations, and recommendations.  And you think the Federal Government goes into all this detail and doesn't care who has the burden of proof?  That seems, to me, most unlikely.   Antonin Scalia  Well, there's no violation here.

It didn't proceed that way at all.  It says, generally, the United States can be held liable only when liability was attached to a private actor, blah, blah, blah, blah.  However, the United States may be liable, quoting from one of the ninth circuit's earlier cases, for the performance of some activities that private persons do not perform when a State or municipal entity would be held liable under the law where the activity occurred.  I don't see they are saying,  ""We are trying to predict what California would do in a private situation.

Isn't the members committee the board of directors of... of the joint venture?   Antonin Scalia  That's because it's a joint venture.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's the nature of a joint venture.  The board of directors is composed of people representing the various elements of the joint venture.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There's nothing subversive about that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but that's because the joint venture did not include... did not include a merging of the product as it did here.  Here, the gasoline from both of them was merged into one gasoline, which was sold and the profit of which was divided between them.  In... in Citizens Publishing, each of the newspapers continued to sell its own newspaper and to... and to reap whatever profit it could make from its own newspaper.  That's fundamentally different from here.  There... there still is competition between the two newspapers.   Antonin Scalia  But they were competitors.  They were... each one of them sold its own newspaper.  All they merged was... was their publishing facilities.  And when they agreed separately not to... to charge the same price for the newspaper, that was not part of the joint venture.  That was, indeed, an agreement between competitors.  There were two separate newspapers selling on the basis of their own distribution system and so forth.   Antonin Scalia  Of course--   Antonin Scalia  --they're not able to fix the price unless they have market dominance.  I mean, do you think they're just competing with each other?  Aren't there other companies selling gasoline?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I don't think that this... this joint venture would have been allowed if... if these two companies together dominated the market.  Of course, it wouldn't have been allowed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You mean fix prices successfully.   Antonin Scalia  Fix... fix prices and not be an idiot at the same time.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Alioto--   Antonin Scalia  --Who... who is it that you would have had the price set by?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's their gas.  Okay?

Gave whom--   Antonin Scalia  --They did give them independence.   Antonin Scalia  That is--   Antonin Scalia  --They gave their board of directors independence.  Now, the board of directors was composed, as... as boards of directors of joint ventures are, by the parties to the joint ventures.   Antonin Scalia  Who... have you answered my question?  Who would you have wanted to set the price in this case?   Antonin Scalia  But I think they did say the former.  You... you make the price decisions.  Equilon.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I guess we've already construed it broadly, haven't we, in... or, excuse me... yes, construed the waiver broadly.  In Kosak versus United States, we allowed a suit against the United States for negligence of a mail truck in an automobile accident.  I suppose the language could have covered that, couldn't it?

It could have been negligent... what is it +/?  negligence--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in the delivery of mail?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.

Antonin Scalia  You would--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --say that that would--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --be covered.

Antonin Scalia  Except that you... my biggest hangup... and I wish you'd go through your distinguishing of it again... is the... is the Kosak case.  Carrying the mail in a mail truck is the handling of the mail.  There is no doubt that it's the handling of the mail.  And it seems to me it doesn't... it isn't enough to say,  ""Well, other people drive trucks, too. ""  Well, that's true.  But other people deliver packages, too, and leave 'em on the doorstep.

What's the basis for that distinction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but I don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand your last distinction.

So the only question here is whether the constitutional protection of States' sovereign immunity can be taken away by the Bankruptcy Clause; whereas, other provisions clearly can, right?   Antonin Scalia  To say... to say that the State can't be sued is not the same thing as saying that the State can sue, is it?  You--   Antonin Scalia  --you can prevent the State from suing, even though you can't sue the State.  There's no incompatibility, is there?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I suppose you could say that a... the intangible of a contract claim is part of the estate, too, right?  It's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --But, I mean, you could be... there's no less reason to say that that's part of the res than there is to say that the preferential transfer is.

And I guess you could have a suit for that gold bar or for the piece of property.  And I guess you could call that an in rem action, if you wanted to.  But it wouldn't be.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about a rescission action in which the private party has conveyed property to the State, and the State doesn't pay, and the private party seeks to rescind the action and to receive back the property that it turned over, which is real estate or a gold bar?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, if you are appealing to this broader principle, that you either waive all of sovereign immunity or you waive none of it at all, and you can't just restrict it to the particular claim, which is what (b) says, I don't know why, in any case, that wouldn't be true.

Antonin Scalia  Would you explain to me again why it's okay that your waiver argument below was only directed to the claims against VMI?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not... I didn't understand your answer to that.  You made a much narrower argument there than you're making here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You didn't... you didn't assert that all the sovereign immunity for the entire State and all of its institutions had been waived simply because of the claim by VMI.  You didn't make that argument.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What... which said what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then why didn't you make the argument?

It's a separate argument from the abrogation argument.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you're making it as a separate argument here.

1,"Antonin Scalia  What's the practical consequence of the one or the other?  Number one, if you don't raise it below, you can still raise it on appeal if it's jurisdictional.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  And number two, the... if it's a jurisdictional question, it would be decided by the... by the judge rather than by the jury?   Antonin Scalia  But that's always the case.  I mean, why... you know, if those disadvantages... those disadvantages will always exist.  So why would Congress ever make something jurisdictional rather than simply making it an element of the cause of action?  You understand what I'm saying?  I mean, that's always a consequence.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And yet, you... you felt that some things are jurisdictional.   Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  You... you pleaded... you pleaded that... that the defendant was... was an employer under the act.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  And it's the definition of employer that says he has to have more than... more than 15 employees.  So, in effect, you... in making your complaint, you... you at least implied and maybe said that this person is an employer under the act.  So it seems to me at that point the... the burden shifts to the other side to say... the burden of going forward of saying no, this person isn't an employer under the act, and if they say nothing, then they've accepted what... what your complaint on its face says.   Antonin Scalia  I knew you would.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Does it... does it have to be resolved preliminarily?  Why can't you leave the jurisdictional question to be decided at the conclusion of the trial with all the other questions?  Is there some rule of law that says that a jurisdictional question must be confronted before the trial and before the merits?  Indeed, most jurisdictional questions are reexamined as the trial proceeds.  That is, you know, initially the court will say, yes, there appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the pleading.  Then if there's a motion to dismiss, yes, there... there appears to be jurisdiction on the basis of the affidavits.  But then if the trial proceeds and it turns out that, in fact, there isn't jurisdiction, the court dismisses.  So why couldn't this jurisdictional question always be handled that way?  Just... just leave it to be resolved during the trial.  It wouldn't slow anything up.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So this is a third consequence of the jurisdictional issue.   Antonin Scalia  If the issue is jurisdictional, all the pendant State claims don't belong there and they've got to be chucked out; whereas, if it just goes to the merits, the pendant claims are properly before the court.   Antonin Scalia  That's an important consequence.   Antonin Scalia  Do you think... do you think it's possible that... that Indian tribes could be jurisdictional but an employer couldn't?  I mean, it seems to me the two the questions are quite different.  An Indian tribe is always an Indian tribe.  Right?  And you're... you're excluding... just as a prosecutor is always a prosecutor.  You're excluding a whole category of people.  But you're... you're not excluding a category of employers here, are you?  Because it's a... it's a factual question, whether at the time of the alleged offense, the particular company was employing more than 15 people.  It isn't that this company forever has immunity.

For example, it defines on the basis of sex.  Now, if... if you contest whether a particular remark or a particular practice of the employer was... fell within that definition, was on the basis of sex or not, would you say that the court had no jurisdiction?

I can understand you're saying that there is harm done when a statute says,  ""The jury shall weigh the aggravating circumstances. ""  which are... have been specified and which are narrowing circumstances; there are only five named in the statute...  ""shall weigh the aggravating circumstances found to be true against the mitigating. ""  and it turns out that one of those five aggravating circumstances is unconstitutional.  Okay?  Then you have the jury weighing something that it shouldn't have weighed, because that aggravating circumstance was bad.  I don't see why any harm is done where you have a statute that lists aggravating factors, one of which is  ""heinous, atrocious, or cruel. ""  and that is later found invalid by the State supreme court.  But then, in the weighing process, the jury is told,  ""Don't just weigh aggravating factors, weigh all of the circumstances of the crime. ""  Now, it seems to me that the same jury that erroneously found, as one of the aggravating factors,  ""heinous, atrocious, and cruel. ""  would also have found that  ""heinousness, atrociousness, and cruelty. ""  to be one of the circumstances to be weighed.  So, what harm is done?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I hope so.

I mean, it's certainly worse if you're a triggerman, but I don't know what makes it... somehow it's mitigating if you were not the triggerman.  I would say that you're not guilty of something even worse.  But to call that a factor of mitigation--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --He wants to know whether you would like to be thrown--   Antonin Scalia  --into the ""Breyer"" patch.  I think--  [Laughter]  --I think the answer is yes.   Antonin Scalia  It's the same jury.  The same jury that found it atrocious and cruel in the guilt phase would find it atrocious and cruel in the weighing stage.  I don't see--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --But what... the specificity you need for the narrowing factor does not exist with respect to mitigating factors.  We've said anything can be a mitigating factor.  I find it impossible to believe that the California Supreme Court said not only is the phrase  ""heinous, atrocious, and cruel.

Something like seven percent of the total carbon dioxide emissions are attributable to automobiles in the United States?   Antonin Scalia  6 percent?  Thank you.

Antonin Scalia  I mean, do we know that that's a straight line ratio, that a reduction of two-and-a-half percent of carbon dioxide... well, two and a half overall would save two-and-a-half percent of your coastline?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  You have standing whenever a Federal law preempts State action?  You can complain about the implementation of that law because it has preempted your State action?  Is that the basis of standing you're alleging?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you know any case that has ever held that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Milkey, I had... my problem is precisely on the impermissible grounds.  To be sure, carbon dioxide is a pollutant, and it can be an air pollutant.  If we fill this room with carbon dioxide, it could be an air pollutant that endangers health.  But I always thought an air pollutant was something different from a stratospheric pollutant, and your claim here is not that the pollution of what we normally call ""air"" is endangering health.  That isn't, that isn't... your assertion is that after the pollutant leaves the air and goes up into the stratosphere it is contributing to global warming.   Antonin Scalia  Troposphere, whatever.  I told you before I'm not a scientist.  [Laughter]  That's why I don't want to have to deal with global warming, to tell you the truth.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, and I agree with that.  It is when it comes out an air pollutant.  But is it an air pollutant that endangers health?  I think it has to endanger health by reason of polluting the air, and this does not endanger health by reason of polluting the air at all.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it talks about air pollution all the time.  That's what the, that's what the thing is about, air pollution.  It's not about global warming and it's not about the troposphere.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Milkey, do you want us to send this case back to the EPA to ask them whether if only the last two pages of their opinion were given as a reason that would suffice?  Would that make you happy?     Antonin Scalia  I didn't think so.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what I was asking, yes.  And you think it will go back to them and they will say, oh my goodness, the scientific uncertainty is not enough by itself?  You really expect that to happen?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They said it already.   Antonin Scalia  The only question is whether that alone is enough.   ",05-1120
1,"Antonin Scalia  I think it can be argued that the Assistant Attorney General hasn't argued that here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He has said that 6 percent is enough.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask about that?  I found persuasive Solicitor General Garre's point that in the acid rain context, it isn't air pollution that harms health, but rather it is the effect of the pollutant after it leaves the air and produces the acid rain.  Is there anything wrong with that response?  It seems to me--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You concede that it's an air pollutant that affects health?   Antonin Scalia  Then why isn't it air pollution within the meaning of the statute, although whatever it is that causes acid rain is?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you can't give me any text in this statute itself.  It isn't the phrase ""air pollution"" or any other phrase?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that gets us back to acid rain.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So that's the position you're taking, that it is within the general term?   Antonin Scalia  I presume the problem that they have in mind is that we have nothing to give in international negotiations.  If we have done everything we can to reduce CO2, you know, what deal do we make with foreign nations?  What incentive do they have to go along with us?   ",05-1120
1,"Antonin Scalia  They just have to say orally, I wish you would reconsider that?  Because if that's, if that's all you're arguing, I don't see anything to be gained by... by such a holding.  It doesn't tell you... you know, this is a suit against a number of large corporations, nationwide businesses, thousands of employees.  And on this complaint you have no idea who agreed with whom, where, when, any of that.  I can understand that you're saying that does not give us enough notice to prepare a defense.  But if you say oh, but it would be perfectly all right so long as they said orally.  I mean... forget about it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did you seek a more specific statement?   Antonin Scalia  Why not?  Why didn't you ask when and where was this agreement.   Antonin Scalia  What do you mean can be held, can be thought to hold that?  Is there any interpretation of what they did.   Antonin Scalia  And some parallel action would indicate that wouldn't it?  I mean, if for example they, you have nine companies that change their price at the same hour of the same day, 10 months in a row.   Antonin Scalia  So you're, you're not saying that parallel action can never create this, this kind of--   Antonin Scalia  --But what if it didn't?  I mean, I mean face the question that Justice Stevens puts.  Suppose you have a complaint that says nothing else except that these defendants entered into an agreement in... in restraint of trade.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Barnett, I thought--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Barnett I thought you had, you had said that you don't need to indicate the particular day of the agreement.  That it would be enough if it was the kind of parallel action that suggested an agreement that over nine years they all raised the price at the same time.  Now that doesn't really give the defendant notice of, you know, what individuals were responsible for this, when it occurred.  But you say that would still be adequate?   ",05-1126
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, i mean, you know, that's shame on them.  But we're trying to get this case right and, you know, I don't care what position they took before.  I care about what the right answer is, and I find it difficult to believe that you can simply allege in a complaint, I was injured by the negligence of the defendant in driving an automobile, period.  Does that satisfy the, the Federal Rules?   Antonin Scalia  Perhaps?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The agreement happens at one moment in time.   Antonin Scalia  Meetings of the minds, meeting of the minds.  I used to each Contracts.  Meeting of the minds at one moment in time, okay.   Antonin Scalia  I think, by the way, that that argument applies not just to the keeping out the upstart claim, but also to the not entering the other alleged conspirator s' fields of monopoly, if you want to put it that way, because if I, if I enter your field I know that you're going to enter mine.  It just doesn't pay for me to do it.  Yeah, I can make money, but I'll lose money.  It seems to me perfectly natural for companies that have a certain geographic area in which they are the, the principal, the selected instrument and although they technically can enter somebody else's geographic area, they know that if they do it they will be subjected to the same thing.  That is nothing more than conscious parallelism.   Antonin Scalia  After several years--   Antonin Scalia  --I used to work in the field of telecommunications and if the criterion is that happens which Congress expected to happen when it passed its law, your case is very weak.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you need what is called the plus factor, and I gather that you acknowledge that if I disagree with you that this, this parallel action seemed to be against the self interest of the companies, you no longer have a plus factor and you would lose.   Antonin Scalia  So all you have to do to prove, to establish a plus factor is to say in your pleading, and there is a plus factor?   Antonin Scalia  You have to say what it is, that's all, and even if it's implausible?   Antonin Scalia  How much money do you think it would have cost the defendants by then to assemble all of the documents that you're going to be interested in looking at?  How many buildings will have to be rented to store those documents and how many years will be expended in, in gathering all the materials?   ",05-1126
1,"Antonin Scalia  Did it, did it specifically state that, or is it that or just the principle that all Federal agencies have an obligation to--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't even think we mentioned them.  Did we mention them?   Antonin Scalia  Did we mention them in those cases?   Antonin Scalia  Well, maybe we just forgot.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I suppose if primary jurisdiction were a cure-all, there would never be any cases in which the regulatory scheme did not displace the antitrust laws.   Antonin Scalia  The EPA is not a hands-on regulatory agency the way the SEC is.  It has not been given an entire industry to regulate.   Antonin Scalia  Well, the Government says that's fine where the regulations have been issued, and where they... where they render the action here lawful.  There's no... no problemo.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Government's willing, in other words, to give the SEC carte blanche.  Whatever you say is lawful is lawful that won't violate the antitrust laws.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Extends a lot further, I would think.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So we could decide that way.  We could say, we don't have to decide what the standard is, even if it is inextricably intertwined as the Government does, you would win, you would be happy--   Antonin Scalia  But the problem you address has been a problem of strike suits.  And it is the problem that Congress addressed in its legislation.  Shake downs.  It just is less expensive to pay off the suitor than it is to litigate it to a final conclusion, where that conclusion is highly uncertain.  And I don't see how your... your solution of inextricably intertwined, where there's a penalty of treble damages if you guess wrong about that line, I don't see how that's going to stop the strike suits any more than the current situation does.   Paul D. Clement  Well, Justice Scalia--   Antonin Scalia  I wouldn't want to roll the dice on whether something is inextricably intertwined, with treble damages at the end.   Paul D. Clement  --Well, Justice Scalia, I think that you could certainly perform this test and make the test protect conduct sufficient to protect against that threat.  We are certainly sensitive to the threat that a regulatory agency is trying to draw a fine line between two closely related areas of conduct.  They're not going to be able to enforce that line as a practical matter if the regulated community knows that the consequence of having a foot fault in crossing that line will be treble damages in a class action suit.  On the other hand, we would caution against adopting some sort of broad immunity that would preclude, say, the Justice Department from investigating and prosecuting an antitrust conspiracy that cut across--  IPOs.  And of course, the Congress has addressed the problem of treble damages directly in a number of areas.  And I suppose, if they were to address the area in the antitrust context, they might draw a distinction between private treble damages suits and Government enforcement efforts.  Now, that's a little hard to do--   Antonin Scalia  What's your test, Mr. Shapiro?   ",05-1157
0,"Antonin Scalia  He's not saying that that's this case.  He's just saying that it's so easy to make allegations that action which was perfectly legitimate amounted to action that was illegitimate.  And that question ultimately gets thrown into the laps of the jury; and if the jury comes out the wrong way, you get hit with treble damages.   Antonin Scalia  I'm done.   Antonin Scalia  Why is that?  I don't understand why the SEC could not... they can make rules for a single IPO; it seems to me they can make rules for coordination of IPO.  Why can't they do that?   Antonin Scalia  Right, right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They have chosen not to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but--   Antonin Scalia  --But you... you could regard the activity of laddering and of making a book on a stock when the... in the case of a single offering.  You could... you could look upon that as, as an attempt to raise the price.  That's what it is, isn't it?  An attempt to make sure there's going to be a high enough price for the stock so that it won't flop once it's out there?   Antonin Scalia  Yeah.  And you're saying they did this just... not in the context of just single IPOs, but that they agreed across IPOs that they would all do this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?   Antonin Scalia  Uh-huh.  The customer being the issuer?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They'd have to pay the premium.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Look, the question isn't whether it satisfies it.  The question is whether you can get rid of this suit at the outset or do you have to go through enormously expensive discovery, which... which isn't worth the candle.   Antonin Scalia  --discovery?  Right?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think you've answered his question.   Antonin Scalia  I think that you've said that the two were different.  His question was how can you tell at the outset, at the 12(b)(6) stage, the difference between those two things that you've mentioned?  Sure they're different but... but the evidence that is only evidence of the one also looks like evidence of the other.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that wasn't the SEC's position below, was it?   Antonin Scalia  And the Justice Department was on one side, the SEC was on the other.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It looks to me like they split the baby up here.  [Laughter]   ",05-1157
0,"Antonin Scalia  But only if, only if the challenged evidence, the challenge to the evidence, if sustained, would necessarily... and this is the crucial language... invalidate the criminal conviction.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would necessarily have?  You could have said that ex ante?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't know what other evidence there might have been in the criminal case.  Ex ante you can't tell.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Again, you didn't, you didn't know that at the time the arrest was made, or at the time the confession was extorted, or at the time he was bound over.  You really didn't know that until the trial.  For all you knew, they might have found in addition to the confession, they might have found eyewitnesss who would have identified your client.  You couldn't tell that until the trial.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Until the trial, until the process of trial began.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the conviction in Heck existed at the time of the alleged tort.  And what Heck said is where you have an outstanding conviction, and you have a constitutional tort, you can't sue on that constitutional... and where... you cannot sue on that constitutional tort if the decision on the tort would effectively contradict your conviction.  Until the conviction has been set aside.  Well, this is not that situation.  There was no outstanding conviction involved.  So why did you have to wait?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would he have to sue on the first one right away?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Flaxman, before you save your time, I didn't understand why you're content with Justice Breyer's tolling situation, bearing in mind that the way he put it is, so long as the... as the criminal case is commenced within the two-year statute of limitations, how does that help you when the statute of limitations has passed?  Then there's no tolling.   Antonin Scalia  And two years doesn't seem to be unheard of.   Antonin Scalia  You're willing to let those people go?   Antonin Scalia  Those are the only defendants you are concerned about?   ",05-1240
1,"Antonin Scalia  Who is the defendant in a Fifth Amendment claim?  Is it the policemen who extracted the confession or is it the prosecutor who introduced it at trial, since that is the offense?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   ",05-1240
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I guess we could leave it up to them whether they want to disallow the instruction for a different reason, but the fact is they disallowed it for the reason that you say.   Antonin Scalia  And we can say that is error and remand it to them.  That might not make you very happy, but it would be up to them whether or not--   Antonin Scalia  --No.  If it had said that, I would have no trouble with it.  What it says is, you may consider it in determining what the reasonable relationship is between the harm caused to Jesse Williams and the amount of punitive damages assessed.  I don't see how injury to others can have any bearing upon whether the punitive damages bear a reasonable relationship to Jesse Williams' harm.  That's my problem with it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't.   Antonin Scalia  The jury can't really find that other people were harmed.  The jury doesn't have evidence before it except as to this person.  The most the jury can find, it seems to me, is that the, the activity engaged in bore a very serious risk of harming other people.  I think a jury could find that.  And therefore, the activity is more heinous and should be punished more severely.  But I... you don't--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, but I don't think I'm quibbling, but you seem to be conceding that this jury can decide that other people have been harmed and take into account the harm that it found other people suffered in deciding the penalty.  And I don't think this jury has any basis for finding that other people were harmed.  It could say there was a serious risk of it.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1256
1,"Antonin Scalia  You're losing me, counsel.  What, what specifically is wrong with the instruction proposed here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  As briefly as possible, one, two, three.   Antonin Scalia  Would it have been a proper instruction if the second sentence had read, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining what the... what that reasonable relationship is, although you may consider the extent of harm suffered by others in determining how heinous the crime, the action of the defendant was, and hence... what, what that reasonable relationship is?  If you had just added in that additional thought.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me that's all that's left out of it.  Now does leaving that out of it make it erroneous?   Antonin Scalia  Yes but reprehensibility analysis is part of the reasonable relationship.  The more reprehensible it is the higher the ratio can be, according to our cases as I understand it.   Antonin Scalia  You're saying this instruction was too favorable to you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --because it allowed them to consider harm.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you don't think they should have been allowed to consider harm, correct?   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, it seems to me the point you're making is not the basis on which the Supreme Court of Oregon said the instruction was properly disallowed.  The Supreme Court of Oregon said it was properly disallowed because you can take into account directly the harm to other people, isn't that the case?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Why not?   Antonin Scalia  So your only objection is that they left out the reason why it is relevant to determining what the ratio should be?  They just didn't say you can consider it in connection with reprehensibility.  Why is that crucial?   Antonin Scalia  But why was it critical?   Antonin Scalia  Too favorable to you.  Too favorable to you again, right?  [Laughter]   ",05-1256
1,"Antonin Scalia  Ms. Mahoney, let me ask you a question.  Am I wrong about this?  It seems to me that if he was not an original source, not only shouldn't he get any money, but neither should the government.  Isn't that the way the statute reads?   Antonin Scalia  How is there any other possible one?  It says there's no jurisdiction in this situation.   Antonin Scalia  It's not brought by the United States as long as he's still there.   Antonin Scalia  That's your argument.   Antonin Scalia  I guess it really depends on whether you think the language  ""if the Government proceeds with an action. ""  is equivalent to the Government's bringing the action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  It says under 3, what is it, (c)(3) I guess, if the elects not to proceed with the action, the person who initiated the action shall have the right to conduct the action.  Now, that suggests that if the Government intervenes the Government is proceeding with the action, right?   Antonin Scalia  But you say that's different from the Government bringing the action.   Antonin Scalia  You're being very picky-picky with this text, considering that you're willing to swallow whole the notion that so long as the... so long as the original party, so long as the non-government plaintiff drops out, all of a sudden it become as action brought by the United States.  That's a very, very expansive notion of what ""brought by the United States"" means.  What I'm saying is or, to put it another way, if you take your picky-picky notion of being brought by the United States, to be logical about it you must reach the conclusion that if you defeat the private plaintiff under... under he's not original source, the whole thing is thrown out, not just his recovery but the Government's recovery.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I know, but it would be so extreme that we're not likely to buy it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They don't have to give them any money, though.  The court doesn't have to.   Antonin Scalia  But you'd then have to pay his attorneys' fees.  That's what really this is about, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Factual theory of falsity, that doesn't mean anything to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Am, am I correct that they were, in fact, using that same pipe or that same pipe system during a period when perfectly fine cement blocks were being produced?   Antonin Scalia  Is that true, is that conceded?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You may find another one.   Antonin Scalia  What is your response to the Government's assertion, which seems to me quite true, that in order to... in order to prevail it did not have to show why these blocks were not solidified?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It just had to show that they weren't.  So it doesn't matter whether they were using his theory or too little cement.  It doesn't matter.   ",05-1272
0,"Antonin Scalia  Unfortunately, it was not the criminal conduct that was ultimately... it was not the manner of criminal conduct that was ultimately the basis on which the Government proceeded?  He knew about this bad pipe, right?  Or he said that this was a bad pipe system?  He didn't say anything as I understand it about their not adding enough cement which is the theory that went to the jury.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah.  Let me... let me look at what... let me look at 175.  This is, this what he says.  ""After careful study, I concluded that the suggested process. ""  --this means of piping the sludge out...  ""would result in an unstable mixture that would later deteriorate and cause unwanted release of toxic wastes to the environment. ""  ""I also noted based on my analysis of chemical processes at Rocky Flats that that the sludge and liquid present in the... present in the evaporation ponds contained some of the most toxic and radioactive substances at Rocky Flats. ""  I mean, that's all very good, but it has nothing to do with what this company was convicted of, which is not... cutting down on the amount of cement it was adding.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  During a certain period after this it was creating perfectly good blocks by adding more cement.  Then they got a new manager who said let's use less cement.  And that's when they started producing the defective blocks.  It has nothing to do with his allegations.   Antonin Scalia  And why did the government claim it was insolid?  What was the claim made for... as to the reason for the insolidity?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was... here's an easy question.  Was this evidence that we read, his testimony from 175 of the joint appendix, was that introduced at the trial?     Antonin Scalia  Was this evidence introduced from some other source?  Was the jury told there was this piping that was taking out too much liquid with the sludge?  Was the jury told that?   Antonin Scalia  So his central allegation was not even placed before the jury?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We've also said that jurisdiction must be maintained throughout the case.  Something like standing.  We say standing is examined throughout the trial.  There's an easier standard at the beginning, and then for the complaint; and then for a motion to dismiss, a somewhat higher standard; and finally, if the facts of... involving standing are tried, there's the highest standard at the end of the trial.  I mean, it seems to me jurisdiction has to be assured throughout.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's all very nice, but Congress didn't leave it up to you to decide who ought to get rewarded or not.  It laid down some textual conditions in the statute.  And unless they are complied with, the fact that you think this is the kind of person you think ought to get the money is really totally irrelevant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let's take this case.  Did the government use any of the evidence that Stone produced?  Did it introduce that affidavit which said the pipe wasn't working right?  Was that part of the evidence?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, what else had he provided beyond... did you use anything that came from him?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But did you use at trial anything that he provided you?   Antonin Scalia  Did you use anything he provided you in order to prove it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, neither am I.   Antonin Scalia  How is it possible to say that he had direct knowledge of events that occurred after he had left Rockwell?  I mean, all of this failure occurred after he was gone.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not only not because of this pipe thing that he predicted would cause a failure, not only it was not because of that.  But he was gone.   Antonin Scalia  That's right.  And how would he know except from published report that these blocks were failing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But prediction is not knowledge.  Prediction is not direct knowledge.   Antonin Scalia  And his sufficient information you assert is his prediction that these blocks would fail for a reason that turned out not to be the reason for their failure.  That is what you say is his direct knowledge.   Antonin Scalia  So you think relators can get part of the Government's recovery even where their initial allegations before the Government intervenes have nothing whatever to do with the reason the Government is ultimately giving money?  You think they are still entitled to a piece of the pie?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you don't believe that, then.  You think that indeed the reason the Government was given the money has to be connected with, with his allegations?  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Try this hypothetical.  The relator says: I know that they've been cheating the Government because I, I observed the president of the company going into a meeting with the chief engineer and another person, and at that meeting I suspect they were devising this scheme to defraud the Government.  It turns out there was indeed a scheme to defraud the Government, but that meeting never occurred.  It wasn't the president of the company who went into the meeting.  It was Charlie Chaplin.  And the facts are totally, totally wrong.  Does he get money?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does he get money just because he came out with the same charge that the Government ultimately proves?  Simply because he said the company is guilty of cheating the Government, even though the facts on which he bases it are entirely wrong?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, assume one that just gets over the line.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It turns out to be entirely wrong.  Turns out to be entirely wrong, so that the only reason he believed this company was defrauding the Government was absolutely wrong.   INTERRUPTING ",05-1272
1,"Antonin Scalia  Do they cite any particular document or statement--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that constitutes the delegation?   Antonin Scalia  Do all these contracting cases involve the contractor imposing law upon somebody, executing law?  On behalf of the Government?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because that's your test.  I mean, and if that is the proper test, it ought to apply in the Government contractor situation, too.  So, for example, the Government can hire a private company run prisons; but that would be the Government hiring somebody to perform Government... Government functions.  Now, do all of those... a function that remain as Government function, keeping the incarcerated incarcerated.  Now do, do all of the contract cases involve that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   Antonin Scalia  --But that puts a whole new theory on your--   Antonin Scalia  --Oh.   Antonin Scalia  And he was acting under color of law as you've described that in your petitions?  I don't think so.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I, I it seems to me color of office, you say color of office, it means that its appearance to somebody else is that... that he is being an official.  And I would think that that requires the fact that he's assisting a Government agent in enforcing the law against somebody.   Antonin Scalia  Just out of curiosity, what, what happens to the, the employees of the private companies that run prisons?  Could they removed under this provision?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They either run the prison for a State, or for the Federal Government.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --or the Federal Government.   Antonin Scalia  Is that the test here?  If it is State action, it is covered by this statute.  If it isn't, it is not?   Antonin Scalia  But suppose it doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Should I conclude it therefore is not covered?   Antonin Scalia  Do they test their products before they're marketed under rigid Federal testing regulations which are supervised by the Federal Government?   Irving L. Gornstein  Let me talk about... there are, there are numerous testing requirements.  The automobile industry has to test for fuel efficiency; it has to test for crash testing under very specific requirements.  The home appliances have to be tested for energy efficiency under Federal requirements--   Antonin Scalia  Is the Government supervising those?   Irving L. Gornstein  --Is... the Government often says exactly what the test has to be.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but is there some Government official who's there to make sure that the testing is being done the way, the way it's supposed to be, which is what, what is argued is the case here?   Irving L. Gornstein  Well, I... I... I can't say in every case that somebody is there to make sure--   Antonin Scalia  They don't have to be there every day.   Irving L. Gornstein  --But... the Government is--   Antonin Scalia  Policing--   Irving L. Gornstein  --Policing and enforcing the testing requirements, and there's testing in all these areas.  The other thing to say is that there's no--   Antonin Scalia  --I have a contract to provides food to the Senate cafeteria, okay.  And the Senate or maybe the Executive Branch, for that matter, closely supervises my preparation and service of that food.  Am I acting under, even though I'm not assisting the Government in any governmental function at all?  Don't you have to be assisting in the performance of a governmental function?   Irving L. Gornstein  But the problem with that, what you're saying, is the 1948 statute expanded it all Federal officers.  So if Federal officers were running that cafeteria, those Federal officers could remove because they are performing a duty under Federal law to provide that service to Federal employees.  Now, once the statute expanded out in 1948 to cover Federal officers who perform any function, not just enforcement functions, it carried with it persons who act under Federal officers in performing those very same functions.  So if the Federal Government hired an employee to serve food who was acting under a Federal officer who was responsible for the delivery of food, that person would be acting under a Federal officer within the meaning of this statute, assuming that the person was subject to the control, guidance, and oversight in the delivery of that food.  Now, this case is very far from the historical examples of citizens being called upon by customs officers to assist in the enforcement of the revenue laws or the chauffeur who was, under a Federal employment contract, who then... assisted revenue officers in carrying out a raid on a distillery, or the military corporal who was involved in assisting Federal officers in making an arrest.  Those are the historical examples.  They point to the principle that you are talking about people who are in a subordinate position and who are acting on behalf of or otherwise assisting Federal officers in carrying out their duties.  As for the alternative ground for affirmance here, that is that there has been a delegation, testing delegation of authority, there has been no delegation of authority.  It is unusual for the Government to delegate out its own regulatory responsibilities to the very industry it is regulating and it didn't do that here.  What the Government did is that it had at one time its own testing program.  It eliminated that testing program altogether, which had not been required by statute but was simply the result of a commission vote.  And after that, the industry continued to carry on the very testing that it had been doing all along as a result of an agreement among industry participants.  Now, even if--   Antonin Scalia  Well, how many others involve the agency calling the result of the private action the FTC figures and the FTC test?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they don't... they don't put it out to the public as the Federal Government's figures.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That makes a big difference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just don't call it the Government's test.  Don't call it the Government's figures.  Call it the industry's figures.   ",05-1284

Antonin Scalia  Have, have they imposed its official... has it imposed, the FTC, its official results on any company that was not a participant in this... in this testing lab?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your case would be stronger if they weren't doing it just for themselves.  If in fact that they were doing it for the FTC who imposed it even on somebody else.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because here you're doing it for yourself.  You want to advertise low... low... low tar cases.  And the FTC says the only way we'll let you do it, the only way we'll let do you that advertising is if you test them pursuant to this, this system that we established.  And you say okay.  We'll test them pursuant to the system you've established and... and everybody goes happily away.   Antonin Scalia  Well that's a good, that's a good preemption argument.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure it has much bearing upon whether--   Antonin Scalia  --It all comes back to me now, that case you mentioned.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Where... where is the unomitted language?  What... what page of the brief are you quoting from?   Antonin Scalia  Now, ERISA... ERISA makes it very clear that... that a plan to pay insurance for employee benefits, whether it's disability or retirement or whatever else, is an employee benefit plan and... and explicitly excludes workmen's comp because otherwise it would fall within that definition of an employee benefit plan.   Antonin Scalia  I know that's a different statute.  I'm not saying that the... that the definitions of that statute have to apply here, but the definitions of that statute at least demonstrate that it is a permissible use of the... of... of the term employee benefit plan.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.  Tell me why.   Antonin Scalia  Before you... before you go on, could you satisfy a curiosity of mine?  Maybe Mr. Verrilli should be the one I should ask this, but you must have your... your version of it.  How do you decide whether an insurance premium is for work that was done within the last 180 days?  How... how do you calculate it, whether that characteristic of the... of the statute is complied with?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, if it said premiums due within the last 180 days, I could understand it--   Antonin Scalia  --Or else establish that there's no conceivable way that 180 days makes any sense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We're together on this.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  The... the correlative hypothetical would be a plan such as Justice Breyer describes in which the employer has contracted to pay his employees $200 a month for when they're sick, and that's a contractual obligation of his, and then he buys insurance to cover that contractual obligation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You say that would be this case.   Antonin Scalia  And you say that wouldn't be covered.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where does (a)(3) appear?  There... there was that discussion in your brief, and I'm darned if I could find (a)(3).   Antonin Scalia  Well, it would have been nice to have it in your brief--   Antonin Scalia  --and numbered... numbered 3 instead of 4.  That would have helped a lot.   ",05-128X
0,"Antonin Scalia  You're begging the question by calling it a plan.  I mean, that... that's... that's one of the issues here.  Why don't you tell us what workmen's compensation laws require?   Antonin Scalia  What's your answer to the 180 days' question I answered... I asked?  You know, the provision provides contributions.  It doesn't say just contributions to an employee benefit plan.  It says contributions to an employee benefit plan arising from services rendered, and then it goes on to say, but... but the services have to be within the last 180 days.   Antonin Scalia  How do you square that with... with the purchase of block insurance like this?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But each of those insurance premiums that's paid by the employer doesn't just cover workers who worked for the last 180 days.  Each premium is divided among all the workers who've been working there for years.  Some of the premiums are going to go to... to allow the insurance company to pay in the future people who have been there for 20 years.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it just seems to me it's a square peg in a round hole.  I... I don't see how you make sense out of that 180--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You really think that... that they cut it that fine?  They say, oh, yes, this guy is going to go into bankruptcy.  We're pretty sure about that, but don't worry.  We'll have priority.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think as soon as they smell bankruptcy, they're going to pull the plug anyway.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It has to be arising from services rendered.  I mean, it... it really has to be part of the contract with the employer--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Verrilli, what... what is your response to Mr. Strain's assertion that if you get a priority, so should the secondary insurer, that is, the... the bank that gave letters of credit?  They're just insuring... that... that's part of the plan too.  They couldn't have gotten the insurance from you unless they got the letters of... of credit from the bank, which is a kind of secondary insurance.  And also in the case of self insurance, which is something of a plan... I... I guess you'd call it a plan... what about the... the person who puts up the bond?  That person is a kind of insurer, just as you are.  Do all of these people now... now get bumped up to the head of the line?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where... where does that appear?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, because it's not in the briefs--   Antonin Scalia  --just... just as the contract isn't before us.   Antonin Scalia  How do we know what you've just told us?  Is that in the record?  You're just assuring us what the content of the insurance contract is.  Right?  But we don't have the insurance contract.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So we... we have your assurance that that's what happens here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it has to be that way?  I could write a contract differently.   Antonin Scalia  That's a--   Antonin Scalia  --But it's not just to those.  It's to a lot of other people.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I assume that each of your premiums takes into account the fact that you're not only going to be paying for people, you know, who were injured between the last premium and now, but that you're also going to be paying for people who were injured a long time ago.   ",05-128X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I assume that the Federal regulating authorities require a certain ratio of loans to real estate value, things of that sort.  And I assume that the States may have different rules with regard to that; right?  In other words, the oversight might be different.  The States may be more permissive as to certain loans or as to, you know, what the balance sheet of the bank has to look like than the Federal Government is.  And if you have a State subsidiary that is overseen by state authorities, you might have a different result.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, if not I don't see any advantage in this great Federal banking system you're talking about, if it's Tweedledum and Tweedledee.   Antonin Scalia  I thought your point was that the statute defines national bank, but also defines affiliates, and refers to them as two separate entities.   Antonin Scalia  And I thought your point was that the effect of this regulation is to simply eliminate that distinction?   Antonin Scalia  I didn't understand that you made this--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Blanchard, if I could go back to what you were saying before this last line of questioning, I didn't understand your position to be that the OCC can come in and regulate this non-Federal bank up to the point where its... well, can do it apparently without limitation.  And where its regulation conflicts with the state regulation, the Federal prevails.   Antonin Scalia  Ah, or the more restrictive.   Antonin Scalia  The Federal Government says you can have outstanding loans of $10 billion and the state says no, you can have outstanding loans of 8 billion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wait.  What happens in that situation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, invent some other hypothetical then.  I'm talking about a situation in which the Federal law is more permissive than the state law.  Which law prevails?  The Federal law allows this bank to do things which the state law would not allow it to do.  As I understood your prior answer, you say oh, of course, if the Federal law allows to it do things the state law doesn't allow to it do, the Federal law prevails.  I didn't understand that to be your position.  And if it is your position, I don't know what all this fuss is about.  That's the end of the game, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Exempt from state examination?   Antonin Scalia  That's not the question.  Justice Ginsburg is trying to find out if you know any other situation where when the Federal agency doesn't do an adequate job, the state agency comes in?   Antonin Scalia  Maybe civil rights actions where there's a Federal agency that has some remedial powers and if the Federal agency doesn't act, the citizen is free to bring litigation in state court?  I guess that would be--   Antonin Scalia  --Did this go through your... can I just ask--   Antonin Scalia  --This still goes to the same thing.  Does Michigan do this by grace?  If Michigan wanted to, could it just tell the feds to butt out and say, you know, all these years we've been letting you come in first, and we only step in when we think you haven't done a good job, but we've had it.  [Laughter]  Especially after this lawsuit, get out, we're going to regulate our state banks?   Antonin Scalia  I know in Michigan.  I'm saying, could Michigan change its statutory scheme to kick the Feds out?  Or would that be prevented by this Federal statute we're discussing here?  I'm trying to see what you think this Federal statute does.  Or what the--   ",05-1342
0,"Antonin Scalia  I think, the question is not whether it can preempt State laws but whether the rulemaking authority can, can eliminate a, a basic division of the statute into a national bank and affiliates of the national bank.  The statute makes a clear distinction between the two.  And the effect of what, of what the agency has to done here is simply to eliminate that distinction, and to say really it doesn't matter.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you are an affiliate of a national bank, you have the same immunity that the national bank has.  That's not what the statute says.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, an operating subsidiary is an affiliate, right?  What kind of affiliates did they have before they had operating subsidiaries?  Did they rent pool halls, or what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I would have thought that any affiliate of a national bank would, would be engaged in essentially banking business.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is a functionally regulated subsidiary of a depository institution.   Antonin Scalia  And is that a functionally regulated subsidiary?   Antonin Scalia  If it's just engaging in banking activities?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What comes next?  Can the--  OCC say, well, the corporate law of this State doesn't really allow subsidiaries to do as much as we think a subsidiary of a national bank ought to be able to do, so we're going to attribute additional corporate powers to this subsidiary?  Can it do that?   Antonin Scalia  What troubles me, and maybe you can answer to it more specifically than you have, is that the core function of a banking regulatory agency is the visitation power, and the Banking Act makes it very clear that there is visitation power to national banks and makes it very clear that there is not for subsidiaries.  And here is a regulation which under the guise, it seems to me, of defining the powers of the national bank simply eliminates that distinction.  And it seems to me that perhaps goes beyond what an agency regulation is allowed to do.   ",05-1342

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Baker, I thought your position in your briefs, and I don't know why you do not make this reply to this exchange, is that the merger with another plan is not a termination, isn't that your basic position?   Antonin Scalia  Because if it were a termination, in a termination, you must distribute the assets to the participants.  And here when you merge with somebody else, the assets are not distributed to the participants, but they are thrown into a pot with other people.   Antonin Scalia  He doesn't like to hear that he is wrong.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe it's a simpler argument than this first one we've been wrestling with.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure I understand what you mean by a reversion to the employees who have made contributions.  They get their cash back?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   ",05-1448
0,"Antonin Scalia  Of course this argument would not have any force whatever if indeed, transferring the assets to another plan does not constitute a termination of the plan.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the first step would be the transfer.  And at that, at that stage it would not be a termination and therefore it would not be within the authority of the administrator under this provision.   Antonin Scalia  That's fine, but that still does not convert the termination decision into, into a, an administrator's decision, rather than a sponsor's decision.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure, you can oversee it and make sure that there is no hanky-panky going on in the two-step process but the... but the determination whether to terminate or not is a sponsor's determination.   Antonin Scalia  But they, but they don't say that in, in looking at the two of them, you suddenly transform the decision whether to, to transfer as... as a termination.  You transfer that decision from the plan sponsor to the administrator.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  And... and the argument your adversaries make is that termination requires that the plan assets be distributed to the beneficiaries.   Antonin Scalia  And that in the case of a merger the assets are not distributed to the beneficiaries, they are distributed to this new plan, which benefits not only the beneficiaries of this plan but the beneficiaries of other plans.   Antonin Scalia  Right.  But now, does indeed the transfer here meet the requirement of little (i)?  Does the transferee plan undertake an irrevocable commitment to provide to these beneficiaries all that they're entitled to, even at the expense of some of the other beneficiaries of that plan?  In other words, if the plan's investments go south does that plan have the authority to say, oh, you know, our first payments have to go to the beneficiaries under this plan that was transferred and the rest of you will get, will get the leavings?  I don't think that the plan has the authority to do that.   Antonin Scalia  Does it make a commitment, a commitment to fully provide all benefit liabilities under the now deceased plan?   Antonin Scalia  The other side said that the district court found that the argument was waived, or the court of appeals did.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't think, I just don't read 1341 the way you do.  It seems to me that little (i) at the top of your page 2a is a safe harbor.  I don't think that the, even if it is a fiduciary decision that he has to, once he has found an insurer that is rock solid, that is willing to provide all the benefit liabilities, I don't think he has to look throughout the rest of the world to see if there is anything that might be better for his plan participants.  I think that's a safe harbor and if he purchases an irrevocable commitment from an insurer and then that insurer is as solvent as any other insurer he is home free.  You're saying he is not home free.  He has to consider little (ii) and see what other ways of fully providing all benefit liabilities might be better for the plan participants.  I... I think that's, that's placing on him an obligation that I don't see there.   ",05-1448
1,"Antonin Scalia  Before you get into the substance let's... let's finish with this, this problem, whether it was indeed the other Secretary's own bill.  Was the Secretary who proposed the... the '94 legislation, the same Secretary who had promulgated the prior regulations?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The prior regulations were promulgated when?   Antonin Scalia  My goodness, that's a long time before.   Antonin Scalia  With a different Secretary now.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So there's no reason to believe that the same Secretary... that the Secretary continued to have the same view of what was proper, is there?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Indeed he could have copied the regulations that were on the book and just put them in the statute, couldn't he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was this the same Secretary, by the way, as the Secretary who issued the new regulation, the same Secretary that was in office when the new legislation had been proposed?   Antonin Scalia  Why, why would the--  Secretary, if indeed it was his bill, why would he deprive himself of the power to decide what the formula should be?  Which is the power he had before.  I mean, one must think that there must have been some pressures from elsewhere when the Secretary goes in and says take some power away from me, please.   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, I thought you said that you did know what it was.  I thought you simply quoted the statute, the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.  That's what's being distributed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Such revenues or expenditures in the State consist of, the word ""such"" obviously refers you back to some prior reference to revenues in the State, and that prior reference in subsection A is a reference to district by district, not pupil by pupil.   Antonin Scalia  I thought the problem was disparity in school districts.  Since much of the funding for education is local funding, in some places there are very rich school districts and very, very poor, poor school districts.  And I thought that the purpose of this was to make sure that there is not an enormous disparity, not pupil to pupil but district to district.  It makes perfect sense, it seems to me.   ",05-1508

Antonin Scalia  I still think it cuts against you rather than for you, the fact that they could have done the same thing here and we wouldn't have this case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Srinivasan, if we could come to the, to the text that you're talking about.   Antonin Scalia  What I don't understand about the Government's position is why you use this, this per pupil theory for purposes of (B), but don't use it for purposes of (A).  You, you don't... in the major computation portions, namely for purposes of paragraph 1, a program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local expenditures, if in the second fiscal year is made the amount of per pupil expenditures made by or per pupil revenue available to, you do it agency by agency, don't you?  You DON'T apply this, you know, it depends on how many pupils in each agency.  Why don't you do for both?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  You're saying it comes to the same, but the fact remains you don't use that methodology in A, because you don't think the language requires that methodology.  And it is the same language in B.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, the purpose would be to follow the language of the statute, and if you think that the language in B requires this kind of an approach you should take the same approach in A, especially if it makes no difference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would such be... of such expenditures or revenues.  That refers back to local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.  It's referring you back not to the totality of students but to, to agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you still have a Church of the Holy Trinity team over there somewhere, don't you?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  You know, I really don't care what the Secretary thought he was doing.  I mean, it seems to me we have to ask the question, what would a member of Congress who voted on this thing have thought he was voting for, who had, you know, didn't have this history you're giving us.  And more importantly, what would a citizen to whom this language is promulgated think the language means?  I don't care what the Secretary had in the back of his mind.  Why should that make any difference to us?   Antonin Scalia  Of such expenditures or revenues.   Antonin Scalia  So you've got to find out what ""such"" refers to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let me--   Antonin Scalia  --Let me ask you the same question I asked... I asked the Government.  Why don't you, if this is a natural reading, why don't you apply it to, to 2.A?  You don't even think of doing that in--  2.A.  In 2.A you just look at the individual agency, but it's the same language in 2.A.     ",05-1508
0,"Antonin Scalia  In the law, we don't... we certainly don't want to deprive any statutory provision of its whole purpose and effect.  And as I understand the purpose of this especially short statute of limitations, it is to enable the Government to dispose of the property that it has seized, and to be able to give clear title to it without somebody coming back, you know, many years later and saying this property should not have been taken.  How is that purpose served if indeed you can proceed under the provision that has a longer statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What if the amount wasn't paid and what if your client just sat back and the, the assets, or let's say some real estate were, were seized by the Government.  Would the 1346 action still lie?  Or is it only for return of money that, that's been paid to satisfy the tax?   Antonin Scalia  And that's the, it seems to me the principal problem that the Government was facing and justified the short statute, wasn't it?  That is the need to get, to be able to convey clear title to this property that it has seized.  But once... once the money is put up, and what the Government has taken is in effect payment of the tax, maybe there is no harm in proceeding under 1346.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm helping you.   ",05-1541
1,"Antonin Scalia  Was, was the more specific statute there enacted after the more general statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The reason I ask is we... we do have a principle which I think is a sound one, that repeals by implication are not fatal.  And what you're saying is that the enactment of the more narrow statute impliedly repeals the cause of action that existed under 1346.  Do you know if any of your cases that you cite, even those outside of the Internal Revenue field, involve more specific statutes enacted after the general statute that they supposedly limit?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I guess--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, that's certainly true when the two are enacted at the same time, obviously.  Or even when the, when the general is enacted after the more specific one and does not thereby limit the more specific one.  But, well--   Antonin Scalia  --Pre-Williams you're talking about?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did you make that argument, did the Government make that argument, in Williams?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, that... that Congress had enacted another statute which presumes that there is no cause of action under 1346?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but even if it wasn't available to her, the fact that there was another statute the whole premise for which is the unavailability of a remedy under 1346, it seems to me that would have, that would have strengthened the Government's case in Williams.

1,"Antonin Scalia  How would he make such a claim in this case where in open court he was asked by the judge, right, with nobody twisting his arm, whether it was the case that he did not want any mitigating evidence introduced?  And he said, right, yes, that's correct?   Antonin Scalia  I wouldn't agree with it.  I thought that the Ninth Circuit had been very clear that it did not agree with the district court's determination that he had waived mitigating evidence.  I thought the Ninth Circuit simply disagreed with that finding and remanded for a hearing on the mitigating evidence.   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that so?  I mean, that's what that... one of the reasons the case was here, that the Ninth Circuit simply smacked down a district court factual finding that he had waived any mitigating evidence.  Isn't that what happened?   Antonin Scalia  So it wasn't remanding for a hearing on whether he had waived mitigating evidence.  It made the determination that he had not waived it, and then remanded for investigation into what that mitigating evidence would be.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's clear at least that they disagreed with the finding of the district court that there had been a waiver, no?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it has not waived.  Not that the district court was... didn't have enough evidence before it.  It says the foregoing, Landrigan has not waived the right to assert a claim for effective assistance.  So how can you possibly say that that question is still open?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The district court has to accept that he hasn't waived.  And what it's sent back for is for all of the facts that show... that show he had ineffective assistance of counsel.   Antonin Scalia  The criminal gene argument.   Antonin Scalia  I thought all that evidence was basically before the district court anyway.  Didn't the district court know about all of that when it made its ruling?   Antonin Scalia  It's new to me also.  I never heard of it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Some kind of waivers, like waiver to the right to counsel, we do indeed require a colloquy, because a defendant is not likely to know what consequences of foregoing counsel are.  So the judge discusses with him and, you know, points out what a... what a significant decision that is.  But it doesn't take a whole lot of smarts to answer yes or no to the question, you know,  ""do you agree that your counsel should not introduce any mitigating evidence? ""  I mean, it's clear on, on its face.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, unless the argument is, and maybe this is what the other side its going to argue, that... that when you make waiver of all mitigating evidence, knowing as any person knows who's reached that far in the criminal process what mitigating evidence is, you must know, in fact, all of the elements of mitigation that could have been introduced.  Which will almost never be the case.  So that it's always possible after waiving the right to introduce mitigating evidence to come into the court a year later and say,  ""Oh, my goodness, here's the sort of mitigating evidence I didn't know about at the time.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I'm looking at page 92 of the joint appendix.  I don't, I don't see that.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's rather important, don't you think?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that effective?  Does the court have to entertain a motion for rehearing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't it your obligation to raise it in your original motion rather than in a motion for rehearing?   Antonin Scalia  But that wasn't your assertion even in this motion for a hearing.  It wasn't that he didn't know what he was giving up.  It was rather the sentencing transcript, you say,  ""does not establish that Petitioner knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently waived his right to present mitigating evidence. ""  ""Rather, it shows that Petitioner gave up that right without thought, in the heat of anger, and in frustration with his attorney during that particular proceeding. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that was a factual matter best, best disposed of by the judge who was present at the time.  And he didn't think it was in the heat of anger.  He did think that it was a valid waiver.  Now, you're raising a totally different issue.  You're saying, oh, he can't waive validly without knowing all the elements of mitigation that the waiver might embrace.  That wasn't the argument you were making here.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  This is belt and suspenders, that's all.  The... I don't think any judge likes to decide a case just on the basis of waiver.  This judge is saying he waived it and even if he hadn't waived it there's nothing there--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --because he wasn't bringing in at this point the biological... by the way, biological proclivity to violence is a mitigating factor rather than an aggravating factor?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand.  It seems unreasonable to me.  He was trying to spare his mother, what, the nervousness of testifying in court?  That's what he had in mind?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I'm not following you.  You mean the mental health expert's testimony could have gone to whether the judge should have accepted the waiver?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought that's what you were saying, I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  Where are you quoting from?  I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Verrilli, I thought you already conceded that the Ninth Circuit did not ask for a hearing on this question of whether he had waived, effectively waived mitigating evidence.   Antonin Scalia  That isn't what the Ninth Circuit said.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It found that he had not waived mitigating evidence.  So what--   Antonin Scalia  --Whatever.   ",05-1575
1,"Antonin Scalia  I'm surprised that that's the... I would have thought its primary purpose would be to spare individuals the necessity of supporting causes that they don't support.  Was there no First Amendment interest.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it only an election law interest?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you just said the State Supreme Court was wrong.  I mean, why do you believe it on this if you don't believe it on everything else?  You're appealing from it, aren't you?   Antonin Scalia  Let, let's assume that it makes a difference whether the purpose of the statute was at least in part to protect the First Amendment rights of the non-union members or whether, as the Washington Supreme Court seemed to say... at least they said its principal purpose was to protect the voting process.  Elsewhere in its opinion, however, the Washington Supreme Court says where a statute is ambiguous and this court is able to construe it in a manner which renders it constitutional the court is obliged to do so, which sounds to me like good law.  Wouldn't that apply to its intuition as to what the--  intent of the people who enacted this statute were?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wouldn't the Washington Supreme Court be obliged to intuit that purpose which would make it constitutional rather than unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are the courts in Washington State elected, do we know that?  Are they elected?   Antonin Scalia  They are elected, so it's easier to blame it on us than it is for them to say, we hold as a matter of Washington law that this can't be done and we disallow what the people have voted for.  That would be harder, a harder call, don't you think?   Antonin Scalia  Or even nongermane political expenses.   Antonin Scalia  Well, are there any other such entities that are given the power by the State to collect money from people against their will?   Antonin Scalia  That's my understanding, too.  I think you got to get out of it some other way.  I mean, you've got to say it's content but it doesn't apply when it's the government contributing money or it doesn't apply when you're applying it to money that's being coerced by the government.   Antonin Scalia  Can you get to the point you were about to make, what the purpose of the thing is?   ",05-1589
0,"Antonin Scalia  Is it content discrimination which subjects legislation to strict scrutiny if the Government, Federal Government or a State designates certain funds for use by school districts to teach patriotism, American history, something like that?  Is that subject to strict scrutiny?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Now let's assume it's not Government funding.  Instead of doing that the Government says, you will have authority to collect money from certain people only for a particular purpose.  Is that content discrimination which calls into play strict scrutiny?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't see why the one is any worse than the other.  The Government has a particular purpose in mind and in one case it gives out money with that purpose in mind, which discriminates of course; in the other case it allows this extraordinary power to exact funds from people, but only for certain purposes.  That's not the kind of content discrimination that they calls strict scrutiny into play, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Here is the Government acting as a coercer.  It's because of the Government that you're allowed to get this money from these non-union members.   Antonin Scalia  Which no longer exists if you don't make a timely objection.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Only if the State has given you the power to exact the money from these people.  That changes everything.  If this was money that they had contributed themselves, you'd have a different argument, but the State compels them to give you that money and the State says however, you will not use this money for this purpose without their consent.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That brings us back to the question I asked earlier and I suggested in my answer to that I don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government gives money for a particular purpose only and not for other purposes, and I also don't think it's content discrimination of the sort that triggers strict scrutiny when the government allows a private organization to use governmental power to exact money from people for a particular purpose only.  That's a different ball game.   ",05-1589
1,"Antonin Scalia  I don't understand it.  How can he be convicted of... of the consequential crime if he is never charged with the consequential crime?  You charge him with the... with the theft and convict him of assault?   Antonin Scalia  Okay, well I thought you... I thought you answered--   Antonin Scalia  --The theory being that anybody who intended to aid and abet a crime which naturally leads to another crime intended the other crime as well.   Antonin Scalia  And what about the remaining questions that were not decided by the Ninth Circuit?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do we remand for those or what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Himelfarb, you point out these last two issues are not, and probably correctly, that they are not fairly included within the question presented.  Well, that would be disabling if indeed it was the petitioner that is seeking to raise those two additional issues.  But here it is the respondent; and we can certainly reach those issues if we want to.   Antonin Scalia  The respondent can seek to uphold the judgment below on whatever grounds he wishes.   Antonin Scalia  So we can reach those other issues if we wish.   Antonin Scalia  Why wouldn't the better course be also not to decide the principal question you want us to decide on the broad ground that you want us to take, which is that if there are minor differences between what you might call the general law of aiding and abetting, it doesn't matter.  Why wouldn't it be wiser to decide this on the simple ground that this kind of consequential liability is part of the general law of aiding and abetting, which you argue in your brief?  So that would be the narrower ground.   Antonin Scalia  In that former question as to whether California theft is general theft, do you propose the same rule?  That even if California has some minor variations... not just in aiding and abetting but in what constitutes theft... minor variations from what the general national rule is, they should be disregarded?  And if not, why not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you would limit your rule just to aiding and abetting and not to other minor variations, just minor variations in the aiding and abetting definition?   Antonin Scalia  Is it the sentence given or the sentence prescribed for the crime?   Antonin Scalia  Given.   ",05-1629
0,"Antonin Scalia  Could I ask a factual question?  I'm just curious.  If the Government's statement of the facts here is correct, your client, a Peruvian, was convicted of burglary in 1992 and convicted of possession of a firearm by a felon in 1994, and nonetheless was made a lawful permanent resident in 1998.  How does that happen?  Is that a mistake or... how do we decide who's admitted as a lawful permanent resident?   Antonin Scalia  He's not a joyrider anyway.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You shouldn't steal it for an unreasonable amount of time, just for a reasonable amount of time?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand the concept of stealing something for a reasonable amount of time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You assert, you assert it's consistent with the majority view on this issue, not on everything.  What does it say about the death penalty?   Antonin Scalia  The joy apparently is you don't get convicted of theft.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Of course if you're right about this it would mean the statute is broader, but it would still be available to find out whether your client was in fact convicted as an accessory or as a principal.   Antonin Scalia  Now is that... is it possible?  Or is that out of the question in this case?   Antonin Scalia  Is it possible from pleading documents, from the charge, to determine whether he was convicted as an accessory or not?  And if it's clear that he wasn't, then we're just wasting our sometime in arguing this point, aren't we?   Antonin Scalia  No, no, no.  It says,  ""who at the time and place last aforesaid did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle. ""  I mean, he is... he's charged with being the person who took the vehicle, not, not some subsequent accessory.   Antonin Scalia  It is not a question of Cal... it is a question of English.   Antonin Scalia  We're not saying about what needs to be charged.  We're talking about what was charged.  And it seems to me there's no question what was charged is that he did willfully and unlawfully drive or take a vehicle.  There is no way you can consider that an accessory.   Antonin Scalia  But the charging document you acknowledge would suffice if it indeed is California law that in order to convict as an accessory you have to charge as an accessory?  You would acknowledge this?   Antonin Scalia  Partying maybe I would understand.  I don't know about joyriding.   Antonin Scalia  Wait a minute.  That's a real case?   Antonin Scalia  It sounds like the doctrine of unnatural improbable consequences.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Let me tell you, what's aberrant is the California interpretation of the standard doctrine that is used in many states, which is you intend the natural and probable consequences of what you do.  And if California has, some California courts have come up with weird notions of that, I don't know that that destroys the uniformity among the states.   ",05-1629
1,"Antonin Scalia  I don't know that I agree with that.  I mean, if this fellow driving 90 miles an hour is responsible for endangering people, you're proposing a rule that says if there's a 50 percent chance that he'll hurt some innocent person and a 50 percent chance that he'll get hurt if you try to stop him, you shouldn't do anything.  I don't agree with that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'd stop him.  I mean, he's the fellow that's causing the danger, endangerment, isn't he?   Antonin Scalia  I think you're giving away too much.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose there is also a high probability where you're going 90 miles an hour on a one-way road, crossing over the double yellow line, with oncoming traffic, that you're going to hurt somebody else.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, the more you increase the speed the more likely he's going to be hurt.  But also the more likely if you let him go somebody else is going to be hurt.   Antonin Scalia  Finish that.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  He reasonably... because Scott reasonably believed that he could bump the car off the road at 90 miles an hour without risking the driver's life?  Is that why it's like the Third Circuit case?   Antonin Scalia  Well, but the Third Circuit case you just described didn't talk about intent.  It talked about reasonable belief.   Antonin Scalia  It would might also be reasonable to assume that anyone who was chased by the police will immediately speed up to 90 miles an hour.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't seem to me a very good rule to give to police forces: Anybody who's going 72 miles an hour, let him go.  Or at least if he hits 90, let him go.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whether he is endangering anybody is a historical fact, no?  So what do you do about that finding?   Antonin Scalia  It is.   Antonin Scalia  I would hope he would wait until there were no pedestrians or vehicles coming before he, before he did the ramming.   Antonin Scalia  I assume he waited precisely for that kind of a gap in the traffic?   INTERRUPTING ",05-1631
0,"Antonin Scalia  He created the scariest chase I ever saw since ""The French Connection"".  [Laughter]  It is frightening.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  A frightening amount of speed, and cars coming in the opposite direction, at night, on a two-lane windy road--   Antonin Scalia  --But the issue in the case was quite simply whether there had been a seizure.  Isn't that the issue?   Antonin Scalia  Not if he is shooting his way out of the house and endangering other people.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, that's a factor here, of course.  If he has taken the jewelry and he's gone off into the night, if shooting at him might endanger somebody else, or even kill him, you have to let him go.  I'm talking about a burglar who is, you know, who is shooting as he leaves.   Antonin Scalia  Of course you can shoot him.   Antonin Scalia  Is that a factual finding of the, of the trial court here?   Antonin Scalia  Are we bound by that fact?   Antonin Scalia  Even if having watched the tape, there is no way that, that factual finding can be accurate?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Jones, could I--   Antonin Scalia  --Could I ask whether the portion of the opinion that you say establishes that he was not endangering anybody is this portion?  The court is mindful that traffic laws are designed to... safely... and Harris acted in an unsafe manner.  However, the record reflects ""# is this the portion""?   Antonin Scalia  ""# that he maintained control over his vehicle. ""  Well, that doesn't prove he's not endangering anybody.  ""Used his turn signals""... wonderful.  [Laughter]  ""And did not endanger any particular motorist on the road. ""  I think that's true.  In that scary chase he, he didn't come close to hitting any particular car, but I don't think that's, that's a finding that he was not endangering anybody.  ""Any particular motorist"", but he was endangering the public at large.   Antonin Scalia  It depends on how fast... if depends on how fast the car is going, whether it's a two-lane road or four-lane divided highway.  All those factors come into, into account.  And it doesn't seem to me that we have to adopt a rule that will, that will discourage police officers.  There's, there's enough disincentive to engage in this kind of activity in the fact that the police officer may hurt himself.  It's pretty risky to conduct this kind of a maneuver, don't--  you think?  I wouldn't have done it if I was Scott.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I would have let the guy go.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Driving 90 miles an hour and comes up, approaches that car, that car swerved.  Scott could have been killed, couldn't he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So I don't think we need a whole lot of disincentive to stop police officers in engaging in frolicsome conduct.   ",05-1631

Antonin Scalia  It was made in the Senate.  So the House presumably never saw the prior--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --language.   Antonin Scalia  And the President, who signed this bill, never saw the prior language.   Antonin Scalia  So, why should we attribute to both the House and to the President a knowledge of the prior version of the legislation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In the Senate.   Antonin Scalia  Please go over that again.  I'm not... I'm not sure I understood... I understood your response.   Antonin Scalia  You say that it could be read to preclude cases in the lower courts, but not here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Could I come back to Justice Alito's question as to what the normal procedure would be in criminal cases?  Suppose you're... you have a challenge to the makeup of the tribunal in a criminal case.  Is it... is it the normal practice that you would get to raise that challenge?  Let's say one of the judges is disqualified for some other reason.  Can you normally raise that challenge before the criminal case is filed?   Antonin Scalia  So, there would be nothing different in this situation, if you couldn't raise it until it was final.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, I know.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It goes to the merits of the issue.  I'm just talking about the timing of the issue.   Antonin Scalia  Well, when you say Congress hasn't fairly balanced it, I mean, I guess that depends upon your reading of the statute.  If, indeed, you read it the way the Government reads it, they would assert that Congress did consider these military commissions and thought that it was okay to wait until they had completed their work before full review was provided.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's sort of a... you know, a... you're running in a circle.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  As I recall the sixth amendment, you're entitled to know the charge against you.  And you're saying that the charge of conspiracy is not the charge of aiding and abetting.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You acknowledge the existence of things called commissions.  Or don't you?   Antonin Scalia  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --What is the use of them if they have to follow all of the procedures required by the UCMJ?  I mean, I thought that the whole object was to have a different procedure.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Katyal, you've addressed the Detainee Treatment Act in its... in its capacity as, arguably, removing jurisdiction.  Might not the Act also function as a retroactive approval of what the President has done?   Antonin Scalia  It depends on what you mean by ""regularly constituted"".  In your brief, I gather you... what you meant is that a court that was preexisting.  It doesn't necessarily mean that.  It just... it could mean one that was set up for the occasion, but was set up for the occasion by proper procedures.  Wouldn't that be a ""regularly constituted court""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, not ad hoc in that sense,  ""I'm creating one court for this defendant, another court for the other defendant. ""  but setting up for the occasion, and for trying numerous defendants, a new court.

We wait until the proceeding's terminated, normally.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  To a forum that is prima facie properly constituted.  I mean, it... this is not a... you know, a necktie party.  Where it parades as a court, and it's been constituted as a court, we normally wait until the proceeding's completed.

And if that procedure is done in a state of insurrection or invasion, that would constitute a suspension of the writ, even though they don't say,  ""We are suspending the writ of habeas corpus.

0,"Antonin Scalia  But that's different from putting it in.  I mean, you want to change what you... what you allege, that... that it's mandated by the Government to simply the Government, although it had authority to eliminate, did not do so?  If... you know, that's a different... different assertion.   Antonin Scalia  I'll assume it's the latter then.   Antonin Scalia  Those cases came from the days when we were also quite willing to imply Federal causes of action in statutes that had nothing to do with the Government, you know, 10b-5 and things of that sort.  I thought we had put all of that behind us.  You want us to go back to that bygone age.   Antonin Scalia  That's sort of queer terminology anyway.  Congress has already decided that there should be Federal jurisdiction.  It would seem very strange for Congress to say this strengthens the case for Federal... what do you mean the case for Federal jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We prescribe Federal jurisdiction.  I... you know, I'm not a fan of legislative history, but I... I don't find that particular piece very much against you.  In fact, it may be just... just the opposite.  It may be... it's lawyers' language, you know.  We don't know whether there's Federal jurisdiction or not, but this will make a better case for... you know, for the other side.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but... but... I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  It's a sloppy way to put it, don't you think?  Maybe what Congress should have said, although Congress doesn't always speak precisely, is that any... any State law which contradicts a provision of the contract on these particular subjects is preempted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I'll put it differently.  All State laws relating to subjects that are covered in the contract are preempted.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose there's a dispute in the... in the lawsuit about whether a particular benefit to which one party was entitled under the contract has been waived.  Okay?  That's the issue.  Is that issue to be decided by Federal law or by State law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I'm not talking about the... I'm talking about the claim, the claim made by an individual against the carrier.  And... and it is asserted that this claim should have been made sooner.  It has been waived by not having been brought forward sooner.  Okay?  That's... that's the hypothetical.  Do... do you think that that... that is governed by Federal law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whether waiver occurred or not.   Antonin Scalia  Why?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the text... the text only... only says, shall... which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits.  Extent of coverage or benefits.  I don't know that that relates to any of them.  It relates to whether the benefit that was covered has been waived.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't speak to it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So you're not saying that... that Federal law is... is pervasive here, that it covers the... the entire... the entire suit between the claimant and the insurer.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  In that respect, doesn't it differ from ERISA?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you're gong to make a lot of trouble for us.  We're going to have to sort out which of these things are covered by State law and which aren't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I wrote Boyle and what I thought I was saying was that the common--  [Laughter]  --was that the common law, Federal common law precluded, preempted any State law which contradicted this contract.  Now, you can... you can put that in a sloppy fashion by saying that the contract preempted State law, but it wasn't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that we thought it was the contract that preempted State law.  It was Federal common law which said that the contract... that any provision in State law which contradicts the contract is preempted by Federal common law.  And you can read this statute the same way.  It's a sloppy way of putting it, but what it means is Federal law preempts any State provision that is contrary to a provision of the contract--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which... which is certainly constitutional.

That's disuniformity.   Antonin Scalia  The Government... the Government as amicus?  The Government as amicus.

Even if they created a compact district but with the... with the intent of creating a majority minority district, that would be a district created for a racial reason.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even... even when the map is so... you... you acknowledge that the map that came out, after this... this realignment of districts, had less of a divergence between the voting strength of the Republican Party and the number of Republican seats than had existed under the previous allocation by the Democrats.   Antonin Scalia  But I'm saying less.  Less.  It... there's less of a divergence under the new map than there was under the old one.  The only difference is this divergence is in favor of the majority.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but what percentage did they have?  I...

Antonin Scalia  Do you have any... any authority either in the text of the Constitution or in a... a case for the proposition that the only reason a legislature can reapportion its districts is because there's been a census?   Antonin Scalia  Well, but that's your position when you said middecade redistricting is bad because your... your position is the only reason is the census is... has... has caused there to be less than... than one man/one vote.   Antonin Scalia  That... that little... even if it's done by the court.  I like the way you slipped that in.  I mean, even if you had a general rule that you cannot redistrict except after a decennial census, surely there ought to be an exception unless... which... which would read, unless the districting you're living under was never decreed by the legislature, but was decreed by a court.  And that was the situation here.  Surely, that's a good reason, even if you adopted your general proposition.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I'd say that's a shame for the democratic process.  I... I don't like the idea that... that there are a lot of districts out there that have never been drawn by the people, which is what the Constitution envisions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand.  Does this go to motive or result?  I mean, what if I'm... I'm stupid and I think there's the correlation and I remove it for that reason?  I'm not removing them for racial reasons.  I'm removing them because I want to remove Democrats.  And you're saying that if I have made a mistake about how solidly they vote Democratic, that turns my validly non-racial decision into a racial decision?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm assuming--   Antonin Scalia  --they're removing them because they're Democrats, but I'm wrong about that.   Antonin Scalia  I thought you said that the county was 92 percent Latino or something like that.   Antonin Scalia  Well, how can you... how can you possibly take out any substantial number of Democrats without taking out Latinos?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's my point too.

I don't understand how you can concede that... that refusing to invite somebody to lunch, if it's more than... more than a single lunch, could be a violation of 703.  How does that come within the... with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment?

But... but the... it seems to me the issue is whether a mistake was made that... that was final action that hurt her.  I don't see why... it's certainly official action.

Would... would the case have to go back to be submitted to the jury under that standard?  What standard did the jury find--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, that isn't the test, I mean, whether you can convince a jury.  I think you... you have to acknowledge that... that before we... we say that these trial instructions were adequate to... to give you your victory, we... we have to find that at least a reasonable jury could conclude under section 703 that... that both of these... both of these adverse actions qualified as discrimination under 703, if... if we're going to use that test.  Right?  You acknowledge that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay, but that... that is at least what... what's before us here, that if... if we go the 703 equals 704 route, we would have to conclude, in order to affirm here, that a reasonable jury could find.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Stris, I'd... I'd like to know what... what you make of our opinion in Barnes v. Alexander.  It's an old case but it involved a situation similar to this, namely, a contingent fee arrangement with a lawyer, and the client received all the money, without giving the lawyer his contingent fee.  We reasoned in our opinion that, quote, the contract for a contingent fee out of a fund awarded constituted a lien upon the fund and that, quote, it is one of the familiar rules in equity that a contract to convey a specific object, even before it is acquired, will make the contractor a trustee as soon as he gets title to the thing.  Why doesn't that absolutely resolve the present case?   Antonin Scalia  But we... but, you know, our opinions haven't said only certain kinds of equitable relief, only restitutionary equitable relief.  We've simply said whether equitable relief would normally be available.  And now you're... you're trying to rewrite our cases to say that only certain types of equitable relief are... are available.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and if, indeed, it does... it does occupy a lot of the field, so be it.  That's the way Congress wrote the statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What... I don't understand what difference that makes.  I mean, in both cases there was a commitment to pay the contingent fee.  It was a promise.  And when the money was collected, the court said, we're going to enforce an equitable lien upon your recovery in order to comply with the promise.   Antonin Scalia  Take it.  It's a good one.  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Why... why isn't that what occurred here?  What... what's the essential difference?   ",05-260X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, but I mean, once you get out of the contract terms and are trying to make your case on the basis of subrogation, you do have to show that... that part of the recovery was... was for the... for the medical expenses.  And has that been shown?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You... you have piqued my curiosity and... and didn't satisfy it.  You say there are variations on make whole.  What... you were about the describe the variations.  What are the variations?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The fact that your equitable claim, you know, traces itself to a contract certainly doesn't... doesn't cause it to cease to be an equitable claim.  I mean, the classic equitable claim is somebody declaring a trust in exchange for some money, and he declares a trust.  Equity will enforce that trust, but the trust is based on a contractual commitment.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  I should think your response is that Congress provided for only equitable relief.   Antonin Scalia  And... and that that's the... that's the answer.   Antonin Scalia  Congress said that.   Antonin Scalia  Or you might try to get ERISA amended.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Presumably such a weak... such a weak claim would not be brought because there--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --there's nothing at the end of it.

0,"Antonin Scalia  When did... when did we first hold that the State had to provide counsel if... if the defendant could not afford his own counsel?   Antonin Scalia  And that's what we generally mean nowadays by the right... by... by the right to counsel.  And when you talk about fairness being its objective, you're talking about the objective of that newly discovered right to have counsel appointed.  But I don't know that fairness was the... was the object of the original right to counsel in the... in the Bill of Rights, which... which only applied to... to your ability to hire your own counsel, and if you couldn't afford counsel, you didn't get one.  I hardly think that... that fairness is the object of that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When... when was our first holding to that effect?   Antonin Scalia  In the '30's.  Gee, that's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that's hardly... that's hardly the original purpose and meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and... and you come here and say that its fundamental purpose is something that is only the purpose of the newly evolved Sixth Amendment and not of the original one.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think that's the overarching goal of the original.  I think it's... it's very fundamental, that if you have funds with which you can hire someone to speak for you, you should be able to use all of your... I mean, your... no.  Your... your freedom is at stake.  You should be able to use all of your money to get the best spokesman for you as possible.  That's the element of fairness that I think is there.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But until the 1930's that element didn't exist.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Until the 1930's, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.   Antonin Scalia  Well, excuse me.  As far as the Constitution is concerned, if you didn't have the money, you didn't have counsel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So he was just disabled from... from his first choice.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The court told him you can't have the counsel you want.  Go find somebody else.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did Flanagan, the case that denied mandamus on this issue... did it assume any resolution of the question whether if... if you can't have counsel of your choice, in order to get your conviction reversed, you have to show... you have to show that the error was not harmless?   Antonin Scalia  No, I understand, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but I would certainly think that it's relevant to the question of whether you allow immediate appeal, what the consequences of not allowing immediate appeal are.  If you're totally deprived of your right, you... you might allow it and--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't... I don't want... I don't want a competent lawyer.  I want a lawyer who's going to get me off.  [Laughter]  I want a lawyer who will invent the Twinkie defense.  I would... I would not... I would not consider the Twinkie defense an invention of a competent lawyer.  But... but I want a lawyer who's going to win for me.  And... and there's no way to predict what lawyer has a charming way with the jury or... or brings in some... some side matters that maybe shouldn't be brought in but the judge is silly enough to let them in.  I want to win.  And... and the criterion for winning is not how competent is the lawyer necessarily.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a fair trial.  Nobody is saying it wasn't a fair trial, but he didn't have the lawyer he wanted.  I mean, we could assure everybody a fair trial by allowing nobody to pick their lawyers and assigning lawyers to everybody.  That would... that would accomplish fair trials throughout the United States, but that's not the system we have.  You're... you're entitled to the lawyer that you want.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you... you could say the... you could say the same thing, counsel, about his right to self representation, that he has the right to self representation for his defense or for his--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Yes, but it is limited to the right of self representation for his defense, just as his choice of counsel is limited to his choice of counsel for his defense.   Antonin Scalia  How do you think that would work with the Twinkie defense?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think any court would conceivably reverse the... the disqualification of counsel on the ground that he would have come up with that defense and win.   ",05-352X

Antonin Scalia  I presume it could lead to lower consumer prices too.  If you have a firm that has developed a new, a new technique for processing the logs, and it can process them cheaper and faster, and sell them for a lower price but in greater volume, and thereby make even more profit, that firm would be willing to pay more for those logs, even though it would sell them for less than competitors might sell them.   Antonin Scalia  What do we do in the correlative situation where there is an allegation of predatory selling rather than predatory buying if you had the same situation posed by Justice Stevens?  Namely evidence that you're trying to drive the competitor out of business, wouldn't that establish a violation?

For example, they say, we're going to try to get a monopoly by buying these logs at a lower price as, at as low a price as possible.

Antonin Scalia  Yes, well, we're talking about administrative law, which is a field I used to know something about, and I've never thought ""exhaustion"" included ""failure to exhaust"", which--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which is--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --what happens when you simply don't file within the prescribed period.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But how does it do that?  I mean, if there's any object that Congress had in mind, surely it was to reduce the number of frivolous prisoner claims that are coming into Federal District Courts.  And it hoped to do this by sending the... making sure that they went through the prison system first.  Whether we looked at what the prison system did or not, we hoped that the prison system would get rid of a large... a large number of these frivolous claims.

""  ""You-- ""   Antonin Scalia  ""# you just sit around until it's too late, file a grievance that you know will not be accepted, because it's too late, and then you can come into Federal Court. ""  This is going to cut back considerably on the number of frivolous claims?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe because they thought they had to file on time.   Antonin Scalia  And the more frivolous the case, the more likely it is that it won't be remembered by a guard.  I mean, you know, the suit is,  ""A guard spat on my painting. ""  or something like that, you know.  Who's going to remember anything like that 4 months later?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me you're understating the amount of time that he's saving by failing to exhaust.  It's not just if he waits six months and then puts it in.  If he had filed within the right period, he would get a hearing at one level.  And there may be as many as two other levels of review before he's fully off... before he's fully exhausted.  Now, here's a guy who... you know, he's lying around in jail.  He's... this is a frivolous filer.  He wants to get out of the jail, downtown, you know, to the District Court in L.A., where he can look at the beautiful people and relieve the humdrum of prison life.

Your question presented it... I'd like to stretch to reach it, but I don't even find it necessarily included within the question presented.  The question presented is whether a defendant corporation and its agents engaged in ordinary, arms length dealings can constitute an enterprise in light of the settled rule that a RICO defendant must conduct or participate in the affairs of some distinct enterprise and not just its own affairs.  It seems to me it's only question two you put before us.   Antonin Scalia  As it is in nine other circuits.   Antonin Scalia  And all circuits against you.

Antonin Scalia  It is logically prior, and I hate to go through all the trouble of figuring out this case if, indeed, corporations are ineligible anyway.  I mean, you know, we're... we're answering a totally hypothetical, nonexistent question.

Your... your discussion with Justice Souter I think indicates how... how hard that is, or some of the examples that the Government brings up, such as a drug company that... that sells drugs illegally, violating the drug laws.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but Reves demonstrates that... that your statement earlier that since it was fraudulent action, it couldn't have been the business of the corporation is simply false.  We... we haven't held that whenever a corporation violates the law, it goes beyond its business, although in a sense it does.  In Reves, we... we said it didn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that, but that's... we have to get into that is my point.

Antonin Scalia  I mean, you... you don't want the... the telephone warrant requirement to... to up the ante on... on what it takes to... for the police to go in without a warrant, do you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it wouldn't be of the essence if you know you have 2 minutes.  I'm going to kill you in 2 minutes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you really want the policeman to say I got 2 minutes, you know, dial in and get a warrant?  That's ridiculous.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Except that there was a front door, which they approached first.  As I recall, they left one of the officers in the front.   Antonin Scalia  So they could have banged on the front door.   Antonin Scalia  Is there, in addition to the safety rationale which you're... justification, which you're arguing here... is there a justification to go in to stop an ongoing felony whether safety is involved or not?   Antonin Scalia  Is... is that a separate--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I mean, you see a guy turning out counterfeit dollar bills, $100 bills, and can you go in right away if you see him doing that?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, but if that's the case, you have a much easier argument.  Wasn't there an assault here?  There was clearly an assault.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  One thing leads to another.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, no.  You... you don't want to say that.  The noise alone wouldn't justify going in without knocking as would the... a scene of a violent event occurring.  Certainly you'd have to knock on the door.  Now, if they didn't hear you and the only way to get their attention to stop the noise is to go in, fine, but wouldn't you have to knock on the door real hard before you went in to stop the noise?   Antonin Scalia  Not appropriate.  Necessary.   Antonin Scalia  I hope so.  I mean... people--   Antonin Scalia  --A good way to put it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Except I... I don't think we look to whether he knew that this was a family reenactment.  I think we look to the facts that he had... that had come to his attention which caused him to believe that this was a family reenactment.  I mean, you know, if he had read it in a newspaper or something else.  The facts are... are what matter and not--   ",05-502X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Studebaker, I'm not sure that even the noise wasn't enough to justify what the police did here.  As... as I recall, they... before they went in, they... they heard all this noise and they saw the punch.  They pushed open the screen door and announced that they were the police.  Okay?   Antonin Scalia  And then only went in when nobody heard them.  Then they shouted even louder, police.  I'm not sure that... that just the noise wouldn't be enough to allow that.  If you can't hear the policeman from the door, who's coming to check about a 3:00 a.m. noisy party, you don't hear his knock on the door, can the policeman not open the door and shout, police?  Is that an unreasonable search and seizure.  And then if you don't hear that, can he take two steps into the house?  He's... he's not looking under the carpets.  He's not looking in the desk drawers.  He's just shouting police so that he can bring to the attention of the people there the fact that there's been a complaint from the neighbors and you have to knock off the noise.  I... I would think that's perfectly reasonable.  Never mind the punch in the nose.   Antonin Scalia  They didn't hear him when he... when he just opened the screen door.  He had to step in a few more... a few more steps.  Then they finally heard him.  That's his... the way I understand these facts.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, he had to raise his voice.  I mean, there was a lot of noise going.  It just seems to me so unreasonable, when a policeman comes to tell people they're making too much noise and the neighbors have complained, that he can't do the minimum that's necessary to get their attention so he can tell them that.  He has to go get a warrant to tell them that the neighbors are complaining about too much noise?  That just seems absurd.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't screaming, police, enough?  I mean, as I understand the facts, he first opened the screen door.  Now, is... is that an entry?  He didn't go in.  I assume the screen door opens out.  Most screen doors open out.  He opened the screen door and shouted, police.  Now, that... that doesn't count?  he has to knock on the screen door instead, even though they're more likely to hear him if he opens the screen door and yells, police?  Why doesn't that meet the requirement?  I... this... why is the trial court obsessed with knocking?  [Laughter]  I don't understand that.   Antonin Scalia  Where is it?   Antonin Scalia  You know, maybe... maybe you're taking our announce and a knock... knock and announce requirement too... too seriously or too literally.  I mean, if a police officer comes up and the door is open, what does he have to do?  Lean over and knock on the side of the door?  Can't he shout, hello, police?  Don't you think that satisfies a knock and announce requirement?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You really think you got to knock even when the door is open.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  And he did that here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He stood at the door.  He opened the screen door and said, police--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which he thought would be more effective than knocking on... on the... you know, the... the edge of a screen door, which doesn't make a very good knock.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",05-502X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Where--   Antonin Scalia  --Where are those sections?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  What are the sections... (b)?   Antonin Scalia  All right.   Antonin Scalia  We have a case involving standing which says that... you know, the doctrine of standing is more than a... an exercise in the... in the conceivable.  And this seems to me an exercise in the conceivable.  Nobody thinks your client is really, you know, abstaining from tequila down in Mexico because he's on supervised release in the United States, or is going... is going to apply... having been deported from the country for criminal offenses, is going to apply to come back in the... these are ingenious exercises in the conceivable.  This is just not the real world.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That depends on whether you consider the sentence to be effectively expired once he leaves the country, if the sentence is one of supervised release, which is impossible once he leaves the country.  Supervision being impossible, supervised release is not a realistic consequence of the prior conviction.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think there's a realistic possibility that this person is going to be readmitted?  A realistic possibility?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think there's a realistic possibility he's going to try to get readmitted, so that he can be subjected to really enforced supervised release?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Has he applied for such a visa?  Has he expressed any intention to apply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --then it's an exercise in the conceivable, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any indication that that's in the works, or is this just another conceivable thing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING ",05-547X
0,"Antonin Scalia  I thought the Government has taken the position... and as far as I know, all the Courts of Appeals have bought the Government's argument... that there... you do not need a conviction--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that so--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.  You don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Yes, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but 924(c) is incorporated in 1101(a)(43).  It's--   Antonin Scalia  --incorporated.  So, you want us to interpret 924(c) one way for criminal convictions... a criminal sentence... that is, you don't need a conviction in order to get the enhancement... but another way for--   Antonin Scalia  --for the INA?   Antonin Scalia  Why is--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but you don't... you don't look to the jurisdiction of conviction.  Are you telling me you require a conviction?  You... I thought you told me you don't require a conviction.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kneedler, could--   Antonin Scalia  --Sure.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kneedler, could I ask you about your assertion that you  ""look to the State of conviction? ""  What do you mean by that?  For purposes of 1101.  Does that mean, if you're convicted, in State court, of a misdemeanor... and even though that action would be a Federal felony, it's not an aggravated felony?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, it's sort of a double inconsistency.  Not only do you treat State... State actions that are... that are minimal... I'm sorry, where the State treats it more seriously than the Federal Government, not only do you follow the State, but, where the State treats it less leniently than the Federal Government, you also follow the State.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, you look to the State of conviction.  What--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That's for purposes of the immigration law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Now, do you do the same for purposes of the felony enhancement provision?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, that seems to me--   Antonin Scalia  --very strange.  You would look to the... you would look to the State law for purposes of the immigration section; but, for purposes of 924(c), what would you look to?  Either one.  Whichever--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --whichever... for 924... whichever one would make it a felony.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You lose.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it's a felony under either one, for purposes of 924(c), you lose, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If the act is either a State felony or a Federal felony, you lose.  I mean, the defendant gets the enhanced sentence, right, under 924(c)?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Listen.   Antonin Scalia  Listen.  My question is a simple one.  If it's... it seems to me, if it's... what you're saying is, if it is either a felony under Federal law or a felony under State law, you get the enhanced sentence under 924(c), isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought that's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --what the whole argument is about, whether it has to be a felony under Federal law.  You're telling me, if it's a misdemeanor under Federal law, that you don't get--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the enhanced sentence?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You've thoroughly confused me now.   Antonin Scalia  Never mind sentencing, let's get back to the immigration.  If I understand what you're now saying, if you're convicted in State Court of action that is a Federal felony, but it's just a State misdemeanor... right +/?  you look to the State of conviction, and it would be a misdemeanor, and the immigration provisions would not... would not take effect.

Antonin Scalia  I assume that's how we got to Teague.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I assume there would be a Rule 60(b) motion or the equivalent of it in state court.  If indeed our law had changed; don't you think?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's inconceivable that the problem wouldn't be solved in some fashion by the state court that rendered the decision.   Antonin Scalia  You're saying not just ""clearly""; ""then clearly established law"".   Antonin Scalia  That is, at the time of the state court decision.   Antonin Scalia  Exactly.  But you know, how you play the game depends upon at what level of generality you describe the right.  And I agree with you if you describe the right as the right to cross-examination, that... that was... reinstituted by Crawford, which said that the confrontation right is a right to confrontation... to cross-examination, which didn't exist before.  I mean, you could dispense with that right of cross-examination if there were indicia of reliability.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure that you can so... in such a facile fashion decide what is a bedrock principle.  Frankly, I don't know any formula that would... that would describe it.  I really think it is a... you know it when you see it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It is like obscenity.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that the case in Federal courts, too?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, it is conceivable that Federal courts would interpret the hearsay rule to require precisely that anyway.

We said that it was the view of the framers of the Constitution that cross-examination, confrontation in that sense, was necessary for greater accuracy.  Now in our evaluation of what constitutes a landmark decision, are we bound to the framers' view of things?  I mean, you know, maybe... I'm not sure that if you apply a proper interpretation of indicia of reliability under Roberts, I'm really not sure whether it wouldn't be more accurate than confrontation, but that wouldn't matter to me, because confrontation is what the Constitution required and what the framers thought were necessary.  Am I bound, for purposes of the rule we're arguing about here, to what the framers think?   Antonin Scalia  I think that discussion of the, you know, the contrary decisions that had been produced under Roberts was just for the purpose of justifying the overruling of a case that... you know... that was not that old.  It hadn't worked out as well as we maybe expected it would.  But I don't think it was for the purpose of showing that it always produces unreliable results.   INTERRUPTING ",05-595X

""   Antonin Scalia  Is it... is it unlawful to agree to pay somebody money who does not have a patent?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you're speaking as though somehow that... such a contract is contrary to public policy, and void.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Contractually?  They say that that's their contractual right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where does that appear in the licensing agreement?  Or--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, I took them as just asserting a general proposition of law... that, where they've agreed to pay royalties because of a patent, if the patent is invalid, they don't have to pay royalties... not because there's some special provision in this contract.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, there's really not much at issue in this case.  And that's clearly a case of controversy, isn't it?  There is a dispute over the meaning of that provision of the agreement.   Antonin Scalia  Gee, there's less here than meets the eye.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And what would their... what would their concrete injury be?  What is the threatened imminent injury that they would assert in that... in that action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have a licensee who's paying the license fees.  What is their concrete injury?   Antonin Scalia  But--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --so long as they're still paying the royalties, isn't that sort of an abstract disagreement?

Antonin Scalia  You contend that what commenced the action here was the order demanding payment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a very weird commencement of an action, where what then follows is what is referred to as an ""appeal"", within the agency.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which says that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What page of your brief?   Antonin Scalia  Of the reply.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not finding it.  Where is it, again?   Antonin Scalia  Why is... why doesn't it make much more sense... as I understand the proceeding, this order doesn't come out of the blue.  As required, there has to be a letter to the... to the payee saying,  ""We think... we think you owe so much money. ""  He is allowed to respond, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And then, after considering the response, the order issues.  Now, I would consider that a... you know, an... that sounds to me like a complaint and an opportunity to respond to it.  And then, finally, the first decision of the agency, which is then appealed... and CFR provides for an... what he calls an appeal.  And it seems to me the final opinion of the agency is the opinion on the appeal.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it doesn't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --waive it, but it can't issue the order without having issued the letter first, giving--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --giving the party an opportunity to say why this amount isn't owed.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't... you don't... but you don't respond to the order; you take an appeal from the order.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me crazy to call that order a complaint.  I... even if I grant your other argument, that an administrative proceeding can be commenced by a complaint... or that the term ""complaint"" can apply to administrative proceedings, I don't think that what you've hung your hat on here... namely, the order... seems to me to fit that description.   Antonin Scalia  I doubt whether--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that would--   Antonin Scalia  --I doubt whether that would conform with the Administrative Procedure Act.  I mean, either... even at the first level of agency decision--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --it seems to me you have to give the individual an opportunity to reply.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course you can ignore it.  That doesn't prove anything.  You could ignore an agency complaint, too--   Antonin Scalia  --I mean, a formal complaint, in which case you'll be found liable.  What does--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the fact that you don't have to respond have to do with anything?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you--   Antonin Scalia  --you'd win in this case even if it did.  I don't think that the difference between the initial letter giving you an opportunity to reply, and the... what you call the ""complaint"", the order... that time period doesn't put you out of... out of the permissible period.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, 2415(a), (i), we... you, you cannot possibly say that that only applies to judicial actions, can you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's in--   Antonin Scalia  --and that's in title 28.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  What--   Antonin Scalia  --They could have said... if the other interpretation of 2415(a), as not applying to administrative proceedings, were correct, they could have said the provisions of this section do not apply to administrative proceedings--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which would have... which would have handled the offset--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but would have been well beyond the offset.  And the fact--   Antonin Scalia  --that they only focus on the offset certainly suggests that when you're not talking about offset, it does apply to administrative proceedings.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can believe that they do--   Antonin Scalia  --I can... I can believe that they do that.  [Laughter]  But--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --By mistake.  But I would not assume a mistake unless it's very clear.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's true.  That's true.  But the provision you're arguing that you come under does talk about a complaint.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's what... you know, that's what starts the 6 years running.  And it's... seems to me odd to call something a ""complaint"" which is, in fact, an order.  They're not complaining about anything; they're saying, ""Pay the money"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You know, usually a complaint, you're... you make your point, and say,  ""What do you say? ""  ""What's your answer? ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And this is an order.  You're... boom, ""Pay"".   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's only true if you consider an appeal to be the response.  And that's rather weird, that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that the response to a complaint is an appeal.   Antonin Scalia  Could you get us... we're going to have supplemental material filed, the OLC opinion.  Could you... could you get us a... you know, a sample of an agency letter?

1,"Antonin Scalia  It often does.  But it does not, universally.  And there are a number of instances cited by the Petitioner that... where this Court and... and statutes use the term in context where it clearly applies to administrative proceedings.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, the question is, How... you know, how absurd is it not to read it to apply to administrative proceedings in this case?  And I find it pretty absurd, because you assume, if you read that it way, that there is effectively no statute of limitations whatever for the Government in these cases.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wait.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  And this was the Congress that enacted what?   Antonin Scalia  Oh.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which is not what we're talking about here.   Antonin Scalia  As late as 1978, the Justice Department didn't think that way, did it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel, in '78, was exactly what the Petitioner here would urge.   Antonin Scalia  But... excuse me... how could OLC possibly think that it applied to administrative offsets if it didn't apply to administrative proceedings?  I mean, it was a contradiction of the proposition, which you're urging here, which is that this statute applies only to judicial proceedings.  I mean, that's the point.  Whether they spoke just to offsets or not, the position taken by the Justice Department was that this statute relates to administrative proceedings.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do we have--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that opinion, by the way?  Both sides cited it.  The... is it... it was unpublished.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does anybody give it to us?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, I know they did offer, but nobody did it.   Antonin Scalia  Good.  I would like that.   Antonin Scalia  How about the initial letter that, in the agency practice, precedes the order?  I gather there's a letter to the--   Antonin Scalia  An issue letter.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Sounds to me like a complaint, a response--   Antonin Scalia  --and an adjudication.  I mean, you know--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --""We think you owe this"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The response comes back,  ""I don't think we owe it, and here's why. ""  And then there's a ruling, ""You do owe it"".  And that's the order.  And then you can appeal it.  And the CFR refers to it as an appeal.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It does not--   Antonin Scalia  --assert that there's a discrepancy?   Antonin Scalia  Do we have an example of issue letters anywhere?  That's not in the materials either, is it?  In the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think so.  I tried to figure that out.  I think--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I think--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Okay.   Antonin Scalia  How do you defend against a claim for, you know, stuff that went on a hundred years ago?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I... I'm really very reluctant to... unless there is no possible other reading of the statute, to think that that's... that that's what the law provides, that the Government can show up a hundred years later, and say,  ""Oh, by the way, you owe all this money. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The company says  ""Gee, I... you know, I don't have records from a hundred years ago. ""   Antonin Scalia  Say that again.  Until 1966, there were no statute of limitations against any Government suits?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He didn't apply against the Government either.   Antonin Scalia  That's another indication.  Why would you allow them to destroy those records after 6 years if you... if you thought... if you thought that there was no statute of limitations to claims for these things?  I mean, that's just another inconsistency that... in the statutory scheme that's created.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You say,  ""You can destroy your records after 6 years. ""  Well, why?  It doesn't make any sense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Well, except when you... when you say 2415(a) and you leave out (i), which... or I guess it's ""one"".  Is it?  Little... or--   Antonin Scalia  --It's (i).  I mean, that clearly does apply to administrative proceedings.  And I could understand the argument that Congress was just making things doubly clear... okay +/?  that (a) does not apply to administrative proceedings.  I could understand that argument if the way (i) was written is,  ""The provisions of this section shall not apply to administrative proceedings.

I don't do it bite by bite; you look at the whole text... and, when you read all this stuff together, it seems to me that the import of (i) is that administrative proceedings, despite the fact that ""action"" is not a very common word to use for them, are covered.   Antonin Scalia  That's the best thing you have going for you, really, the strict construction canon.

Antonin Scalia  So they are an interpretation of the statutory language in 201.   Antonin Scalia  And you say this one is not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You say it would be a reasonable practice not to pay the money, but for the existence of the regulation.   Antonin Scalia  Before you go back, let's hear about the accounting rules.  What would they be issued under?  Would they be issued under 201?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me accounting rules... in order to decide what is just and reasonable, you have to have accounting rules.  So the accounting rules fit very comfortably under 201.   INTERRUPTING ",05-705X
0,"Antonin Scalia  What can't... what can't be--  sucked in under section 201?  I mean, once the FCC issues a regulation, it's easy to say that any violation of that regulation is unjust.  And that's what's happened here.  And this just makes a farce of the provision that says the only private causes of action are for violations of the statute and not for violations of the regulation.  It seems to me if this thing, 276, can get sucked into 201 simply by reason of the fact that failing to obey an FCC regulation is unjust, that provision is a nullity.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I'm saying you'd have to argue that if the theory you're propounding for this case is correct.  Violation of an FCC regulation is unjust.  Failing to comply with an FCC regulation is unjust.   Antonin Scalia  So can... every FCC regulation can be enforceable by private action?  All the FCC has to say is that violation of this regulation is unjust.   Antonin Scalia  No?   Antonin Scalia  But at least... at least any FCC regulations relating to charges, practices... and you want to interpret practices very broadly... classifications, and regulations for and in connection with communication service, all of those regulations can be sued upon in Federal court with all the diverse and contradictory rulings that that will produce, so long as the FCC says that the failure to obey this regulation is, in our view, unjust.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think he's saying that.  I don't think he's saying that if it is covered under regulation, it can't be unjust.  Some regulations do relate to justness and reasonableness, but not 276.  I think what he's saying is 276 established a scheme.  It didn't have to be this scheme.  It could have been some other scheme.  Nothing in the nature of things says that the long distance carrier has to be the one liable for this.  It rather was simply imposed by the FCC.  That's fine.  But to say that it would be unjust for them not to do that is just unreal, unless you're going to allow any violation of any FCC regulation to be unjust.   Antonin Scalia  But the rate regulation is... is established in order to determine what reasonableness and justness requires.  And 276 is something quite different.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but wait.  Wait.  It says to furnish such communications service, is what (a) says.  And they don't furnish such communications service to your client.

And once we do that, if 208 governs this thing, then so does 206.   Antonin Scalia  I thought you should be.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but they're certainly entitled to deference as to whether an administrative action can be brought under 208.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once you say that it can, then a court action can be brought under 206.   Antonin Scalia  So you think we don't owe them deference for 206, but we do for 208.

1,"Antonin Scalia  To apply an opinion of this Court to particular circumstances, and find that in the view of the court of appeals, it produces a certain result is not necessarily to say that that is clearly established Supreme Court law.  It just means that it is their best guess as to how it comes out, right?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, they're forced to decide it one way or the other, the Supreme Court opinion either means this or that.  They're not applying a clearly established test to the Supreme Court, are they?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you also don't allow people to come into most courtrooms in tank shirts, and we don't allow people to, you know, to wear beany hats.  Everything that is inappropriate for a courtroom is not necessarily inappropriate because it would prejudice the--  trial; isn't that right?   Antonin Scalia  Maybe that's why we don't allow banners, because a courtroom is not the place for banners.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I wish you hadn't said that.  Because I had thought that one of the things that made this case leaning in your direction is the fact that merely having a picture of their loved one on the button doesn't convey the message, you know, hang the defendant, or even convict the defendant.  It just conveys, at most, to the jury, you know, this is... we have been deprived of someone we love, you should take this matter very seriously and consider the case carefully.  It is an important matter to us.  And therefore, you ought to deliberate carefully.  I don't know that it means anything more than that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You said, you know, convict what's... or hang What's His Name.  That's quite... you're equating that with the buttons in this case.  And I don't think the buttons in this case say hang so and so, or even convict so and so.  They just say we have been deprived of a loved one.  This is a terrible matter.  Please, jury, consider this case carefully.  That's all it necessarily says.   Antonin Scalia  I thought some states require that the relatives of the victim be allowed to make their case to the jury for harsh penalty.

Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but there is a First Amendment problem when you're dealing with activities of people other than the prosecution, people other than the state, who is bringing this prosecution.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure, it may come out the way... it may come out the way you want, but it's hard to say that the Supreme Court, any Supreme Court case bears upon it, when we haven't had a case that involves weighing the First Amendment right of the people in the courtroom to wear buttons or cry or--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, but that cuts against you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let's assume... risk of what?  That's what I'm puzzled by.  Let's assume that the buttons were big enough that they could recognize that the buttons were the face of the deceased for whose murder the trial was about.  Let's assume all that.  What risk is that?  You know, during sentencing I can understand, oh, he caused so much grief to so many people, once we found him guilty, we should sock him with a stiff sentence.  But during the guilt trial?  I mean, I see, gee, the victim's family loved him a lot.  This guy must be guilty.  That doesn't follow at all.  In the guilt phase, I don't see how that can have any effect on the jury.   Antonin Scalia  I don't see the possibility.  You tell me that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Is there a real possibility that a jury is going to say, since this man's... this victim's family loved him so much, this guy must be guilty?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's just because we haven't had a First Amendment case yet.  I mean, we just have parties arguing in the context of the criminal trial for the defendant, for the state.  Let's wait until the ACLU brings a case about people who want to wear buttons in court.  Then you're going to have people arguing, people ought to be able to wear buttons, just as they can wear a shirt that says ""Blip the Draft"".   ",05-785X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Was deadly weapon still an enhancement at that point, or was deadly weapon part of the definition of a new crime?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you... you could... it could be argued that it not only didn't encompass the firearm finding, but it excluded the firearm finding.  If, as you tell us, there are two categories, one being deadly weapon, which does not include firearm, and the other being firearm, wouldn't you say that the jury verdict positively contradicted?   Antonin Scalia  The judge doesn't have to find it beyond a reasonable doubt, does he?   Patricia A. Millett  --Exactly.  Exactly, Justice Scalia.  There's not only... there may be disputed evidence, but the standard may be different.  It's not clear whether it was here, but at least as to some factors.  It's clearly not enough that there's sufficient evidence to support the judge's determination.  The question would be whether there's any... a jury could have found any doubt or when it's clear beyond a reasonable doubt, that the outcome would have been the same.  But I do think in a case like this, it's important to keep in mind that it's... this case illustrates that these things are not categorically or necessarily unamenable to harmless error review.  And in fact, what would happen in cases like this and a lot in the Federal system, where you have undisputed, uncontested facts... and we know that because they had the incentive to contest them at a sentencing proceeding.  And so to hold that automatic reversal is required would mean it would go back for a retrial that would have nothing to do... nothing to do with the element that was not decided by the jury.  That would be undisputed.  There's not going to be any contest back here that the firearm, the semi automatic that was handed to the jury loaded and passed around to the jury, was a firearm.  It would just be a second bite at the apple to contest things that were decided properly and beyond a reasonable doubt by the jury, consistent with the defendant's constitutional rights.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand what... what you meant by a facial unconstitutional... facially unconstitutional problem.  You mean a Federal court would enjoin the criminal prosecution because it's unconstitutional on its face?  We wouldn't say that, would we?   Patricia A. Millett  I can't imagine the Federal court would intervene in an ongoing State proceeding.   Antonin Scalia  Neither can I.   Patricia A. Millett  But State courts are perfectly capable of... of applying and we assume that they would apply and adhere to constitutional law from this Court.   Antonin Scalia  So that... that's not really an adequate answer, that it would facially unconstitutional.   Patricia A. Millett  Well, my understanding was that the Washington law... Washington legislature didn't amend its law to say that this could be submitted to a jury.  And then every defendant at the outset of the case, would say you need to, you know, strike the indictment, dismiss this charge--   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Whisman, can I... can I ask you a hypothetical which I think puts in starker form what the... what your colleague here says this case involves?  Suppose that... that you have a statute, a murder statute, which applies the murder of a single individual, but... but you have another statute with a death penalty called aggravated murder.  And it's a different crime and it... it requires the... the killing of more than one person in... in the same... in the same event.  Let's assume a trial in which somebody came into a bank with a machine gun.  Only one person came in, and five people were killed.  But the prosecution only brought a prosecution for simple murder.  Okay?  And the jury comes back with a verdict for... for simple murder.  Certainly a judge would not be able to say, well, no jury could possibly have found simple murder here without also thinking that this person was guilty of... of this greater offense of... of aggravated murder and, therefore, I'm going to enter a judgment of aggravated murder.  That's what the... the defense says happened here, that there was just a verdict of... of the lesser offense.  That's all the jury found.  It could have found more and maybe... maybe in finding that, it... it must have thought that the greater offense also existed, but it never came in with a verdict for the greater offense.

1,"Antonin Scalia  It is a little of an exaggeration, though, to say that EPA has since the issuance of the regulations always interpreted them the way that you prefer.  In fact, the director of the PSD program gave two opinions in which he took precisely the interpretation that opposing counsel took.   Antonin Scalia  Rightly so, I think.  I mean, it was the earliest, application of the regulation by the officer of the agency specifically in charge of the program.   Antonin Scalia  Well, whatever the reason he gave, was it... these opinions were out there when the challenge to the regulations, in which Duke did not participate, when that challenge was brought, were these... were those opinions already out there?   Antonin Scalia  I understand that, and I think you may have the better of the argument on me on the interpretation of the PSD regulations.  But what I am concerned about is that companies can get whipsawed.  They don't challenge the regulations when they come out because as far as they know, the agency is interpreting them in a way that they favor.  And then some years later, when it turns out the agency is using a different interpretation, you have the jurisdictional bar.   Antonin Scalia  We've wrestled with these things for several days.  It's disappointing to hear you tell us they're clear.   Antonin Scalia  Right.  In deciding whether the regulations are reasonable, however, is it proper for a court to take into account that the regulations must follow the prescription of the statute that the PSD definition be the same as the NSPS... what is it... NSPS definition?  I mean, that's a usual tool of statutory... or regulatory construction.  Cannot a court give great weight to that in interpreting these ambiguous regulations?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't think the same argument has necessarily to be made, but the question still before us is how you interpret the regulations.  Let's assume that's just a regulatory interpretation question, it's not a statutory question.   Antonin Scalia  But in deciding that, whatever was argued in prior cases, it seems to me that we're entitled to take into account the necessity that the regulations comply with the statute.  And if they are ambiguous, we should resolve the ambiguity in the direction that it seems to us would provide consistency with the statute.  Now does that violate the jurisdictional bar?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Why was that rejection wrong?  Because this issue is still important to me for purposes of statutory construction.  Is it conceivable that when Congress says the word widget in this statute has to mean the same as the word widget in the other statute, that the agency can effectively frustrate the apparent Congressional intent by saying, oh, yes, I mean, yes, that has to mean the same thing, but we can adopt regulations under one statute which regulations say it means one thing, and we can adopt regulations under another statute that says it means something else.  I mean, to say that they have to mean the same thing it seems to me means that the regulations have to say they mean the same thing.   Antonin Scalia  Of course it does, but when Congress says the definition in the two statutes has to be the same, whatever choice the agency makes among those options has to be applied to both, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  Well, then it's meaningless to say the definition has to be the same.   Antonin Scalia  Entirely meaningless.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Hungar, I'm curious.  What happens if you have a new company that wasn't around when the regulation was issued?  Can it... can it bring a challenge to the conformity of the regulation to the statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, a nice question.  I mean, all you have to do is find a stalking horse.  Just have some new company carry your water for you.   Antonin Scalia  Who was saying that?   Antonin Scalia  That's the NSPS section.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They say that that provision only applies when there is no SIP.  And that's not this case.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  It seems to me each part has had different definitions and this definition only applies to part 52 which applies when there is no SIP.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know how you can say it automatically applies when there is a SIP.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Part 51, in other words.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Phillips, before you get away from this section 52, because I think that is the best section for your case, 52.01(d), is there, is there any sensible reason why you would want to have a different definition of modification for non-SIP situations than you would for SIP situations?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That occurred to me when--   Antonin Scalia  --You're quoting page 9?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, in their reply brief?   Antonin Scalia  It's definitely no.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think what's wrong with it is that you could have achieved that same result by simply not saying that modification in one program has to mean the same as modification in the other.  If you didn't say that, that would be the result.  You give modification whatever meaning you think is reasonable here.  You give it whatever reading you think is reasonable in the other place.  But when you say the two have to be the same, it seems to me you have something else in mind.   Antonin Scalia  It's not just a matter of using the same word.   Antonin Scalia  It's a matter of a statute which says it shall have the same meaning.   Antonin Scalia  --to the PSD?   ",05-848X

I mean, if in every case you're going to be able to appeal whether indeed there was lack of jurisdiction, you're going to be able to appeal every case.   Antonin Scalia  That would be fine if 1447(d) said that there is no appeal so long as the basis for removal was proper, but that's not what it says.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you're into your backup argument now.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The backup argument that you're now making, that not your principal argument.   Antonin Scalia  They don't care whether it had subject matter jurisdiction or not.  It's not an essential part of their case.  Their case is even if it did, it mistakenly thought it didn't, and remand it, end of case.   Antonin Scalia  That's their backup argument, I think.   Antonin Scalia  It's... it's the same with diversity jurisdiction.  You can make the same argument.  There's nothing distinctive here.  This statute says that in a foreign sovereign immunity case you have a right to be tried in Federal court.  Fine.  But the statute also says that if you're a defendant in a diversity suit, you have a right to trial in federal court.  And I don't know why this is any more demanding of an exception to 1447(d) than is ordinary diversity jurisdiction, where Congress has said you're entitled to trial in federal court.   Antonin Scalia  How is that relevant here?  Where is the post-removal event?     The post-removal event here is the recognition of the defendant's sovereign immunity.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's not an event.  That's... that's an epiphany, it's not an event.  [Laughter]     Well, according... well, apparently the district court viewed it as a post-removal event that deprived it, or defeated, divested--   Antonin Scalia  Very strange meaning of event.     --Well, I... Your Honor--   Antonin Scalia  I mean the sovereign immunity didn't exist from the outset.  Nothing changed.     --But... but the district court's order is clear.  And it is absolutely correct in this regard that removal jurisdiction existed at the outset.  So the court does not lack removal jurisdiction.  The reference in 1447(c), second sentence to ""lacks subject matter jurisdiction"", refers to lacks removal jurisdiction.  And in fact, this Court used that shorthand repeatedly in the Kircher decision to describe 1447(c), lacks removal jurisdiction.  This Court--   Antonin Scalia  When did it say that?  I really find it very hard to accept that argument, when its says... you know... it doesn't use lacks removal jurisdiction, that's what it means.  It is such an easy thing to say.     --Well, the Court has to go back to the history of the statute, how it's evolved.  Clearly pre-1998, authority to remand was only if it was removed without jurisdiction.  And so the question is when Congress changed the language to lacks subject matter jurisdiction, did it mean lacks removal jurisdiction?  Which it--   ",05-85XX

Antonin Scalia  No, I understand.  But I'm trying to find what, you know, the outer limits of your contentions are.  It doesn't seem to me that your briefs indicated that you would object to something like magnet schools.  The... even if one of the purposes of those schools is to try to cause more white students to go to schools that are predominantly nonwhite.  It's just voluntary, I mean, but the object is to achieve a greater racial mix.   Antonin Scalia  I understand.   Antonin Scalia  Why do you agree that this is not an affirmative action case?  Is it not?  Wherein does it differ?  I thought that the school district was selecting some people because they wanted a certain racial mix in the schools, and were taking the affirmative action of giving a preference to students of a certain race.  Why isn't... why doesn't that qualify as affirmative action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't know what else it is.  What do you think it is that causes you to seemingly accept the characterization that this is not it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought there was a criterion here, and that is, you can go to whatever school you want.  You are allowed to go to a certain choice of school.  The criterion was your choice.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course they're not.  That's why some of them were oversubscribed.  That's why others were undersubscribed.   Antonin Scalia  General Clement, is there anything unconstitutional about desiring a mingling of the races and establishing policies which achieve that result but which do not single out individuals and disqualify them for certain things because of their race?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Madden, that's certainly an admirable goal.  Could a local unit, a municipality, or even a State have another goal?  Let's say what used to be great about the United States was the presence of various ethnic groups.  I mean, there were the Pennsylvania Dutch, there were the Amish, there were Little Italys, there were Chinatowns, and these things are beginning to disappear.  And we think that we should encourage the continuation of that diversity, as the Federal Government has done with respect to American Indian tribes.  And therefore, we're going to use public funds for such things as street festivals, a Chinatown street festival, an Italian street festival.  We're going to encourage those organizations that maintain that separateness.  Is there anything unconstitutional about that objective?   Antonin Scalia  About the objective?  I mean, think we should foster separateness?  Is there anything wrong--   Antonin Scalia  --Fine... it would be problematic?   Antonin Scalia  Why?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Please let me finish the line of questioning.  Assume with me that it is not an unconstitutional objective, which I am sure it's not.  Could the... could the government achieve that objective by barring people from moving into Little Italy or giving a preference to some people to buy real estate in Little Italy if they are of Italian ancestry?  Could it do that?  Absolutely not, right?   Antonin Scalia  So it would appear that even if the objective is okay, you cannot achieve it by any means whatever.  And the mere fact that the objective of achieving a diverse balanced society is perfectly all right, although certainly not the only objective in the world.  The mere fact that it's okay doesn't mean you can achieve it by any means whatever?   Antonin Scalia  Do you have quotas for, for racial hiring of your faculty in these schools?   Antonin Scalia  Why not?   Antonin Scalia  To say segregated, segregated... you refer to some of the schools as segregated.  And I, that's not what I understand by segregated.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you know, if you belong to a country club that, that... that has 15 percent black members, I would not consider that a segregated country club.  So what you are complaining about is, is not segregation in any, in any reasonable sense of the word.  You're complaining about a lack of racial balance.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's the only meaning of segregation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're talking about racial balance.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think you're also--   Antonin Scalia  --What criteria of race does the school, just out of curiosity, does the school district use?  I mean, what if a particular child's grandfather was white?  Would he qualify as a white or nonwhite.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, there must be some criterion.  There are many people of mixed blood.   Antonin Scalia  It allows parents to say--  I'm white, no matter what?   Antonin Scalia  Seems like a big loophole.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it seems to me you're saying you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.  Can you think of any area of the law in which we say whatever it takes, so long as there's a real need, whatever it takes... I mean, if we have a lot of crime out there and the only way to get rid of it is to use warrantless searches, you know, fudge on some of the protections of the Bill of Rights, whatever it takes, we've got to do it?  Is there any area of the law that doesn't have some absolute restrictions?   Antonin Scalia  But what about the Fourteenth?  I thought that was one of the absolute restrictions, that you cannot judge and classify people on the basis of their race.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What other possible relief could they seek other than giving them a procedural right accorded by the Act?  What other possible relief could they seek that they would not be seeking as guardians of the child?   Antonin Scalia  It depends upon their being a party aggrieved.  That is defined in Black's Law Dictionary as a party entitled to a remedy.

Counsel, who are referred to as officers of the court, protect the court from frivolous suits, from suits that really have no basis.  When we give that authority to appear in court and initiate a suit to the public at large, we make a lot more work for Federal district judges.  Why should we interpret this statute to achieve that unusual result?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  These disadvantaged parents that you are referring to who comprise the majority of parents, they're really up on section, you know, (h)(1) and all that stuff?  I find that hard to believe.  I mean, the people you're assertedly benefiting here are the people least likely to have familiarized themselves with the statute and the procedures.   Antonin Scalia  And do it right after reading pro se prisoner petitions, right?  You'd have a nice evening's work.   Antonin Scalia  I think you quoted from 4(a).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then you still haven't said anything.  I thought you were saying that they can sue for the money and they can sue for denied procedures.  But if all the procedures are given and they're still not satisfied with the public education that is given, they would not be able to sue claiming--  that it was inadequate under the terms of the Act.  You think they can sue then, too, as well.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you haven't said anything then.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You really haven't limited the scope of the parent's right to sue at all.   Antonin Scalia  Fine.  You've given the procedure but where does the Act guarantee the parents the proper outcome?  The proper... assignment?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It does give the parents the right procedures explicitly and the rights to reimbursement for... for private tuition.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that right, where... where is that right contained?  You have given us citations for the other ones.  Where is that right contained?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The right to initiate a suit solely on the basis... not that I was denied procedures, not that I, I paid money for private schooling, but I do not believe the outcome, the education given to my child in the public school was enough.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They have the right... they have the right to the hearing.  But do they have the right--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Do they have a right in and of themselves... not as guardians... do they have the right to a particular outcome in the hearing?  That's, that's the point I'm inquiring to.   ",05-983X

Antonin Scalia  What if... what stands in the way of that analysis is the text, which says all other rights accorded to parents under this subchapter transfer to the child.  Not only doesn't that help you, it seems to me it hurts you.  It acknowledges that there are rights accorded to parents.   Antonin Scalia  But then you were denying them, as I understood the argument.   Antonin Scalia  What was the section you cited?   Antonin Scalia  (e)(3)(E).   Antonin Scalia  Legal fees.  The disbursements under subparagraph (d) shall not support legal fees, court costs, or other costs associated with the cause of action brought on behalf of a child with a disability to ensure a free and appropriate public--  education for such child.

1,"Antonin Scalia  They're not at issue as far as this mootness question goes.  I mean, you're seeking to have the right to file under 13.  And if, in fact, there's no eligibility to file under 13, you're asking for the impossible.  The case is simply... you know... it's just air.  So I guess, perhaps you rely on the fact that the case is still on appeal.  Should we not take as a given that there is a judgment that you don't qualify for 13, and yet you're coming before us asking us to say that you can apply under Chapter 13.  It doesn't make any sense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, didn't you make that argument to the bankruptcy court that found that you were not eligible?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what I'm asking.  A Chapter 7 debtor doesn't, but a Chapter 13 debtor presumably does.  So didn't you make the same argument to the bankruptcy court.   Antonin Scalia  And they rejected it?   Antonin Scalia  I don't care about the present case.  I care about the Chapter 13 case in which you have been found not to qualify for Chapter 13 treatment.  Didn't you make before that court the same argument you're making now that some of the debts shouldn't be counted.   Antonin Scalia  They rejected it, right?   Antonin Scalia  And they rejected it?   Antonin Scalia  But you said it was only a Chapter 7 debtor who couldn't object.   Antonin Scalia  But you are applying under Chapter 13.   Antonin Scalia  Didn't you object to that and say you should look at these claims afresh?   Antonin Scalia  And what did the court say?  Did it say it had to or that it did so and still found them over the limit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What did the bankruptcy court say?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  But did it reduce it to a level that you qualified for Chapter 13 treatment?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course you are.  They've rendered a decision.  How could you not be finished with the claims objection process if the bankruptcy court has rendered a final decision.   Antonin Scalia  It is terribly confusing.  It seems to me that the Chapter 13 bankruptcy court had the responsibility for determining whether you qualified under the, you know, under the amount of debt.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you objected to that, I gather?   Antonin Scalia  You objected to that, to that ruling?   Antonin Scalia  Mr.... Mr. Baker, I have... I have a question on a matter that really upsets me and causes me to wonder how, you know, how much we can rely upon your description here.  You claimed in the petition that the reason your client filed under Chapter 7 rather than 13 was that he was unemployed at the time.  And that he decided to go to 13 after he became employed.  Yet, on... as shown in the supplemental appendix, when he filed under Chapter 7, under penalty of perjury, he said that he was employed, and at the meeting of the creditors, he confirmed under oath that he was employed.  What was it?  Was he employed or not employed?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It says employment, occupation, name of employer: Capital Carpet and Flooring.  How long employed, five months.  Address of employment: Woburn, Massachusetts.  It also says the same thing on page 18 of the supplemental appendix.  And also with the meeting of creditors.  If you look at the joint appendix at 64a, he says the same thing that he was employed.  Was he employed or not employed?   Antonin Scalia  Does he go around swearing he was when he wasn't?   Antonin Scalia  Look on page 64a of the appendix, the meeting of creditors.  Trustee says okay, and you now work for another entity, Capital Carpet and Flooring, sir?  And Mark Marrama says yes.   Antonin Scalia  Does the government have any position on the mootness question here?   Lisa S. Blatt  Well, our position is that it's not moot because it's on appeal.  If that decision is affirmed, it would in a sense practically be moot because there would be an alternative grounds and the debtor wouldn't be eligible under Chapter 13 in any event.  But we didn't see that as necessarily an Article III mootness problem.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure I understood what you just said.  You said until the plan is filed and approved the property remains in the possession of the Chapter 13 trustee.   ",05-996X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Was that Second Circuit's decision a decision that said the court didn't have the power because it had not been moved to take that action by the party who had the responsibility for raising the issue?  Was that the basis for the Second Circuit's decision?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then... then you haven't contradicted what the Chief Justice suggested.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Brunstad, are you going to address the mootness point?  Do you think the case is moot?   Antonin Scalia  Did you make the jurisdictional objection before the second bankruptcy court?   Antonin Scalia  How so?   Antonin Scalia  I find that extraordinary.   Antonin Scalia  This case, your case?   Antonin Scalia  What does the trustee do?  He's not really a trustee under 13, is he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the property doesn't vest in him, you've told it.  It remains in the ownership of the debtor?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He's called a trustee, though?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now why would there be any difference then?  That's a question I was about to put to you.  What if there is no indictment at all?  Why couldn't you say the same thing?  Well, you know, the only purpose of getting it is to see if there was probable cause and you now have a conviction beyond a reasonable doubt.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think it's pushing it, I think it's there.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dreeben, if we disagree with you here, could this defendant be retried?  Could he be reindicted?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dreeben, is attempt a lesser included offense of the substantive offense of illegal reentry?   ",05-998X
1,"Antonin Scalia  I would like to even sharpen Justice Breyer's hypothetical.  Let's assume that the indictment did set forth what the overt act was.  It did.  But there was no evidence of that overt act introduced before the grand jury.  What would the result of that be?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then the trial occurs--   Antonin Scalia  --He's convicted.  And I think you're going... your position is that conviction would stand.   Antonin Scalia  That doesn't seem to me to make a lot of sense.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't understand that.  You're saying it's a separate offense, but a lesser included offense is a separate offense.  It just happens to be embraced within some other offense.   Antonin Scalia  What does that mean, if you're tried for illegal entry and the Government doesn't prove the illegal entry because you're under supervision when you get in, the jury could not convict of attempt?   Antonin Scalia  And that would be okay, just charge with attempt without setting forth the overt acts for the attempt?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Baggot, could I come back to your answer to my earlier question.  You said you could only be convicted of the lesser included offense if the lesser included offense is set forth explicitly in the indictment.  Are you sure of that?   Antonin Scalia  Are you sure that's the law?   Antonin Scalia  As I said in my previous question, every lesser included offense is itself a substantive offense.  That doesn't distinguish attempt from anything else.  And my understanding is if you're charged with a greater offense, the lesser can be a subject of conviction even though it's not explicitly set forth in the indictment.   Antonin Scalia  And if that is the case here, then it seems to me he could have been convicted of attempt without ever having had set forth in the indictment the overt act that you demand.

1,"Antonin Scalia  It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court that found that the arbitration clause did not apply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It might have been the allegedly defrauded Chinese court which found that the arbitration clause did not apply.   Antonin Scalia  I don't see how that court would have gotten into the act unless that was the case.   Antonin Scalia  It was not, not--  felicitously put.  I think all the Court was saying was that there would no need for a doctrine of forum non conveniens where there is no personal jurisdiction.  The only point of the doctrine is to get rid of the case where you... where you do have jurisdiction.  And so you do not have to... but that doesn't mean that you must establish jurisdiction before you can exercise the doctrine.  It is a doctrine that overrides the existence of personal jurisdiction.  In that sense, it presupposes personal jurisdiction.     --That... that's right, Your Honor.  And in the court already determined it lacked subject matter jurisdiction or if venue was improper, then forum non conveniens would have no work to do.  But Gulf Oil certainly didn't address this question of the ordering of these restful matters.  And of course the doctrine of forum non conveniens, its entire purpose is to allow litigation to occur in a more convenient and appropriate forum, and it would undermine severely the purposes of the doctrine--   Antonin Scalia  Now, why is that?  Now... to some extent this is a call for the district judge.  There is a degree of discretion involved in it, and it's entirely conceivable that one district judge would correctly dismiss the case for forum non conveniens whereas another district judge faced with the same question would not do so.  And both of them would be acting lawfully; isn't that... isn't that conceivable?     It is in the nature of a discretionary determination, as Your Honor says, that... that different judges could reach different decisions.  In the Parsons case, Parsons versus Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, the Court emphasized there the question was whether a state court's forum non conveniens determination had preclusive effect on a Federal court's analysis of the factors.  And this Court held that did it not.  In large part because it's impossible to know that every factor would be the same or would be weighed the same by the second court.  And so I think it would be open to the second court to, to reanalyze the issues; but even if it weren't, even if there were some preclusive effects, I don't think that that undermines our position, because it is, of course, equally true of other threshold determinations such as personal and subject matter jurisdiction that they may have issue-preclusive effects in subsequent litigations.  For example, a trial court could decide that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction because the amount in controversy is insufficient because under state law, the plaintiff would not be able to recover punitive damage.  That determination would be given issue-preclusive effect in a subsequent suit filed by the same plaintiff in another district court.  In fact Justice Scalia wrote an opinion on that subject in the--  D.C. Circuit in the Dozier versus Ford Motor Company.   ",06-102X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, that only proved that an appellate court can affirm on grounds other than the ground relied upon by the district court, even if the ground relied upon by the district court is also a valid ground.  It's up to an appellate court... it's available to an appellate court, especially where the ground is jurisdiction, to choose to look into jurisdiction and say there isn't any.  I don't know, I don't know how that adds to your case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you found one appellate court that chose to do it that way.  Frankly, if I were sitting on an appellate panel I wouldn't do it that way if I thought the forum non conveniens ground was valid.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, why... I mean, I assume that in deciding forum non conveniens... that there is an inconvenient forum, the court making that judgment would assume that there was personal jurisdiction and would simply say, you know, put that into the mix.  Assuming we have personal jurisdiction, is this nonetheless an inconvenient forum?  And if the court can say yes, that's the end of the game.  I don't see what you have to gain here.  Suppose the Court does decide that it has jurisdiction and dismisses for forum non conveniens?  What, what... what are you gambling for here?  I don't understand what's the... what's the desirable outcome you hope to achieve?   Antonin Scalia  Right, and the district court at best for you, at best, finds personal jurisdiction.  If it finds no personal jurisdiction, you know, it dismisses for that reason instead of for forum non conveniens.  If it finds personal jurisdiction, it would say: Oh, there is personal jurisdiction; but I assumed there was personal jurisdiction when I dismissed it for forum non conveniens, so this is really the same call that I made before.  Dismissed for forum non conveniens.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but discovery for its own sake is no fun.  What does discovery for its own--  sake achieve?  [Laughter]  Unless there's something at the end of the discovery.  Now, maybe what you hoped is that the Republic of China would not accede to the discovery and therefore, you would get a default judgment or something.  You know, I just... I just don't see what's at the end of this game for you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I guess we should ask the other side, but I think I know what their answer will be, whether if the Court does dismiss on the basis of forum non conveniens without first addressing personal jurisdiction, it must assume the existence of personal jurisdiction?  And what do you think?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, I agree.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I agree.  So how are you going to get a different result then when it goes back and the court of appeals says, oh, yes, you had personal jurisdiction, just as you thought you did, whereupon the district court says, oh, yeah, same result.

It doesn't seem right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Don't dance around.  Is it... is it rendered an unreasonable search by the fact that I'm not a law enforcement officer at all?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So any Federal employee can go crashing around conducting searches and seizures?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So long as he has probable cause?   Antonin Scalia  That's fantastic.  [Laughter]  Do you really think that?   Antonin Scalia  Or that you are an administrative law judge at the, you know, Bureau of Customs?  It doesn't matter?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about a janitor?  You're a janitor, a federally employed janitor.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  His neighbor is growing marijuana, and he's just as offended as a Supreme Court Justice would be.  Can he conduct a search?   Antonin Scalia  Wow.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe we could say that in this, in these unique circumstances, where the officers could not let the fellow drive off without a license, it was not unreasonable to arrest him, but in some other situation where they had no arrest authority it would be.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you know, let's assume that the stop was not based on some, some deficiency in his license or some deficiency in the car... I don't know what else it could be... like, he had been going too fast, okay?  And it's just a misdemeanor.  He was five miles over the speed limit.  Now, in that situation you couldn't say, as you've said here, gee, if they just let him go, he'd still be driving without a license; they had to arrest him; they had no choice.  In that situation, he wouldn't necessarily be going above the speed limit.  Would that be... why couldn't you say it was reasonable here, but it wouldn't be reasonable there?   Antonin Scalia  If that's the argument you're making, then don't bring forward the argument that they couldn't let him go because he'd be in violation of the law.  If you want us to make that narrow a holding, I guess we can.  Is that what you want us to do?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, you're asking us to balance.  You're asking us to say, after all, in this case if they hadn't arrested he would have been violating the law as soon as they let him go.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You say this was not unlawful under Virginia law, then, because of the factor you brought forth?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't know what you're talking about a discretionary call.  It wasn't a discretionary call.  He couldn't arrest the person.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does the person making the arrest at least have to have some arrest authority?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or will a janitor do the job?  A janitor at the Justice Department becomes imbued with the mission of the Department and he goes around arresting people or searching people.   Antonin Scalia  Just as this person here didn't have positive law authority to engage in an arrest.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but he was purporting to act in an official capacity.  And he did, indeed, give the marijuana to the officials at the Justice Department.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. McCullough, what is here, for some reason the Commonwealth did not cite Cooper v.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  It's designed to test whether you really mean unlawful under State law.  Either you don't mean it, because something that violates a municipal ordnance is unlawful under State law, and yet you would not apply your test.  So you could express your test differently, unlawful under State statutory law.   Antonin Scalia  What about Cooper... Cooper v California?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Goldstein, can I bring you back to Cooper v. California?   Antonin Scalia  Which you say is a good case for you.  I don't see how you can say that.  This was a case of a car impounded.  The State court had said that there was no authority to search the car, simply because it was impounded, and we said the question here is not whether the search was authorized by State law; the question is rather whether the search was a reasonable one under the Fourth Amendment.  Just as a search authorized by State law may be an unreasonable one under that amendment, so may a search not expressly authorized by State law be justified as a constitutional reasonable one.  And you think that helps your case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even though the State law did not authorize it.

Did the prior statutes under which we made those holdings have a different structure?   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me all of those factors are a lot more subtle than the mere fact that we have said that this is jurisdictional for years and years, it and its predecessor. Why -- why isn't that at least as persuasive as the -- as the fragile attachments you're -- you're discussing here or even as the -- as the, you know, the -- even if the statute said that it's jurisdictional, we've said in our opinions that to say it's jurisdictional doesn't mean that it's jurisdictional necessarily. So I suppose we could say the same about the statute, couldn't we?   Antonin Scalia  It didn't say that. You're saying that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Haynes, isn't it less radical and, indeed, more in accord with the language of Irwin to -- to say that what Irwin overruled was not the whole principle that this statute of limitation is -- is -- and others that relate to sovereign immunity, is jurisdictional, but rather the much more limited rule that -- that statutes of limitations which are jurisdictional are not subject to equitable tolling? That's a much more limited point, and -- and the language of Irwin is a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed once Congress has made such a -- once Congress has made such a waiver, we think that making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the government in the same way that it is applicable to private suits amounts to little, if any -- little, if any -- broadening of the congressional waiver.  I don't think one can say that if you expand the principle to cover the whole -- the whole matter of whether it's jurisdiction. So why not read Irwin more moderately to -- to -- if we have to overrule one of two things, the whole doctrine of the jurisdictional nature of statutes of limitations in sovereign immunity cases and the other is simply, oh, yes, there is sovereign immunity, but can there be equitable tolling, why shouldn't we adopt the more limited one?

I thought the assumption was we're going to be using the government's new proposed system, in which the acceptance of voluntary departure is eliminated when you file a reopening petition, right.  So can the government then proceed to deport you involuntarily or is that also going to be stayed until, until completion of the reopening petition?   Antonin Scalia  And that, that involuntary deportation would effectively cancel the, the petition for reopening, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why are you willing to leave the involuntary deportees in that position, whereas you're not willing to leave the voluntary deportees in that position, that their reopening petition just vanishes?  Why is it any fairer for the involuntary deportees than for the voluntary?  In fact it's probably fairer for the voluntary because they made their choice.   Antonin Scalia  Do you agree with counsel for the government as to how long it typically takes for these motions to reopen to be disposed of?  He said something like 55 percent take, what, more than--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Your answer is yes, but the Attorney General's rule would prevent that... proposed rule would--   INTERRUPTING ",06-1181
1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kneedler, I think, I think that your, your opposing counsel gave a good answer to that.  I also thought it was a quid pro quo, but it's a very strange quid pro quo.  I could understand the government saying, look, if you accept voluntary departure your reopening is dead; you have to choose between asking for reopening or voluntary departure.  But that's not the quid pro quo you're saying that the government is adopting.  The quid pro quo is if you accept voluntary departure you roll the dice as to whether your reopening petition will be decided in time.  It isn't dead.  It's still there, but you just have to hope that it will be decided before you get deported.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand your answer.  You said you can or you can't from out of the country?   Antonin Scalia  So why, if you want to have a petition for reopening, why don't you just file an appeal and then file a petition for reopening and the appeal will enable you to stay in the country until your... your petition for reopening is--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You're appealing the immigration judge's decision.   Antonin Scalia  The immigration judge's decision, you're appealing that to the BIA.   Antonin Scalia  And that... that enables you to stay in the country--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --And at the same time you file a petition to reopen the... the administrative law judge's--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1181
0,"Antonin Scalia  Who says that... let's consider first the basis on which the court of appeals decided this case.  They decided it... in Rasul, we had held that the habeas statute extended to Guantanamo, and that those people who had filed their suits before the statute, at least, could bring a suit.  Congress acted.  And enacted a new habeas statute which makes it very clear that the habeas statute, at least, does not apply to these people in Guantanamo.  Your assertion here is that there is a common law constitutional right of habeas corpus that does not depend upon any statute.  Do you have a single case in the 220 years of our country or, for that matter, in the five centuries of the English empire in which habeas was granted to an alien in a territory that was not under the sovereign control of either the United States or England.   Antonin Scalia  What is... what are they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What cases... what case in particular do you think in Rasul?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mwenya involved an English... an English subject, not an alien.   Antonin Scalia  The question there is an alien.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it's totally irrelevant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In both of those cases, it was a citizen, nonetheless.  In 220 years of our history, or five centuries of the... do you have a single case in which it was not a citizen of England or a citizen of the United States in which a common-law writ of habeas corpus issued to a piece of land that was not within the sovereign jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They were not regarded as part of the crown's dominion, but they were part of the crown's sovereign territory.   Antonin Scalia  Okay, try them.  I mean, line them up.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the cases were decided under a statute that applied in India, not under... under the common law.  And the writ did not come from England; the writ came from English courts in India under a statute.  And we decided that in Rasul.  I mean, you want to do that in Rasul, that's fine.  But you are appealing to a common law right that somehow found its way into our constitution without, as far as I can discern, a single case in which the writ ever to a non-citizen.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Counsel, we had 400,000 German prisoners in this country during World War II.  And not a... you say it's clear in the Vietnam example that the Chief Justice gave you, it's clear that habeas would lie.  400,000 of these people.  It never occurred to them.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And many of them were civilians, by the way, and not in uniform.  Not a single habeas petition filed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He claims he wasn't assisting the German army, just as these people here claim that they were not attacking U.S. bases.   Antonin Scalia  Where... where was he held?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are you sure he was being held in Pennsylvania?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, you're being held within the jurisdiction of the United States.  I am still waiting for a single case, other than the Indian case which you mentioned which was under a statute, a single case in which an alien that... in a... in a territory not within the Crown, was granted habeas corpus.  And it's not enough to say there was a statute that applied on the seas.  That's fine.  Just give me one case.  There's not a single one in all of this lengthy history.   ",06-1195

It says you can't sue the sovereign even if you have a valid claim.  And when we say we will apply the same doctrine as to foreign sovereigns, it means the same thing.  I'm just not terribly persuaded by the fact that it has unfair consequences.  The doctrine of sovereign immunity always has unfair consequences.  So, unless you're asking us to abandon the doctrine, the fairness argument does not persuade me.   ",06-1204
1,"Antonin Scalia  We don't really know, do we, what the district court's order was based on?  Whether it was based on 401 or 403?  Did the district court explain its order at all?  It didn't, did it?   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me--   Antonin Scalia  --Yeah.  How do we know that's what the district court adopted?  I have... is it the order on 24a of the appendix to the petition?   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't mention... it doesn't mention which of the two of your arguments the district court is relying on.   Antonin Scalia  We're not talking about the rule.  We're trying to find out what it was the district court did.  Now, the court of appeals assumed the worst.  I mean, assumed what makes the case the hardest for you, and that is the court of appeals assumed that the district court relied on 401.  Is it customary to assume the worst?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If there's any basis on which the district court's decision would have been correct, the district court's decision is upheld.   Antonin Scalia  You... you want to defend the harder ground, I understand.  But what Justice Breyer has just said is not necessarily so.  The 403 as well.  If they're similarly situated, the... the time it would take to let in these other things and rebuttal of them, plus the prejudicial effect on the jury, would be outweighed by the fact that they're similarly situated, and, therefore, that it is stronger proof.  I don't see that one can tell from the district court's order whether the district court was relying on 401 or 403.  And certainly, you just don't want to defend 403.  I think you're digging a hole for yourself.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but here you have a company of 70,000 people.   Gregory G. Garre  You have a company of 70,000 people, but you have allegations that supervisors in the same division, implementing the same company-wide reduction-in-force plan in the same timeframe and giving similar explanations under similar circumstances, engaged in discrimination.  We think that the district dissenting judge in the court of appeals was right to say that evidence of that kind is at least marginally relevant, which would then put the focus on whether this evidence could be excluded under 403.   Antonin Scalia  It is hard to see what wouldn't be marginally relevant if you think that's marginally relevant.  It has to be a different supervisor in a different time frame.  I mean, sure.   Gregory G. Garre  Well, I think you've got other situations as well, Justice Scalia.  I think we've got a situation of a general comment of discriminatory animus.  For example, older people just don't get it, something like that.  I think the... the... by a different supervisor.  I think even if that's within the same office, the plaintiff is going to be hard-pressed even to meet the minimum-relevance threshold.  But the relevance threshold, as this Court has recognized in the Furnco v. Waters case and the Huddlestone case, this is a broad threshold that allows evidence in.  And then we look at the other parts of Article IV of the Federal Rules of Evidence to see whether it may be excluded--   Antonin Scalia  Why is that relevant... the same vicinity?  You're... you're--   Gregory G. Garre  --I think it is more likely--   Antonin Scalia  --Opposing counsel has said they are... they are three supervisors up.  What does the same vicinity have anything to do with this?   Gregory G. Garre  --Where you have supervisors in the same division, in the same vicinity, carrying out the same plan, providing the same distinct explanations in similar circumstances, a reasonable juror might infer that plaintiff's own--   Antonin Scalia  Well, one... one would have some... some tendency--   Gregory G. Garre  --And Justice Scalia--   Antonin Scalia  --What about one instead of three?  Would that have some tendency?  I guess it would.   Gregory G. Garre  --It might.  And that probably would be a strong candidate for exclusion under 403.  In the Furnco case--   Antonin Scalia  Why, by the way, do you think this was excluded under... under 401 rather than 403?   Gregory G. Garre  --Well, we... we acknowledge that the record isn't precisely clear on that.  We think that--   Antonin Scalia  Well, then why should it be assumed it was done properly rather than improperly?   Gregory G. Garre  --Largely because of what was said in the order, and because of the way it was briefed.   Antonin Scalia  What was said in the order?  I see nothing in the order that indicates it is under 401.   Gregory G. Garre  Well, it doesn't say 401, but the reason why the evidence can't come in is because the... the proffered witnesses didn't have the same supervisor.  The order is on page 24.   Antonin Scalia  But--   Gregory G. Garre  What the court excluded is any evidence of the pattern--   Antonin Scalia  --That's very relevant to the 403 determination.   Gregory G. Garre  --It's relevant, but not it's certainly not determinative, and we think in a case like this, where this kind of evidence is the critical evidence for the trial... in the case--   Antonin Scalia  Picky, picky, picky on the trial court.  I must say.   Gregory G. Garre  --Yeah--   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me this order should be... should be given... it should be treated as if, it could be sustained, it should be sustained.   Gregory G. Garre  --With respect, Justice Scalia, in this case, this proffered evidence was the crux of the trial, the critical issue.  It came up not only in the context of the motion in limine, it came up in the context of the motion for a new trial.  And if you look at what the district court said in denying a motion for a new trial, she said again... and this is on page 436 of the JA... she says,  ""none of the proffered evidence makes it more likely that the decisionmakers in this case discriminated against the plaintiff.

Only one these three?   Antonin Scalia  One of these three other employees who complained about age discrimination.  Would that have the same tendency to show it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think one is enough?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I'm not talking about somebody up at the top.  I'm talking about somebody on the same level as the supervisor that you're concerned with.  One other supervisor in this company of 70,000 has... is accused of having made age-discriminatory decisions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, all of these are just accused.  We have... none of this has been proven.   Antonin Scalia  So--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Egan, what if I think that, had he engaged in a balancing, it would have been an abuse of discretion not to exclude it?  What if I think that?  Then what happens with this case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but I am worried about having five trials... you know, one trial turning into six trials.  I mean those are the factors that I am concerned about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They may have just thought the game isn't worth the candle.  Just thought we've sunk so much money into this case by now and it's just not worth the risk.   Antonin Scalia  And that's the problem that concerns me.  It is not the question of whether the trial is going to last for three weeks.  It is a question at the prospect that the trial will last for three weeks and they will have to go out and find other people in their organization and depose them and bring them in to show them it is not the culture.  They just say it is not worth the candle.  Just settle the case and get out.  All of these things are relevant to how you rule on 403 it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems very strange to me that we... there's been... the case went to the jury without the evidence you wanted to get in.  The jury found for the company.  Now if the... if the trial court is going to properly exclude the evidence under 403, we should then have the very same trial with a new jury?  That doesn't seem proper.   ",06-1221

0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Those -- those risks were set forth on the labeling approved by the FDA.  Surely that sentence means it shall be revised to include a warning as soon, as soon as there is reasonable evidence of an association of a serious hazard that the FDA has not considered.  And that is not already addressed on the labeling.  I mean to read it as -- as opening up stuff that's already been considered by the FDA would -- would -- would make a -- a mush out of it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you're just contradicting the labeling.  The fact is they could not have approved that label unless they made that determination.  Now, if you're telling me the FDA acted irresponsible -- irresponsibly, then sue the FDA.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the labeling made it very clear that the preferred method of administering this medicine was -- was -- was muscular and -- and that there were serious risks involved in -- in the IV push.  Moreover, your client didn't follow the labeling or your client's physician didn't follow the labeling prescription for IV push, did he?   Antonin Scalia  No.  Wait, wait.  He administered a -- a level of the drug that was vastly in excess of -- of -- of what the labeling said could safely be used for IV push.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Had no bearing.  Are you serious?   Antonin Scalia  You established that there were new problems?  I mean, if there were new problems, then -- then they could have simply supplemented the labeling.  But did you establish that there were problems that had not been considered already by the FDA?  I mean, the labeling says, you know, that this is dangerous to use -- use IV push.  It made it very clear that it's dangerous.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It proposed a more restrictive label to the FDA, didn't it?  And the FDA said, no, you use this label.  In other words, it's -- what you're saying was not its call.  It was the call of the FDA.   Antonin Scalia  What if it referred to new drug risks, then, in your preceding sentence, where you are saying manufacturers change it all the time as new drug risks become apparent?

And every time there is a jury verdict on some -- on some other -- some other ground not -- not prohibited by the label, they just add that to the label; and they submit it to -- to the FDA and the -- and until -- unless and until the FDA conducts an investigation and disapproves that label, that labeling change occurs.  How many -- how many -- you mentioned a number of -- of times that -- that label alterations are -- are proposed.  I mean, this is going to be a massive operation for the FDA.   Antonin Scalia  It would not promote public safety if you believe that the name of this game is balancing benefits and costs.

Antonin Scalia  Isn't there a trustee obligation to pay all... all expenses which if not paid will... would cause a depletion of the assets?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can't you say that that's a trustee response...

I mean, I understand why you do it, so that can you have a nice clear line, which I am all for.  But the line given by your colleague is just as clear.  I don't know why I should accept yours when... I mean, ""would"" just does not mean ""could"".  I mean, would have, could have, should have, it's... they're different words.   Antonin Scalia  Give me a context where... where... other than this statute, where in common parlance people use ""would"" to mean ""could"".   Antonin Scalia  No, I don't think it would mean that.   Antonin Scalia  Anything that could not be done of course would not be done.  But that doesn't mean that the... that the two words mean the same thing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's true that one is included within the other, but they don't mean the same thing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What could not happen would not happen, of course.  But it doesn't mean that... the two concepts are not the same.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I have the same problem.  You know, I... it seems to me that it is entirely reasonable to say only a trustee can seek investment advice concerning what he should do to fulfill his responsibilities under the trust.  Only a trustee can do that.  A private individual might seek investment advice as to how he could maximize the income or... or the growth of the funds that he has, but only... only a trustee seeks advice as to how he can fulfill his responsibilities under the trust.  And you could say that's distinctive.  No individual would do that because he's not a trustee.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It may... it may well be the same advice, but in... but in one case it is... it is advice sought by and given to a trustee, a unique kind of advice.  In... in substance, it may turn out to be the same; but it's not the same advice you're giving to a private individual.  You're saying here's the trust instrument and here are the objects to be achieved by the trust instrument and this is the... the advice that will best do that.  That doesn't happen with an individual.   Antonin Scalia  Can you really spice up advice that way?  You ask the advisor, say, which... what percentage of your advice was the advice that went to maximizing total return and what percentage went to this other thing?  I mean, gee, I don't want to get courts into trying to figure that out, or private individuals or financial advisors in trying to figure that out.  That's just a crazy way to run a tax system, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's not all advice.  That's just some of the advice, right?   Antonin Scalia  Now, what about the rest of it?  How do you slice up, you know... now, investment advisor, tell me what percentage of your advice went to the total return and what percentage went to other things.  I don't think the investment advisor is going to be able to tell you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And whatever line you... you pick, I guarantee you, trusts are going to break themselves up into mini-trusts that fall under the line.  I mean people aren't stupid.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I think ""would not have occurred"" is pretty good--   Antonin Scalia  --actually.   Antonin Scalia  The cost of the advice?  What percentage of the costs incurred by a trust do you think the investment advice consists of?  I mean, it seems to me the main thing a trustee ordinarily does, at least if he is a trustee of just cash, is to invest it.  It seems to me his major expense must be getting financial advice, isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, imagine something else.  Guess.  What other, what other expense could even approximate that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And then my follow-up is, is there any... I don't care about legislative history but some of my colleagues do.  Is there any... is there any indication that Congress thought it was, it was whacking trusts with this immense new tax with respect to their major expenditure?  I expect it must be their major expenditure.   Antonin Scalia  The dog didn't bark.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you know a trust is sort of like a business.  And deductions that an individual could not take if he were not in a business are perfectly okay for a business.  And I don't know why trusts wouldn't be treated the same way.  A trust has to get investment advice.  True?  When it's... when it's an individual getting it, you wouldn't allow a deduction, but a trust is different.  And unless Congress is clearer than this statute, I... it seems to me that no individual would get trust investment advice.  Only a trust can get trust investment advice.   INTERRUPTING ",06-1286

I can see your argument that it ought to be covered, but to say that the plain language covers it, I mean that's extraordinary.  The plain language doesn't cover it.   Antonin Scalia  But in Jackson it was in a different statute and here it's in the same statute.  Surely that makes a big difference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not familiar with that provision.  What does that provision say?   Antonin Scalia  Well, no.  I mean, they're all in the same, in the same statute, and what that provision says is that just because we give certain relief in, in the portion applicable to private discrimination, does not mean that we give that relief in the section applicable to government discrimination, where it is explicitly withheld... it can't be explicitly withheld... where it is withheld, although it's explicitly included for private discrimination.  I think that's the only sensible way to read that provision.  It surely doesn't make two statutes out of, out of one.  It is simply one statute.   Antonin Scalia  I think you're saying even if, even if that were the case, they would still urge the Court to come out the way they do.  I don't think they're conceding that that's the case.

I mean, you're saying it's not true because our interpretation of Title VII is true.  But the point goes to how you ought to interpret Title VII.  That is, it makes more sense to say when it's retaliatory action you use your Federally prescribed remedies within the agency.  I mean, it doesn't answer the point that Justice Breyer made to say, because we want to interpret Title VII the way we want to interpret it.  His point is: One reason to interpret it the way you do want to interpret it is that it makes more sense to have all of the Federal remedies applied through the agency, through the agency mechanism, rather than in court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Would you clarify your earlier statement: These people have no remedies just for retaliation?

Antonin Scalia  Mr. Garre, are we going to have to decide the Title VII question in this case?  We don't even have the materials in front of us.  They haven't been put in the appendix to the briefs.  And in order to decide this case, we're going to have to decide a Title VII case that hasn't even been presented?   INTERRUPTING ",06-1321
1,"Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  I mean, that... that seems to me a very strange argument.  You say since... since the EEOC must give notice when a charge is filed, if it doesn't give notice, no charge has been filed.  That doesn't make sense.  I mean, it's just like saying, you know, you have a civil rule, a rule of civil procedure, that says, you know, after a complaint has been filed there shall be an answer within 60 days.  And if no answer is filed, no complaint has been filed?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, it just doesn't track.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So give me another one that will enable me to rule in your favor?   Antonin Scalia  All right.  Now, does... does the person who's filed a proper charge know whether notice has been given or not?  Is a copy of the notice always given to the filer.   Antonin Scalia  It said it wasn't a charge, didn't it?  Didn't it say that it's not a charge?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Precharge counseling.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't that eliminate the whole purpose of the... of the preliminary document, to weed out those charges that relate to employment in France?   Antonin Scalia  It will... it will be a charge even if it's in France?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think that's right.  I think what it boils down to is it'll be a charge if we decide to give notice, and it won't be a charge if we don't decide to give notice.   Antonin Scalia  Which is very nice for the EEOC, but not--   Antonin Scalia  --Intake questionnaire.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I thought you said you were deprived of something else.  I mean, the statute provides for a conciliation process in which you can talk to the employee and say, you know, what happened?  And you may well be able to satisfy the employee with... before... before she lawyers up.  I think it's a big disadvantage to... to have no contact with the employee until there's a lawyer on the other side, and you can't talk to her confidentially; you can't make a conciliation notice.  I think that's a considerable disadvantage, and it's... it's a situation that the statute did not envision.   Antonin Scalia  Well, as a practical matter, you can't conciliate after suit anyway.  You can negotiate with the lawyer--   Antonin Scalia  --on the other side.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, what is your test?  When is it a charge?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And don't tell me when notice is given.   Antonin Scalia  My goodness.  It's like saying there's no complaint until an answer is filed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's just not true.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, only because I'm sane.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  But there can't be equitable tolling unless she has really filed a charge.  So sooner or later... you cannot run away from it... you're going to have to give us a definition of what a charge is.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're only going to give her equitable tolling if in fact she's, she's filed a charge.  And you don't give me any... unless you want to fall back on the manifest destiny rule or...--  [Laughter]   ",06-1322
0,"Antonin Scalia  Is this after the real charge was filed or what everybody concedes--   Antonin Scalia  --The charge form.   Antonin Scalia  But suit was pending at that time.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's pretty risky.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Answer my question.  Was suit already filed at that point?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Wait.  I'm sorry.  247 during that whole period?   Antonin Scalia  That's the only number of mistakes they have made; is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm astounded if that's the only number of mistakes they made, from 19--   Antonin Scalia  --Oh, with respect to Fed Ex.   Antonin Scalia  Oh.   Antonin Scalia  What's... what's wrong with this?  Why don't I... I mean, I do believe that the thing either is a charge or isn't a charge before the EEOC decides whether it's going to give notice or not.  It either is or isn't.  Now, what about this: It is a charge if it reasonably appears to be a charge, or if you want to say ""manifest intent"", that's okay, too.  Now, if you signed a document which... which says that it is a prefiling document and the purpose is to discuss a future charge, it seems to me you know, or ought to know, that this is not a charge.  And we can't run the system for people who are either illiterate or don't even have friends who are literate.  We can't run a system that way.  So I look at this, and I say this is not a charge.   Antonin Scalia  Now, if the EEOC chooses to give notice, then I guess you could say one that's close to the boundary line becomes a charge retroactively, and there is... there is no harm done.  You can have the counseling, and so forth.  But when you come in with something that doesn't look like a charge, it seems to me if there is no notice given and you get into the situation that is here where the company has been deprived of the conciliation opportunity, deprived of the opportunity to preserve evidence and whatnot, it seems to me the fault should lie on your client, because she filed something that any reasonable person should know is not a charge.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whatever it was, this thing says it's a precharge document.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why do you think... why do you think they must have lost it?  Why did you think they must have lost it: Because she hadn't been given a number?   Antonin Scalia  Even if they treat it as a charge, they don't docket it?   Antonin Scalia  I really think the problem here is the EEOC, rather than anybody else.   Antonin Scalia  It does, indeed, have this form which says... which says that its purpose... information provided on this form will be used by Commission employees to determine the existence of the facts relevant to a decision as to whether the Commission has jurisdiction and to provide such precharge filing counseling, blah, blah, blah.  All of that, however, is contained as part of the Privacy Act statement.   Antonin Scalia  And if the filer is not interested in keeping any of it confidential, I wouldn't even read the Privacy Act.   Antonin Scalia  Well, what kind of an agency is this?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Where does that appear?   Antonin Scalia  In its very definition of a ""charge"", it says a charge shall be in writing and shall name the prospective respondent and shall generally... shall generally allege the discriminatory acts.  That's what it must contain.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't say that anything that contains that is a charge.   Antonin Scalia  I could write out something that contains all three of those things.  Would that be a charge?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.  Let's try something else.   Antonin Scalia  Well, then, all intake questionnaires are a charge, because they all contain that.  I mean that definition is simply inconsistent with the... with the agency's assertion that it has something called an intake questionnaire which does not constitute a charge unless... I don't know... unless there's manifest whatever it is.  That's inconsistent because all of those intake questionnaires contain all of that information--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --set forth in 26.3.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Heytens, let me tell you going in that my... my main concern in this case, however the decision comes out, is to do something that will require the EEOC to get its act in order, because this is nonsense: These regulations that are contradicted by forms; this failure to give notice, but it's okay because it's a charge anyway.  This whole situation can be traceable back to the agency, and I... whoever ends up bearing the burden of it, it's the agency's fault, and this scheme has to be revised.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.   Antonin Scalia  That's within 10 days of the charge, but that assumes, it seems to me, what's to be proven.  I mean what is the charge?   Antonin Scalia  If... if the prefiling, the intake thing, is not a charge, there is no problem.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can you not make that not a charge by saying in bold letters on the top: This is not a charge.  If you want a charge, ask for Form 5?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why do the courts have to struggle with this when the agency could put in bold letters at the top: This is a charge or this is not a charge?  Why do Federal district judges have to inquire into manifest intent from now until doomsday?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where is that in CFR?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Heytens, what's your solution for the situation where the EEOC treats it as a charge, but doesn't give notice, which is what has happened here?  How do you think that should play out?   Antonin Scalia  That's right.   ",06-1322
0,"Antonin Scalia  Of course you could say the same thing if the mission here sold its property to someone and someone was claiming the right to possess the property by reason of the sale.  And you could come up and say this is simply, simply a case deciding the, the ultimate issue of whether the sale occurred or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it would clearly come within the property right exception, wouldn't it?  You... you don't go one step back to look at the transaction that created the, the right in real property assuming the right in real property exists.   Antonin Scalia  Let's assume that, let's assume that exception didn't exist.   Antonin Scalia  And you had nothing but the real estate exception.  You would come in and say this ultimately relates to not who owns the real estate but whether there was a proper contract or not.  And I... frankly we wouldn't accept that.   Antonin Scalia  Can't he force a sale of the property to collect the lien?   Antonin Scalia  I understand that this action does not because of the sovereign immunity.  But... but we are talking about what the nature of a lien is.  In an ordinary case cannot a lien holder force a sale of the property so that he can get out the money represented by his lien?   Antonin Scalia  Well, how can he commence an action to foreclose on the property unless he in any ordinary sense of the term has an interest in the property?   Antonin Scalia  You're distinguishing between rights in property and interests in property?  I would think that every right in property is an interest in property and vice versa.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Congress didn't really say it.  I mean the committee said it to be precise.   Antonin Scalia  Good.   Antonin Scalia  That's not beyond the realm of the conceivable, is it?   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't buying land that you're not using for your embassy itself, or for the residence of the ambassador, but buying and occupying that land which subjects yourself to real estate taxes on that land, why isn't that a commercial activity?   Antonin Scalia  So the Indian embassy could own real estate throughout New York City, which it wouldn't have to pay taxes on?  Or if it didn't, nothing could be done about it?   Antonin Scalia  Why?  No.  You're saying, you're saying it's not a commercial activity.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It depends upon the use, and the use in this case is not... is not the embassy itself or the residence of the ambassador.  I mean, they could use a piece of property for anything.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the buying and occupying of it is commercial activity.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, this isn't a suit for the taxes.  I mean, we are not talking about a suit for the taxes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We are talking about a declaration as to the interest in the land.   Antonin Scalia  That's always brought up to answer the problem, well, you know... let me give you a case in which it obviously is not a commercial activity, but it seems to me that the... that the lien interest has to be honored.  Let's suppose that there is an American who is very friendly to and sympathetic with the Indian government, and gives them real estate, not a commercial activity, he gives them real estate in which to house the employees in... in their mission.  However, he retains an interest in that real estate.  He retains a lien on the real estate, to have money paid to him at some point.  He is not willing to give the full amount of the property, but most of it.  And he retains a lien.  Now, under your theory, that lien would not be enforceable, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Enforceable or not.   Antonin Scalia  That seems very strange to me.   Antonin Scalia  What property is it a right in if not the immovable property?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it follows that immovable property and when the immovable property disappears the lien disappears.  You know, if it's blown away or flooded, it's now in the Atlantic; the lien is--  gone.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't have to be a right in the property.  If you look at it from the owner's point of view, it is a cloud on the owner's title in the property.  It affects the owner's title.  Even if you assert that it doesn't give any title to the lien holder, it impairs the title of the property owner.  And that's all that's required, as I read the title, in which rights in immovable property are an issue, and here the question is whether the, the mission's right to the property is, is impaired by this lien.   Antonin Scalia  It affects the right to convey the property free and clear, which is an enormous right that goes along with the real estate.   Antonin Scalia  What about an easement?  That doesn't involve any of those things.  You can't exclude people and so forth.   ",06-134X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Cardozo, before you go any further, I had been under the impression from your brief that you're not trying to enforce anything against, against India or against the mission.  You just said you wanted a declaratory judgment that the lien is a valid lien.  But, but here it is in your complaint you're asking for foreclosure.  Which, which is it?   Antonin Scalia  You just asked for it to scare them?  Was that it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, but they'll say as was their response to a lot of hypotheticals, the commercial act exception covers that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why didn't you just say... you know, if you're worried about the malevolence of countries to make all sorts of stuff liens, I guess if they're malevolent enough they can make all sorts of stuff easements, which, which the other side says is undoubtedly a property interest.  So they could say that, you know, if you're held liable the court can give you an easement over the property of, of the defendant worth so much money.  And that would undoubtedly be enforceable.   Antonin Scalia  Do you know any States that don't?  Isn't it fairly standard?  For--   Antonin Scalia  --Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The... the... the European, the European treaty looks at it from the other side, you're saying.  It looks at it from the foreign sovereign side.   Antonin Scalia  Would the obligations arising out of the property in the European Convention include the obligation to pay taxes, property taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This says what explicitly?   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask you what, what do you get out of this case?  You've withdrawn your claim for judgment of foreclosure.  What are you going to get out of it?  Declaratory judgment that they owe the taxes?  I'm not sure they have ever contested that they don't owe taxes.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You say he is wrong about a lot of other stuff.  [Laughter]  Why do you believe him about that?   Antonin Scalia  Well, wait a minute.  But the... the embassy has rights in it when the case is brought, even before the final judgment.  So you know, let's give the devil his due.  It would be a case in which rights in immovable property are in issue.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You want to look at it from the embassy side too so--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, that's your big defense.  To do that they would have to do it for everybody' they would have to do it for Joe Sixpack as well as for the embassy, right?   Antonin Scalia  What do you do with traffic tickets?  They've built up.  You know, there's $100,000 owing in traffic tickets by some embassy.  How do you get a judgment that that is owing?

1,"Antonin Scalia  You'd not wager, however, right?   Antonin Scalia  You're taxing Mead, not Nexis/Lexis?   Antonin Scalia  So what relevance is it that Nexis/Lexis has business in Illinois?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean that's fine if that's who you're taxing.   Antonin Scalia  I might say that I don't follow that.  It seems to me what you can establish from the fact that it did a lot of business in Illinois is that can you tax it and... but I don't see how.   Antonin Scalia  Do you have any case like that where your ability to tax a surviving corporation has to do with, not whether the surviving corporation itself has sufficient contacts with the State, but whether some other corporation that has disappeared now but that merged into it had sufficient... it seems to me you have to establish connection with the taxpayer.  Not... not with somebody from whom the taxpayer made some money.   Antonin Scalia  That's fine.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that isn't established by the mere fact that Lexis/Nexis did business there.  Ultimately you have to come down to connecting it to Mead, either by your unitary business doctrine or by this functional doctrine that you're relying on.   ",06-1413

They can't overrule it, but change the law--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --so that Patterson would no longer be right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think that they would be astounded.   Antonin Scalia  What change did the 1991 amendment make then?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You say it was intended to change the outcome of Patterson.  In what respect?  You say not in the respect of whether retaliation is included but in what respect then?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand you.  Patterson said that post formation actions were not covered, right?   Antonin Scalia  Retaliation is one, but just one of many post formation actions, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What other post formation actions were there that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --What was the post formation action that was in action in Patterson?   Antonin Scalia  It didn't specify them.  I think your point is probably that it includes the same post formation conduct that is prohibited at formation, which is to say discrimination on the basis of race, which is not retaliation; right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why did they... why did they proceed under Title VII then?  What... what help--   Antonin Scalia  --Does... does the person who is retaliated against, that is the person who complained and is retaliated against, have to be the person who was discriminated against?   Antonin Scalia  Surely... surely, you don't mean what you just said a minute ago, that in order to have a retaliation claim you must have a discrimination claim.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Surely it's your position that even when you have a discrimination claim, you don't have a retaliation claim.  I thought it was your position there are no retaliation claims under this statute.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Any other advantages to 1981?  You get attorney's fees in 1981?   Antonin Scalia  But you get that under Title VII?   Antonin Scalia  Is there a Federal common law?  Are we sitting here trying to write a Federal common law?   Antonin Scalia  So State courts can do that.  They can make it up; can't they?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Hawkins, don't we have a whole line of recent cases which say we have set our face against implying causes of action?

Antonin Scalia  So why don't you invoke those?   Antonin Scalia  Why do you agree with that?  I don't understand why you agree with that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then don't say ""yes"".  I mean, it may well be that Congress thought our interpretation of 1981 was perfectly reasonable, or it had no idea what our interpretation of 1981 was.  But they know what they wanted to do in... in 1991.  Okay?   Antonin Scalia  That's all we know for sure.   Antonin Scalia  That Congress wanted that disposition.  They weren't necessarily disapproving our prior decision.  Is there anything in the statute which said the Supreme Court made a bad decision, and we're going to fix it?

Antonin Scalia  It could have been a teenager who wrote the report.   ",06-1431
0,"Antonin Scalia  That's a good argument to Congress.  Congress should enact a retaliatory provision.  But the statute says what it says, and what it says is that there has to be discrimination on the basis of race.  And firing somebody for... in retaliation for making a complaint is not firing him on the basis of race.  Indeed, the person making the complaint may not have been the person who was racially discriminated against.  You would acknowledge that you couldn't fire... if retaliations claims lie, you couldn't fire a white whistleblower who says this employer has been discriminating against blacks.  Wouldn't that white whistleblower have a cause of action for being fired?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  On your theory, but that has nothing to do with the text of the statute, which requires discrimination on the basis of race.  I agree with you entirely that it would make sense to provide a cause of action for retaliation, but we don't write statutes.  We read them.  And there's nothing in this statute that says that.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you can say that, but it doesn't make any sense.   Antonin Scalia  It didn't make any sense then, either.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I guess those court of appeals cases pre-1991 that found there was a retaliation claim, right, those cases were just wrong as to whether there was any post contract claim?  Right?  I mean, they were wrong about that.  Patterson, in effect, said you're wrong.   Antonin Scalia  So if they were wrong about whether there's a post contract claim, why wouldn't they be wrong about whether there's a retaliation claim?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't know why we should give deference to them on the one point when they've been proven wrong on the other one.   Antonin Scalia  It's a little more complicated than that.  We inferred that cause of action in the bad old days, when we were inferring causes of action all over the place.  Now, the position the Government takes here is that we should infer this new cause of action to assist the one that's already on the books.  Is the Government going to be consistent in this position?  And you want us to in the future go back to our prior practice of readily inferring causes of action that are not set forth in the... in the text of this statute?  Is the Government willing to live with that?   Antonin Scalia  Patterson was still the bad old days.  When do you think the bad old days ended?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Oh, I'm sorry.

I said market manipulation.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kneedler, I'm not entirely understanding you.  Why should the fact that the seller later acquired market power have anything to do with whether the initial contract, when he did not have market power, was a fair one?  The contracts are already down in black and white, his later acquisition of market power cannot affect--   Antonin Scalia  --I understand.  But later acquisition of market power would result in a cancellation of the permission for this particular firm to enter into contracts for the future, but I don't see why it would affect the past contracts.   Antonin Scalia  Well, good for them.  [Laughter]  I mean you're suggesting they should be punished for that?  I don't understand what... what follows?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Didn't your clients know that the market was chaotic at the time they entered into this long term contract?  I mean does this come as a surprise that after the fact, now that you're paying more than the market price is, you want to kick over a long term contract you entered into?  What has changed?  Did you not know that the market was chaotic?  Wasn't that the very reason you entered into the long term contract.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In fact, you did very well under these contracts.  Initially, you were even reselling some of the energy that you got.  You got it at a price so much below what was then the market that you made a profit by reselling it.  But now that things have changed, you don't like the long term contract.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Wright, I really don't understand why you would... why you say, you know, if... if the chaos is due to the weather or maybe, you know, an Arab oil embargo or whatever, that that's perfectly okay.  But if it's due to manipulation, it's bad.  I can understand if you added manipulation by one of the parties, by the sellers, that I could understand.  But so long as it's a factor extrinsic to the parties to the contract, what difference does it make to the buyer whether the flukishness of the market is caused by the weather or by manipulation by somebody other than the seller?  In other words, I think it's not enough to show manipulation.  That's what's going on in the market.  And you're trying to save yourself from it.  So long as it's not manipulation by the seller, I don't see how you have a... I don't know... an equitable case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just and reasonable when?

Antonin Scalia  May I ask, I am sure you understand that a finding that there was no manipulations that affected these contracts is not the same as a finding that there was no manipulation by these sellers in the market.

1,"Antonin Scalia  I would have thought you would... you would say that when you have a contract which says that any disputes under this shall be arbitrated pursuant to the rules of the AAA or whatever, that that does automatically exclude a parallel proceeding.  Otherwise, provisions like that make no sense at all; they achieve nothing.   Antonin Scalia  Nor do you mean that California applies even when it contradicts the express provisions of your agreement?  I mean, the specific governs of the general?   Antonin Scalia  But that's not positive Federal law.  What stops him from doing it is the contractual agreement, isn't it, between the parties?  The FAA just says that the State will not set aside that contractual agreement.   Antonin Scalia  When we say we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract, it means we'll arbitrate all disputes under this contract; neither one of us will go to court.   Antonin Scalia  I used to teach contract law, and I am sure that when you say you'll arbitrate, it means you won't litigate.  And even if I didn't ever teach contract law, it would still be the law.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  You think Volt would have come out the same way if... if in fact, all of the parties in this other litigation had agreed to arbitration?  You have any doubt--   Antonin Scalia  --Yeah.  I do, too.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Writing broadly is known as dictum, isn't it?  [Laughter]   ",06-1463
0,"Antonin Scalia  Did you take a position below?  Your friend says that this is brand new up here.   Antonin Scalia  Why would you want this to happen?  Why... who would imagine such a system in which you bring it to the Labor Commissioner and you prevent the matter from being resolved immediately with an arbitrator.  I don't know how long does it take for the Labor Commissioner?  I don't know.   Antonin Scalia  Eight months.  But then when he's done--   Antonin Scalia  --She.  No matter what happens, you go back to the arbitrator.  Who in his right mind would set up such a system?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This person is not a talent agent.   Antonin Scalia  Judgment involved would have been binding--   Antonin Scalia  --on the third parties.  You don't... and you assert that the judgment here wouldn't be binding at all.  It's just because the Labor Commissioner, he or she, is such an expert on this... your opponent says she's not at all--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, I imagine that's highly debatable.  It's a different case where you say you have to wait for a court decision which will be conclusive as to many of the people in the case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  His hypothetical was that the court decision would just be advisory and the arbitrator could ignore it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just get, you know, a knowledgeable person's input.   Antonin Scalia  This contract said the same thing.  This contract will be governed by California law.   Antonin Scalia  Would it suck up this provision that says you have to go to the Superior Court?   Antonin Scalia  No.  I don't think so either.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  You say... I thought you said it doesn't become binding.  That it is just advice to the arbitrator.  Once you... once you get the remand to the arbitrator, it is not binding.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  But--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, I don't understand... so you incorporate California law.  I interpret that to mean substantive law of California.  You say also incorporates... and this is what I find peculiar.  California law gives you a procedural right to go to the labor commission.  But it also gives you a procedural right to go to superior court.  And, yet, you acknowledge that the arbitration agreement, when you say we will arbitrate, forecloses your using the superior court.  Why doesn't it foreclose your using the labor commissioner?  I don't understand how you slice the bologna that thin.  To me, if it excludes California procedures, it excludes both the labor commissioner and the superior court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let me... I want to understand that answer.  California law includes the Superior Court as much as it includes the labor commissioner.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the California Supreme Court would construct a system in which you get the advice of this expert, the Labor Commissioner.  One of the parties thinks that this expert's advice is ridiculous, just absolutely wrong.  Now, California law generally considers the Superior Court smarter than the Labor Commissioner, which is why you get de novo review before the Superior Court.   Antonin Scalia  No?   Antonin Scalia  It is stupider than the Labor Commissioner.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.  I will amend it.  The California Superior Court is ex officio smarter than the Labor Commissioner, okay?  And yet, one of the parties who thinks the Labor Commissioner is dead wrong doesn't get a chance to have this advice corrected the way the California constitution envisions, by the ex officio smarter Superior Court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that is the scheme that the California Supreme Court is going to embed in California law?   Antonin Scalia  The latter is disputed.  The latter is vigorously disputed.   ",06-1463
1,"Antonin Scalia  For which purpose you'd include the receipts?   Antonin Scalia  For which purpose you would include the receipts that he sent to his girlfriend instead of putting them in the corporate treasury?   Antonin Scalia  I'm less concerned with the word ""distribution"" in the statute than I am with the phrase ""with respect to its stock""...  ""distribution made by a corporation to a shareholder with respect to its stock. ""  Now, the court below held that there had to be a conscious intent to return capital.  Even if I disagree with that and think that that was wrong, isn't the Government right that it nonetheless is the burden to establish that the distribution here was a distribution with respect to stock, and the distribution was given to the girlfriend who owns no stock in the corporation.  How does it become a distribution with respect to stock?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or girlfriends.  I mean, why doesn't it distinguish a girlfriend as much as it distinguishes an employee who's receiving back a loan?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the Government would say yes?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That one little element: That he has to show the distribution was not because this was his girlfriend, but it was with respect to stock, and the record is... is that the intent?   ",06-1509
0,"Antonin Scalia  The court below didn't give him a chance--   Antonin Scalia  --to establish that.  The court below required him to show an intent to distribute capital.   Antonin Scalia  But that was... we're just not on the same page here.  That's not what the... the decision you're defending said.  The decision you're defending did not say that it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it was with respect to stock.  They said it was incumbent on the defendant to show that it was intended to be a return of capital.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's just a wholly different issue, and it seems to me the best you can get out of this case, the way you're arguing it, is a remand for them to apply the proper test.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I doubt that.  Then... then, you would say, when it is not a criminal prosecution for failure to pay taxes, so long as somebody, when they take the money, intended it to be a return of dividends, it does not become a return of capital.  Are you sure you're willing to live with that intent requirement?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  At the time... is it important for the tax treatment that at the time of the distribution it be intended to be either a return of capital or dividends?  Does that make the difference as to whether you're going to be able to tax it or not?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I'm not... we are not talking about distribution.   Antonin Scalia  We are talking about the intent that it be a return of capital or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Either one.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It could be anything at all.  So in other words, there is no preliminary requirement that you intend that it be a return of capital.  Right.  So if the Court of Appeals said that here, it was wrong.   Antonin Scalia  He wants a chance to argue that.  He was not given a chance to argue that.   Antonin Scalia  He said... and it seems to me that this is enough to put you on notice...  ""Boulware will present further evidence that all of the alleged unreported income was either a loan or advance or was used by Boulware for corporate purposes or for the benefit of HIE. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, ""for corporate purposes"" would include either a return of capital or a dividend, payment out to shareholders.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Surely he is entitled to try to prove that.  And I'm still hung up on your assertion that he made no proffer on it below.  Here's another portion of the joint appendix.  The expert, his expert, he says, will further explain that if Boulware used... this is on page 97, bottom of 97:  ""If Boulware used the moneys for corporate purposes, the moneys were not income to Boulware. ""  ""Alternatively, the expert will explain that if the moneys were not loans or advances or if Boulware did not use the moneys for corporate purposes, then as the controlling shareholder, the moneys could be deemed a constructive dividend or a return of capital to Boulware, which may or may not be income depending on whether or not HIE had earnings.

1,"Antonin Scalia  So a co-worker of your client says: You know, the boss really was guilty of sexual harassment and the co-worker says: Gee, that's terrible.   Antonin Scalia  That's enough?  That's opposition?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about, violating the law is terrible?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  But if she said that in response to the remark by the co-worker that she had been subjected to sexual harassment and then the remark was ""Violating the law is terrible"", that's opposition?   Antonin Scalia  But that doesn't solve the problem of having too broad an entry into this thing.  You get to the jury by just showing that she said  ""Oh, if he did that, it's terrible. ""  and then it's up to the jury all of a sudden whether that is the reason that the employer fired this person or not.  I mean, that just leaves -- lays the employer open to a lot of jury determinations that he shouldn't be subject to, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And there does not have to have been sexual harassment in the employment unit.   Antonin Scalia  So this is a law directed against expressive activity.   Antonin Scalia  Are those laws good?  I thought we had a First Amendment.   Antonin Scalia  It wouldn't be fine with me.   Antonin Scalia  What if -- what if I am indeed very much in favor of sexual harassment?  I am a world class sexual harasser, but I'm also not a liar, and I'm -- I am subpoenaed or called up by the employer in connection with this internal investigation and asked whether so-and-so harassed a particular worker.  And I'd say, yes, as a matter of fact, he did, and a good thing too.  Is that expressing opposition?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Covered by the participation clause?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, since this is a case where the--   ",06-1595
0,"Antonin Scalia  It would?  Why?  It doesn't seem so to me.  I mean, it either was or wasn't.  You're making the argument, essentially, that ""oppose"" has two quite different meanings.  You can ask somebody, you know, do you oppose the war in Iraq?  And all you're asking is what is your opinion of the war in Iraq.  Do you think it is good or bad?  But ""oppose"" is also used in a quite different sense.  He -- you say somebody opposed the war in Iraq, you mean he went out and -- and paraded against it and so forth.  And your assertion is that in this legislation, it has the latter meaning.  It just doesn't ask for your opinion about whether sexual harassment is good or bad.  It asks whether you were actively -- actively opposing it.  Now, once you adopt that position, I don't see how the fact that you -- that something that was not active opposition can be converted into active opposition by something that occurred later.  I mean, if you want to abandon your other argument, that's fine with me, but ----  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would that uncomfortable?  Say it doesn't.  I mean, I -- I don't care if you're uncomfortable with it.  Does it or doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then I don't understand your case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It isn't just a specific -- again, if I don't understand your case, it isn't just a matter of the specific practice.  Your point is it is not asking your opinion.  It is asking whether you are actively trying to eliminate it.  I think even if -- if you were asked your opinion, you know, do you -- do you oppose what, you know, what this supervisor did?  And -- and you said yes, I don't favor it, I think it's bad, I think it's a bad idea, I -- as I understand your case, that's not opposition.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I don't see how that is changed at all when you put it in the context of a specific act of harassment as opposed to putting it in the context of harassment in general.  You -- you -- if you're hiding behind the -- the defenses you've built up, it seems to me those defenses require something more than an expression of your opinion of whether it's good or bad.  Your opinion is whether it's good or bad is not opposition.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose your point would be it doesn't matter what the reason was that she didn't report it.  In order to recover here she has to have taken a public stand; and whatever the reason why she didn't, the fact is that she didn't.  Why do you get into, you know, the reason that she didn't?   Antonin Scalia  And -- and I suppose that you -- you would require the -- the opposition to be somehow a public -- a public expression of opposition.  No?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, if one political candidate says that the other one opposed the war in Iraq, do you think the other candidate could say, that's a lie?  I'm sorry, that the charge would be held to be correct if, in fact, the other candidate had never said anything about the war in Iraq, although deep in his heart he thought it was probably a bad idea.  Would you say that he opposed the war in Iraq?  I don't think so.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The implication is--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --The implication is that he came out with some public position opposing it, and that's your position as to the meaning of--   Antonin Scalia  --Why couldn't he -- I'm sorry, Chief Justice.   Antonin Scalia  I thought you were going to answer Justice Souter with the assertion that if indeed the Court wants employers to conduct these investigations, it does not want to reduce the incentive to do so.  And the rule that is urged by the other side means whenever the -- whenever the employer conducts such an investigation, any employee who is smart enough to come in and testify against -- against sexual harassment has a guaranteed job.  It is almost like -- almost like being a Federal judge.  [Laughter]  You can't be fired after that, or the employer can't fire her without opening himself up to a lawsuit under -- under this provision.  And he might win the lawsuit, but it's going to cost money.  So why -- maybe an employer would rather say, you know, I'd rather roll the dice and -- and not conduct an investigation and insulate all of my hostile employees from -- from employment actions.   Antonin Scalia  Do you get your litigation fees if you win?  If the plaintiff here loses, does she pay all the attorneys' fees that this employer has incurred on this litigation?   Antonin Scalia  So even when you win you lose.   ",06-1595
1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Shanmugam, what is the government's position as to a person who is not a repeat offender?  He commits the crime for the first-time.  Now the government says there are alternative maximums and you have to pick whichever maximum is the higher.  Why wouldn't that maximum apply to the person who commits the crime the first-time?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're adding something to the elements of the crime and in all of our cases in this field we look to the elements of the crime.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And as far as the elements are concerned, the maximum sentence for those elements you say is the sentence that would be imposed upon a repeat offender.   Antonin Scalia  Well, there was also the statute involved in the LaBonte case, where... where the statute said the Sentencing Commission  ""shall assure that the sentencing guidelines specify a sentence to a term of imprisonment at or near the maximum term authorized for categories of defendants who have certain types of prior convictions. ""   Antonin Scalia  And that did focus on the... on the nature of the defendant and not on the element of the crime.   Antonin Scalia  So it would be easy, of course, if recidivism were an element of the crime--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --for a crime which includes the act plus the recidivism?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Shanmugam, I didn't understand what you said about Congress's intent with regard to the guidelines when it passed ACCA.  You're saying Congress did not have an eye to the guidelines, but simply had an eye to the maximum sentence within which the guidelines were applicable?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Shanmugam, would you explain to me again why... why you treat the enhancement in a State guideline system differently?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me that if you get an enhancement as a ringleader it's the same thing as if you get an enhancement because you're a recidivist.  What's the difference?   Antonin Scalia  You don't think ""ringleader"" is a broad tier.   Antonin Scalia  Well, some of them have simply said, we're going to let the jury decide.  We're going to let the jury make these determinations that Apprendi says have to be made by the jury.  But they're still... they're still referred to as sentencing factors.

So you... you can say that the punishment for that defined crime is 10 years when, when the person who committed the act is a recidivist, but the act he's being punished for is the same crime.

He went on to discuss, you know, the drug gangs.  And he says, they're not going to be affected by the threat of going to prison.  They will be affected by the threat of dying.  It seemed to me he tied it very, very closely into deterrence.  And if you say that deterrence is okay for him to refer to, I don't know how there's anything left to your argument about his saying it's bigger than Weaver.   Antonin Scalia  Where?  Where does it say that?  Where does it say never mind the facts?  Let's, let's give this guy the death penalty as a Napoleon said, ""Por encourage les autres"".  You know, he said it didn't matter which, whether the general was guilty of, of cowardice or not; it would help to encourage the others to execute him.  Where is there anything like that argument here?  I don't see it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you let a person who is as guilty as William Weaver go, you're affecting not just William Weaver, you're affecting the whole war on drugs, you're affecting the... what's wrong with that?  I... I fail to see any indication here that he's telling the jury never mind the facts.  Never mind how... you know... how horrible you think the crime was.  Never mind all of the instructions that the judge gives you about aggravating factors and mitigating factors.  Forget all of that.  Kill William Weaver because it's bigger than him.  I... I just don't... I just don't see the argument.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even... even the Supreme Court cases going to the other points, they didn't... did any of them involve a separate penalty phase?  They were all just in the guilt, guilt phase of a non-capital case, weren't they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So that, so that when the prosecutor was urging particular action, he was urging the jury to find a person guilty.  He was not just urging them what penalty is better or worse.  He was saying for these reasons you should find the individual guilty.  That's quite different it seems to me from the situation in which guilt has already been established.  The trial's done.  This person is guilty, and the only thing they're arguing about is what the penalty ought to be.  I'm not sure that you can analogize, you know, from the one situation to the other in determining what kind of argument is proper.  Because in the former situation when the... if the prosecutor says this is not just about this defendant, it's about the whole society, he's urging the jury to find the person guilty.  I mean... and that's crazy.  You don't find the person guilty in order to stop drug trafficking.  But you do impose a heavier penalty in order to do that.  So I just don't, don't see the analogy from the Supreme Court cases you have.   Antonin Scalia  That's different.  Look... it could... could... would defense counsel be able to argue during the guilt phase of the trial, in an ordinary trial where there's no separate phase,  ""ladies and gentlemen of the jury, this person has a large family that's dependent on him; he's a miserable wretch. ""  ""You shouldn't find him guilt. ""  ""Is there no mercy in your heart? ""  Would he be allowed to argue that?  Of course not.  Can he argue it in a guilt phase?  Of course he can.  And it seems to me in determining what arguments the prosecution can make you have to be guided by what arguments the defense can make.  The defense can surely come in and say ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you're being called upon to kill somebody.  Do you realize what a... what a difficult, overwhelming thing that is?  And then you say the prosecution can't come in and say ladies and gentlemen, sometimes if you do your duty, you have to kill.  This is the law here.  If you find the facts this way, that's your duty.  I... I... I think you're, you're taking hard cases very much out of context by applying cases that relate to the guilt phase, to a very special procedure that we've set up in capital cases which is called the guilt... uh, the penalty phase.   Antonin Scalia  The question has been switched here, Counsel.  The question before us is not whether it was wrong, even if you answer there's plenty of Supreme Court precedent, even though none on these particular facts, to convince me that he shouldn't have said it.  That's not the question before us.  The question before us is whether it violates fundamental unfairness, whether it's wrong to such an extent that it invalidates the whole prosecution and... and sentence.  That's quite a different question.  I can acknowledge, yeah, the prosecutor, you know, shouldn't do it.  But that doesn't lead me to the, automatically to the conclusion that the Supreme Court jurisprudence shows that this so violates fundamental unfairness that the, that the verdict has to be set aside.   Antonin Scalia  Well, serve him right?  I mean, is that--   Antonin Scalia  --How do you answer the argument, fight for life, always fight for life?  How do you answer that argument, except by saying: Ladies and gentlemen, sometimes, sometimes it's your duty to vote for death?  How else would you answer that argument?   Antonin Scalia  And was that this habeas?  Then he filed a subsequent habeas or what?   ",06-313X

Antonin Scalia  Can that be read just to apply to any, any State permits that... that violate Clean Water requirements?  As opposed to upland habitat which... which might be affected?   Antonin Scalia  Well, how do you feel--   Antonin Scalia  --I thought that those are in place.  As I understood Mr. Kneedler to say that that's exactly what they, what they continue to do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that has nothing to do, as the Chief was about to say before I interrupted him, that has nothing to do with, with whether they have to issue the NPDES authorization.   Antonin Scalia  Could I get back to the memorandum of agreement that you've called our attention to on page 260?  I read that paragraph, and I don't see anything in it that imposes any obligation whatever on the State.  It is just a description of what... what EPA is, is going to do.   Antonin Scalia  The same kind of consultation with Fish and Wildlife that, that Mr. Kneedler described to us.   Antonin Scalia  But this is talking about consultation when the permit is... the permit application is issued.  Not consultation at the, at the stage of approving the State plan.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know what you're talking about.  Funding of what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How does the government fund it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you... you have other... let's assume that I disagree with you on whether they could withhold approval of the NPDES transfer.  Even so, I think you... the point you're making now is that apart from that approval, there were other discretionary actions taken here, one of which is this funding; and another one of which, I believe, is whether... never mind the MOAs, but... I have it written down here, one of the other ones.  Oh, whether existing permits would be transferred to State authority or not.  And that is apparently discretionary and can be... what do we do about that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, that's not enough.  Why wouldn't... what would lead you to believe that it wouldn't... that the same would not happen when the State issued the permits?  I mean, you have to show some reason why we don't trust Arizona to do what the Federal government's doing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well then, you have to establish jeopardy.  You have to establish jeopardy.  And the mere fact that you're giving it to a State which Congress has been willing to trust with implementing this law is not enough to show that there's jeopardy.  Prima facie, we would expect Arizona to do the right thing.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand that answer.  The Chief Justice is asking, if EPA cannot do it itself, how is it creating any jeopardy in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't do it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, if you assume that EPA can't protect these plant species under its legislation, what harm is there in transferring the authority to somebody else who can't protect it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  By coercing, by coercing the States to sign those agreements on pain of not getting NPDES authority?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What do they do then?  They just whistle and this comes forth?  States don't sign stuff just, just for the sake of it.   Antonin Scalia  It's your position, not the Federal Government's position.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Where is (e)(2)?  Is it produced in these materials.  I got (e)(1); I don't have (e)(2).  I don't really like talking about a section I don't have in front of me.   Antonin Scalia  Ah.   Antonin Scalia  That's one thing about this case I'm sure about.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  That's right.   Antonin Scalia  It's easy to see why the only cases you have relate to (e)(2) rather than (e)(1).  (E)(2) which we don't have in the materials, but I have gotten a copy of it.  And (e)(1) says that the Secretary ""may"" abate the assessment of all or any part.  And those cases that denied it said this is discretionary; he doesn't have to.  (E)(2) on the other hand, interest abated with respect to erroneous refund check, says the Secretary ""shall"" abate the assessment.  So really, (e)(2) doesn't... doesn't do you any good at all with respect to whether there was a cause of action before--  (h) was adopted.   Antonin Scalia  I see.  What you're say is that cases that used to be bringable under (e)(2) would now be bringable only under (h) which would in effect be an implicit repeal of (e)(2).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  At least as far as suits elsewhere than in the tax court.   Antonin Scalia  Mr.... Mr. Redding, let me come back to the phantom (e)(2) which we have finally traced down.   Antonin Scalia  I am not sure that (h) would impliedly repeal (e)(2), because (e)(2) is mandatory.  There isn't any question under (e)(2) whether there has been an abuse of discretion.  There is no discretion.  It is mandatory to the extent that the Administrative Procedure Act would govern (e)(2), it would be for a violation of law not for abuse of discretion.  So when (h) says the tax court shall have jurisdiction to determine whether the Secretary's failure to abate interest was an abuse of discretion, I would take that to apply only to (e)(1), which says the Secretary may abate and not to (e)(2) which says the Secretary shall abate.  There is no question of... of discretion in (e)(2) at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It was a pretty good argument, I thought.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What about those other sections, (c) and (d), which say the Secretary is authorized?  Have there been cases which, which said that you could sue for, for his failure to make use of that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's the same as with (e)?   Antonin Scalia  As with (e)(1).   Antonin Scalia  Who said that?   ",06-376X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Did (h) apply to (e)(2) as well as to (e)(1)?  Does it apply only to discretionary abatement provisions?   Antonin Scalia  So what happens with (e)(2)?  You use the pay and sue provisions?   Antonin Scalia  I don't, I don't even think it's technically correct.  How is it an abuse of discretion?  He has no discretion.  He must do it.  How could you say he has abused his discretion?  What discretion?   Antonin Scalia  But he doesn't even know what his tax liability is, especially in a partnership situation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He makes the partnership calculation, it goes to the IRS, and then they figure out what the tax is.  And meanwhile, you know, the interest is running.   Antonin Scalia  This is quite a different argument.  You're saying, you know, he should have paid the full tax in the first place, not he could have paid the interest that he knew was accruing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I didn't understand that.  Say that again?  There's no abatement for the interest that accrues until you're notified of what the--   Antonin Scalia  --The next thing you know, they will enact a progressive income tax.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Is there a you cannot enter the courthouse provision here, or is it... as I understand your case, it is that it remains discretionary with the Secretary with respect to people who have more money, but it is not discretionary with respect to people who have less money.   Antonin Scalia  So one has a cause of--  action and the other doesn't have a cause of action.  And the difference you're making between the two is you're permitting the Secretary to waive the interest with respect to the rich.  You're requiring him to do it with respect to the poor.  Isn't that the difference?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's permissive, not mandatory.   Antonin Scalia  But he doesn't have--   Antonin Scalia  --Wait a minute.  They are not really saying that.  They're saying it's totally within your discretion.  You can't possibly abuse your discretion when you have total discretion.  They're just saying, you know, do it if you want to do it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I would not concede, as you seem to have, that the consequence of (h) is simply to open the door.  I think the category of decisions that are committed to agency discretion by law within the meaning of the APA are agency decisions as to which the term ""abuse of discretion"" makes no sense.  There's no such thing.  It is totally committed to agency discretion.  It's only other decisions that are not committed to agency discretion by law where you... where the discretion can be abused.  If you look at it that way, it isn't a matter of closing the door to one category and opening it to another; it's a matter of different substantive laws applying to the two, to the two classes.  Anyway, I choose to look at it that way.  You can talk--   ",06-376X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Did he say, ""for example"", with regard to the quotation that Justice Ginsburg mentioned?  I didn't recall that he said for example.   Antonin Scalia  Well, aren't we obliged under AEDPA to give deference to any reasonable conclusion from the facts?   Antonin Scalia  So even if it is just a conclusion, AEDPA still applies to it unless it's a totally unreasonable conclusion, right?   Antonin Scalia  Of course there is on demeanor.  I mean, I suppose, to begin with, is it not the case that the burden is on the habeas applicant to show that demeanor did not make the difference?  It's the burden on him to show that it was an unreasonable determination.   Antonin Scalia  And secondly, he could present such evidence if he showed that there was absolutely no ambiguity in what the person's statements said, so that demeanor could not have made a difference.  But in a case where the statements are seemingly contradictory or arguably contradictory, demeanor is very relevant and it's the burden, it seems to me, of the Petitioner to show that demeanor wasn't what made the difference.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, you... you... you insist that he come out and say in so many words, I am going to be an unreliable juror.  That's... that's not the way it happens.  And somebody has to evaluate whether indeed he's shading the truth a little bit and whether, in fact, he will be impaired in his service.  And some of these... some of these answers suggest that.  And it, it is not an easy call to simply say well, you know, unless he comes out and admits yes, I'm going to be a lousy juror, nobody is going to say that.   Antonin Scalia  Why... why was there no objection if this was so clear?  If this fellow had answered all the questions the way you expect a, a good juror to answer, why was there no objection when the State moved to dismiss him?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's fine.  But, but competent counsel knows that getting something overturned on appeal is a lot harder than getting it done right the first time.  And he also knows that if you raise an objection, you're more likely get it done right.  I can't imagine why if he thought this person was not properly strikeable he would have sat... indeed not just sat silent but said I have no objection.  It just doesn't make any sense.   Antonin Scalia  Well, he made the same mistake the judge did.  I wonder who else was there that made the same mistake.  I mean, you know, it makes you think maybe, maybe the judge was right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where... where are you quoting from?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  75 of the--   Antonin Scalia  --How many days did this take?   Antonin Scalia  17 days?  Less than one a day.  That's pretty good.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but he said for one of the other witnesses, I just don't... I don't believe him.  And if that had been his problem here, he presumably would have said the same thing.   Antonin Scalia  Not if there's no opposing objection by defense counsel.  When there was, and when part of his reason for granting the motion to strike the juror was demeanor, he mentioned demeanor.   Antonin Scalia  Of what law?   Antonin Scalia  Well, he said that, but elsewhere he sort of indicated that he couldn't consider it unless it were a situation in which this person would be able to commit the crime again.   Antonin Scalia  They did indicate that unless that was the situation, he wouldn't consider imposing the death penalty.  I think that's precisely what they indicated.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Grossman, is there any reason why, in principle, the elements for a cause of action under 10b-5 have to be the same as the elements for a cause of action by the agency under 10(b)?  I mean, we, we created this, this cause of action.  It's not set forth in the statute, although other private causes of action are.  If it's our creation, couldn't we sensibly limit it so that, for example, schemes can be attacked by the SEC, but schemes do not form the basis for private attorney general's actions?  You need actual conveyance of a misrepresentation to the injured party.  Is there any reason why we couldn't do that?   Antonin Scalia  Intended or known?  I mean, I don't see... what's in it for Scientific-Atlanta to defraud the shareholders?  Is it enough that they just knew it would be used for that purpose?   Antonin Scalia  Well, when you say ""in furtherance of"", you... you import intent.  They didn't care what Charter was going to do with it, but they pretty well knew that what Charter was going to do was to make its books look better.  Would that be enough?   Antonin Scalia  That's what I thought your position was.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it's not an intent necessarily.  It's just knowledge.   Antonin Scalia  Sure.  After trial... you know, after trial which causes your stock to tank, you may indeed be able to show that you didn't know it was going to be used for that purpose.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's exactly the thing they told them to separate.   Antonin Scalia  What other reason?   Antonin Scalia  I understand what you're saying.  It seems to me that when you say that they can't be connected, you're saying precisely, you can't be bartering the advertising revenue for the increased money that you're paying.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But don't aiders and abettors have to have that purpose as well?  What distinguishes... what distinguishes the liability that you propose from aider and abettor liability?   Antonin Scalia  So any aiding-and-abetting through a deceptive act makes you a principal?  Is that it?  You can't be an aider and abettor by committing or enabling a deceptive act without becoming a principal?   Antonin Scalia  You cannot?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but... but if you do, or if you should have known, you are not an aider and abettor.  You are automatically a principal.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If I'm entirely innocent, and I don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You see, I really thought the difference was that the principal is the one who makes the deceptive representation and obtains money from it.  The aider and abettor is the person who facilitates or enables that deceptive representation, which is what we have here.

Antonin Scalia  I thought it was consumer welfare.   Antonin Scalia  And I thought some consumers would prefer more service at a higher price.   Antonin Scalia  So the mere fact that it would increase prices doesn't prove anything.  It doesn't prove that it's serving consumer welfare.  If, in fact, it's giving the consumer a choice of more service at a somewhat higher price, that would enhance consumer welfare, so long as there are competitive products at a lower price, wouldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  So I don't know why, why we should have to focus our entire attention on whether it's going to... going to produce higher prices or not.  The market out there has different goods at different prices which have different qualities that attract different consumers.   ",06-480X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Is that right?  I mean, You really think that antitrust policy means when... any arrangement that produces a higher price is bad?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, a lot of consumers want, you know, extended warranties.  They want show rooms where they can go and look at things.  All of which costs more money.  And where you can not have resale price maintenance the customers... or you have the free rider problem.  The customers shop at the place that has the big show room, likes at all the product there, and goes and buys it from somebody else who has not incurred that expense.  Now, I just don't think that all the customers want is cheap.  I think they want other things besides cheap.  I think they want service.  I think they want selection.  I think they want the ability to view goods and so forth.  Why do you discount all of those things?   Antonin Scalia  Well, they aren't available.  This company thought that it could provide higher service if it could assure its retailers that they would not be undercut by people who are not providing that kind of service.   Antonin Scalia  I don't, I don't know that there's no question about that.  There's certainly no question that this company was successful in breaking into a difficult market with its strategy of assuring its retailers a cushion so that they could provide the service.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  I mean, if it was really the case that they were going to be losing, losing profits, I think they would have been here.  I mean, we talk about the Wal-Marts and the Targets.  They're not here on amicus briefs because they're... what they're selling is cheap.  They are selling price, and people who want low price and for whom that's of value above all other things are going to continue to go to those stores.  So they're not going to be harmed by the fact that some manufacturers want to provide not just the low price... of course, they'll try to keep the price as low as possible... but service.  I just don't see what, what harm can possibly come, so long as there's no market dominance, from allowing some people to make their money on service and... rather than cheap price.   Antonin Scalia  No, but it's a totally... I cannot imagine why a horizontal conspiracy among dealers could ever produce consumer welfare.  It will be a horizontal conspiracy to get more money out of the consumer; but whereas the manufacturer who wants to impose resale price maintenance, his interest isn't to give the retailer as much... more money than the retailer is now making.  He's going to try to keep their margin just as low as it ever was, so that he can sell as many of his products as possible consistent with his desire to sell his product by attaching to it more service, better warranty, more showrooms, whatever.  You know, horizontal conspiracy, the incentives are entirely different.  When you're dealing with a manufacturer, it seems to me his incentive is still to keep the price as low as possible consistent with the additional good that he wants to give consumers to attract those consumers to his product.   Antonin Scalia  Well, if that's the case and if that makes a difference, the rule of reason would allow you to make that argument.  But you... but you want to say it's bad across the board for everybody.  If indeed there's something peculiar about this case, the rule of reason would allow you to argue that.   Antonin Scalia  I don't suppose there's any... I don't suppose there's any way to protect against the fallout to the consumer, is there?  I mean if indeed, if indeed a store presses on a consumer a product that's more expensive than what he needs or... and what he wants, is this a real argument against this, that there's some stupid consumers whose can be conned?  I mean, whatever rule we adopt, that's going to be the situation.   Antonin Scalia  You're assuming that the... that the retailer has a higher margin on the resale price good.  Why do you assume that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He's only going to be given the thing if he does the kind of additional service that the manufacturer wants.  That's the whole purpose of it.  And the manufacturer is going to try to keep his margin just as low as he can consistent with the... you know... consistent with selling as many products as he can.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure it's often the case.  Give me some other examples where you can achieve the same industry-wide effect unilaterally.   Antonin Scalia  Were they relying on Dr. Miles or were they relying on us?  That's the question.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They left the situation where it was, which is that the antitrust law is as determined by this Court, and we had shown our willingness to update the antitrust law when sound economic doctrine suggests is necessary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But some manufacturers want their product associated with excellent service, high warranty, and all of that.  And there is no way to get that uniformly for that product without this kind of agreement.   Antonin Scalia  I guess Congress changed its mind then.   Antonin Scalia  I find it hard to believe that.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Ms. Seitz, I'd be curious to get your reaction to one of the points made by opposing counsel, which is that there were really sort of two different pieces of litigation at issue here, that it was an as-applied challenge that produced the preliminary injunction, and what was rejected in the final decision was a facial challenge.  Is there anything to that?   Antonin Scalia  It is not a determination, is it, that they have a right to hold a demonstration?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It is just a determination that we don't know at this point enough to say that you don't have a right.

He faces a horrible of having to pay for his own litigation, just like the rest of us do.

Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  How can that be, that a preliminary injunction resolves a dispositive question of law?  Does that happen?   Patricia A. Millett  --Well it happened... it happened in this Court and... and... and there were dissenters.  But there... it happened in this Court's case in the Thornburgh case.  It came up on a preliminary injunction.  This Court determined there were no disputed questions of fact and it was only a contest of law what the Court said is that when they have done that we can make dispositive ruling of law.  But I think that's an unusual situation and what's critical is that when--   Antonin Scalia  But it wasn't the issuance of the preliminary injunction that resolved it, it was the appeal to this Court where we... we resolved a question of law.   Patricia A. Millett  --This Court resolved a question of law on the merits.  The debate in that opinion between the majority and the dissents was that the... the dissent said majority should only decide whether it was an abuse of discretion to issue the preliminary injunction.  And, I mean... it, it, it can become sort of the same thing if an error in law is necessarily an abuse of discretion, but when... when a superior court's made a definitive--   Antonin Scalia  The point is you wouldn't mind putting that on a resume, that you have been subjected to a preliminary injunction.   Patricia A. Millett  --No--   Antonin Scalia  It's not a black mark on your name, is it?   Patricia A. Millett  --No.   Antonin Scalia  You haven't violated any Federal law.   Patricia A. Millett  This is a case in point.   Antonin Scalia  They are voluntary, these settlements, aren't they?  So you could at least say that the innocent person who gets stuck with attorney's fees for settling gets what he asked for, right?  It's voluntary.   Patricia A. Millett  --Well, that's what I tried to explain to Justice Breyer.   ",06-531X

I mean, they prevailed.  They have a TRO here, something of value.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's just prevails.  If you think TRO wouldn't qualify.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even though you lost on the preliminary injunction?  The fees that you reasonably expended in seeking a preliminary injunction, even though you lost, you'd be able to charge to the other side?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes or no?  I think you can answer yes or no.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  No.  How much of it related to the preliminary... you mean anything that related only to the preliminary injunction you would be denied?   Antonin Scalia  I don't know what you mean, if the decision on what?  On the preliminary injunction?   Antonin Scalia  Is repudiated by the district... how is it repudiated?  What do you envision?   Antonin Scalia  In a later case, you mean?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought the hypothetical was different, was, the case proceeds to final judgment on the merits; and at that point... okay... at that point, the issue of whether the preliminary injunction was valid or not comes up, not in the direct appeal from the preliminary injunction.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Assume you win on the merits.   Antonin Scalia  That included a screen.   Antonin Scalia  But your people didn't want a screen.   Antonin Scalia  So they didn't get what they asked for.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's only because, I guess the other side didn't take the action that they could have taken if they didn't... if they didn't apply the screen.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did they conduct the demonstration with a screen or without a screen?   Antonin Scalia  Did they conduct the demonstration with or without a screen?   Antonin Scalia  And since they didn't use the screen, the State was not prohibited from arresting them; is that correct?   Antonin Scalia  So they did not get what they asked for.  Mainly a prohibition against the state interfering with the kind of demonstration they wanted, which was one without a screen.  You say they didn't get that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The state had no problem with that.  In the past the State had let them do that, as long as they had the screen.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But see, it's so extraordinary for somebody to make the other side pay for his attorney.  We don't even do that... we don't even do that for guilty people when they... when the other side wins.  So they have violated the law.  We still don't make them pay the other side's attorney's fees.  Now you want us to pay your client's attorney's fees even though you're not dealing with a guilty party, because ultimately the court found no, there really, this person didn't violate the law.  That is... you know, that's double indemnity.  I mean, it's multiplying the extraordinary departure from our usual practice, which is that each side pays his own.  It's one thing to say well, if you're a bad actor, in certain circumstances, civil rights cases, we'll make you pay the other side.  But it's another thing to say if you're... if you're not a bad actor in a civil rights case but you're unlucky enough to get hit with a preliminary injunction, we'll make you pay for the other side.  It just grates that that... it ain't fair.   Antonin Scalia  I assume that Congress doesn't often do things that are grossly unfair.  And if there are various interpretations, one of which is not grossly unfair, that's the one we should--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, you surely wouldn't say that the fact that the other side never shows up means that you can't get your attorney's fees.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're a prevailing party whether there's an adversary on the other side or not.   INTERRUPTING ",06-531X

1,"Antonin Scalia  So you say there are two factors which still exert pressure to settle.  One is that you don't have to bear the burden of showing that you conform with the national contingency plan, and second, that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --you insulate yourself from contribution suits by other people.   Antonin Scalia  Do you rely at all on... in 9607(a)(b)?  It says any other necessary costs of response incurred by any other person.  Does the word ""any"" add anything to your case?  Do you think it urges us to give the broadest possible interpretation to other person?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Other necessary costs?   Antonin Scalia  Now you say this very language that's in 107 now had been interpreted unanimously by the courts?   Antonin Scalia  So that part of your case is that, is to say that it's limited by 113 is to say that there's been an implied repeal.   Antonin Scalia  Unless all those cases were wrong.   Antonin Scalia  So it's not just a legislative history point you're making, it's not just a point as to what Congress's expectations were.  It's also... it's also a point that relates to implicit repeal.   Antonin Scalia  And if the Government's only strong point is that 113 is meant to coerce settlement, and 113 didn't exist before, then it must be very clear that previously 107 did give them a cause of action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No acorns on the other side.   Antonin Scalia  Why wouldn't the States prefer to proceed, to force people to proceed under 113, so that the States would have, you know, a hand in deciding how the cleanup should go?  I don't...

Couldn't the same thing have been said in Smith?   Antonin Scalia  So the issue in Smith was weapon versus nonweapon, and that's not what you're arguing here?

As... as your opponent pointed out, this section does not focus on the individual.  It focuses on the firearm, simply for... for confiscation of the firearm.  And, therefore, it suffices if either side intended it to be used.  It doesn't have to be the recipient who intended it to be used even though it's a receipt crime.  It was intended to be used by the other side.  Wouldn't that make sense?   Antonin Scalia  What page is that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe they were doubtful about whether the ""possession"" thing applies here.  I don't know.  Possesses a firearm in furtherance of the crime... I mean, the crime has been completed by the time the... the person who is receiving the gun has possession of it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's hard to say it's in furtherance of the crime when the crime is over once he gets it.  His possession is not in furtherance of the crime, it seems to me.  It's the other person's possession that's in furtherance of the crime.  He possesses it so he can turn it over, which is the crime.

But I find it... you're hanging your case upon the proposition that there is a difference between domestic service employment and employed in domestic service employment.  Wow.  You know, I just don't see how there's any difference in those two at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're saying we have to find some difference no matter how imaginative the difference might be.  If there were a difference, I'm not sure it's the difference that you're arguing for.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask you what your proposal is with regard to the contradictory regulations, 552.3 and 552.  --what is it, 109?  I think they are contradictory.  Now, the Agency has come up with a solution.  We will interpret the former quite unrealistically to mean something that it doesn't seem to us to say but... you know... close enough for government work.  What is your solution for solving the inconsistency?  Are both of the regulations bad?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's your other reason?   Antonin Scalia  Because of employed and domestic employment versus--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --domestic service?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you're getting into arguments now that are not about the regulation but they're about the statute.  I'm assuming that we have regulations that are entitled to deference.  And you have two regulations that are conflicting.  Now, how do you decide which one prevails?  Counsel for the other side says the specific governs the general, certainly an ancient prescription.  Counsel also says that this is an agency regulation.  The agency is given great deference in the interpretation of it own regulations.  And even if the agency had said well, you know, they do conflict, we admit it, they totally conflict, we won't even try to reinterpret 552.3, we think that's the one that's wrong, why wouldn't we accept their statement to that effect?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's statutory.  I just want to focus on the regulation arguments, not the statutory--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --They aren't unambiguous.  They contradict each other.  The agency has to do something about it, and here the agency made a choice.  Even if I assume the choice was, we're going to disregard 552.3, we're going to strike out those words, they were the mistake.  One or the other had to be the mistake.  We decided it was this one.  Why shouldn't we take their word on it?   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but interpretive regulations are in other areas wholly valid before the courts and entitled to Chevron deference, at least if they're adopted by notice and comment rulemaking.  You know, we have nothing, what should I say, subordinate about interpretive regulations.  In fact, probably most of the significant regulations of the most important agencies are interpretive regulations.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that you say it creates two types, but there is no indication that it intended one type of authority to be entitled to less respect from the courts than the other.  What do you rely on for that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where is the proposition that an interpretive regulation is somehow not a full-fledged binding regulation?   Antonin Scalia  They're different but not necessarily of different... entitled to different respect from the courts.  A defined... what is it, define and delimit?  These are regulations that don't even purport to be an interpretation of any language in the statute, but the use of authority given to the agency to cut out certain areas, to say the... this rule won't apply to companies over this... that can't possibly be an interpretation of the statute.  So Congress says we're going to give the agency that authority.  In addition, of course, we're going to give this agency the authority that every other agency has, which is to interpret... interpret the language of the statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Skidmore was before a rather significant case called Chevron.   Antonin Scalia  You mean we're going to divide all administrative law now into those... those regulations... those provisions that were adopted by Congress pre-Chevron and those adopted by Congress post-Chevron, and for the ones adopted pre-Chevron we're going to treat regulation as essentially suggestions by the agency which we give Skidmore deference to, and the ones after Chevron, we're going to treat differently.  Do you have any case of ours that suggests something like that, which seems to me a very strange manner of proceeding?   INTERRUPTING ",06-593X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Which is what the statute says, and so how could the statute possibly be unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the Constitution... I mean, the statute has within itself a Speech or Debate Clause exception.  Now, I guess you can argue that a lower court might not accurately provide the Speech or Debate Clause protection that is due, but that, that doesn't meet, it seems to me, the, the jurisdictional requirement that, that the constitutionality of the statute be called into question.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that doesn't comply with Section 412, which says that an appeal may be taken directly to the Supreme Court from  ""any interlocutory or final judgment decree of order of court upon the constitutionality of any provision of the Act. ""  Now, and as-applied challenge is not a challenge to the constitutionality of the provision.   Antonin Scalia  My problem is, it's extraordinary.  We have very few direct appeal cases any more and I, I am loathe to read Section 412 as embracing a decision by a court that a particular use of this statute was unconstitutional.  You say it was, the statute was unconstitutional as applied.  That's sloppy language.  It really means that this application of the statute or the use of the statute for this purpose was unconstitutional.  I think that's something different from saying that it was an order of the court upon the constitutionality of any provision.  Which provision of this Act has been held to be unconstitutional?   Antonin Scalia  Which... but it hasn't been held to be unconstitutional.  It's perfectly constitutional.  You're just saying it can't be used in this particular case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, read the language.  It says  ""The constitutionality of any provision of this act. ""  not  ""the constitutionality of the application of any provision of this act. ""   Antonin Scalia  What... what had the lower court held?  It isn't a question of what we held; it's a question of what the lower court had held.  Had the lower court held that it was unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, but that can mean... you can always dispose of a, of a facial challenge by just saying we don't have to reach the facial question; we can decide it on an as applied question.  But in order to get here in the first place, it has to be a challenge to the constitutionality of a provision of the Act.   Antonin Scalia  Well, he didn't do exclusively that stuff anyway.  We can certainly all agree on that.  And why isn't it sufficient that when any of those issues are, his activities in any of those capacities are sought to be introduced into evidence, anyone tries to contradict them, then you can bring in your Speech or Debate Clause objection?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why is the whole suit precluded?   Antonin Scalia  Maybe he was the 23rd self.  [Laughter]  I think you have to figure out when he was hired.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There's never an office.  I mean, I think the office is just a fictional construct anyway.  So what you say now has nothing to do with whether, whether this current Senator has, has departed from the scene.  Even if he were still on the scene, there still wouldn't be any such thing as that office.  It's just a fiction, and it would always be a suit against Congress, and so you say none of these suits can ever be brought.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't it a waiver of sovereign immunity when you set up a system that envisions a suit which will be paid off by the Senate?  Why isn't that a waiver of sovereign immunity?   Antonin Scalia  A physical, a physical office, yes.  I mean, they didn't work in the hallway.  But their staff salary was not paid out of their, quote, ""office"".  It was paid out of the Senate.   Antonin Scalia  Setting it is quite different from paying it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Senator sets it and the Senate pays it.   Antonin Scalia  Right.  The Senate puts a limit on how much money it will spend for a particular Senator.  That's all that amounts to.  It doesn't hand him the money.  It's still the Senate's money, isn't it?  And what the Senate says is each office will have so much of a call upon our fund and no more.

What social value do you find in being able to lie about the content of what you're offering to somebody else?  You say somehow if you're lying about it, oh, well, then the First Amendment protects that.  I would think if you're lying about it, it is clearer than ever the First Amendment doesn't protect it.  There is no social value in protecting lies.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it depends on what they're lying about.  If they're lying about the value of what they're selling, you know, it's fraud.

Antonin Scalia  Are you complaining about the degree of the penalty?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You seem to think we are punishing the lying.  I don't read the statute as punishing the lying.   Antonin Scalia  You'd be punished even if it were true.  What is being punished is the pandering.  You are the one that's bringing in the lying example.  You say, my goodness, even if the pandering is a lie, pandering is pandering.  And I don't see why there is some special protection against pandering when in addition to pandering, you're lying.  Maybe you ought to get extra penalty.  [Laughter]  But, in fact, the statute does not provide extra penalty.  It just provides a penalty for pandering.  And I don't know why it's a good defense to that to say, oh, I was actually lying.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --All of those verbs only become pandering when they are attached to explicit sexual material.  When you promote explicit sex, you are pandering.  I mean, the word pandering does have a sexual connotation.  I... I think... I had thought it was accepted that we have here a statute that's directed against pandering.

I am less concerned about the fact that the candidate can't say I'm the... I'm the no-taxes candidate, than I am about the fact that he can associate himself with the Republican Party or the Democratic Party on the ballot and that party has no opportunity on the ballot to say, we have nothing to do with this person.  That it seems to me is a great disadvantage to the parties.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not talking about a First Amendment forced association.  I'm talking about an association for purposes of making this a fair election at which the parties have an opportunity to nominate and support their own candidates.  And what this system creates is a ballot in which an individual can associate himself with the Republican Party, but on the ballot the Republican Party is unable to dissociate itself from that candidate.   Antonin Scalia  Will, will it say whether the party that is preferred likes this candidate?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think you can say yes or no to that.  Will it say whether the party for which he expresses a preference claims or disclaims him?   Antonin Scalia  Please answer yes or no.

Iis there any, what should I say, truth investigation by the State of Washington?  Suppose a candidate who has been a Democrat all his life, has run for office as a Democrat, agrees with all the positions of the Democratic Party, chooses to state on the ballot: I prefer the Republican Party.

Antonin Scalia  I don't think it's enough that... that there's no claim of party endorsement.  There is a claim of associating himself with the party, and if he associates himself with the party it seems to me the party should be able to disassociate itself from him.  And I think it harms the party not to permit that.   Antonin Scalia  General McKenna, I'm interested in how this new system meshes with the otherwise quite partisan nature of Washington's election laws.  For example, the major political parties have a certain... certain benefits that are not given to minor parties, and the major parties are determined on the basis of obtaining more than a certain percentage, I think it's 5 percent, in a statewide election.  How are you going to figure out whether the Republican Party has, has gotten more than 5 percent when all you have is somebody who expresses a preference for the Republican Party, although he's not really a Republican?

That is to say, have we held that the Constitution itself imposes certain restrictions?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I want a case where the State did not impose the restriction and it was up to us to decide whether the State could do that or not, but rather the State said the party can do whatever it wants, and we have disallowed what the party itself chose under no compulsion from the State--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --on the basis of some constitutional principle apart from the Equal Protection Clause--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --or the Thirteenth amendment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, the parties are not protesting in this case, are they?   Antonin Scalia  If and when that situation arises, I suppose we can... we can decide it.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, it's also used in the phrase ""knowing and willfully"".  That appears in several other parts of the statute, and that wouldn't make any sense if the only meaning of willful is knowing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In one formulation or another, but it combines the two words, knowing and willful.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You mean willfully alone?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where... where it... where it means what you think it means, which is knowingly, that does not mean knowing the facts?  If you mistake the facts and are laboring under a misimpression of the facts, you have nonetheless willfully violated the law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How about reckless disregard?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose there is a fair ground for believing it was lawful.  Lawyers are in disagreement, but in fact, I believe the lawyers who say it is unlawful, and I nonetheless go ahead and do it.  Is that a willful violation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But I think I'm violating.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm a better lawyer than my advisors.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Would you look to the subjective intent of the actor at all?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or would you just look to the outcome and say, well, you know, it was a close question, so even if the actor indeed thought he was in violation, it was a close question; it's okay?   Antonin Scalia  I must say that... that is not the normal meaning of willful, willfully violating the law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're changing it to mean willfully, willfully and blatantly violating the law.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, if I know that what I'm doing is in violation of the law, even if it's a close question, it seems to me I am willfully violating the law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How do you fit, how do you fit that within the language of the statute?  Is it, I fail... you're a first-time customer and I fail to give you a, you know, a break that maybe you could have had.  Is it a denial or cancellation of insurance?  No.  Is it an increase in, an increase in any charge for insurance?  Is it a reduction or other adverse or unfavorable change in the terms of coverage or in the amount of any insurance?  I find it hard to shoehorn your case into that language.   Patricia A. Millett  Well, to begin with, that may be why Petitioners' position here certainly was not reckless and the Ninth Circuit erred.  But we do think that the statutory language read as a whole supports this.  It could be a denial of a particular term in an insurance contract.  But you have to look at... it's important to understand you look--   Antonin Scalia  I read the term as, as one of the Justices here does, not referring to the rate.  The earlier part refers to the rate.  An increase in any charge for, that's the rate.  And then it speaks of change in the terms of coverage.  I mean, that is, you know, whether it covers hurricanes, or in the amount of the insurance, whether you're insured for--   Patricia A. Millett  --Or it could be a reduction in the terms.  I mean, these things are statutory construction issues to be litigated, and the important issue here... and they are presented in this case.  They're to be litigated and the important issue is that when there is fair debate about these issues insurance companies will not be held to be willfully violating the statute if they got the answer wrong.  But I think on the, on the substantive question, it's important to read ""adverse action"" in light of, if I could just finish the sentence, in light of the definition of when a notice is required to be issued, which turns upon the content of the information in the report.

1,"Antonin Scalia  What do you mean by... let's get straight by what we mean by ""in actuality conflicted"".  Isn't the fiduciary who has a financial interest in actuality conflicted?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And aren't we talking in this case always about fiduciaries who are in actuality conflicted.   Antonin Scalia  No.  That's, that's a conflicted fiduciary who allows the conflict to warp its judgment.  But the conflict exists whether you, whether you give it effect or not.   Antonin Scalia  So let's call that a conflicted fiduciary, somebody who has two loyalties, whether or not he allows the one loyalty to distort his judgment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you're saying it doesn't make any difference.  You say you should take it into account, but if it was a reasoned decision, which is the test whether or not he's a fiduciary, if it's a reasoned decision the fact that he's a fiduciary makes no difference, right?  Isn't that what you're saying?   Antonin Scalia  It does make a difference then.  What was a reasoned decision for someone who doesn't have a conflict becomes an unreasoned decision simply by reason of the fact that he has a conflict?   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Posner, it seems to me that that ought to be looked at with suspicion, whether or not the person making the decision has a conflict.  I mean that smells bad or doesn't smell bad, as you say, either way.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I am still... listen, I know that we're responsible for this because we said it in Firestone.  We said that a conflict of interest should be weighed as a factor.  If that means anything, it seems to me it means that sometimes that weight will make the difference.  So at least sometimes... but you're not willing to admit that... at least sometimes you would say, oh, yes, this is a reasonable decision and had this decision been made by a fiduciary without a conflict, it would be perfectly okay because it's reasonable.  That's the test.  However, since this fiduciary has a conflict, what was a reasonable decision, whoof, the added weight, it becomes an unreasonable decision.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that what you mean by giving it some weight?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So a perfectly reasonable decision becomes unreasonable simply because you have a conflict?   INTERRUPTING ",06-923X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Dictum.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What I don't like about the dictum is I don't know what it means.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think it's lovely to say weigh it as a factor, it gets the case off our docket and it's fine.  But what does it mean?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does it mean that a perfectly reasonable decision that is within the discretion... I mean this plan says that Metlife will have... knowing that it will have the conflict, that they will make the decisions and so long as they are not arbitrary, they are valid.  Now, let's take a perfectly reasonable decision.  It is not arbitrary.  Does giving weight to the existence of the conflict which the settlor of the plan expected to exist, does giving weight to that mean that what was reasonable becomes unreasonable?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it doesn't mean that, then it means nothing.   Antonin Scalia  Trust law doesn't say.  Trust law does not establish a different standard of judicial review for the conflicted trustee.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --But you say that one of the things that can make it unreasonable is the mere fact that there exists this... this conflict.   Antonin Scalia  That renders what is a perfectly reasonable decision unreasonable.  I--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand that.  In very... what kind of a standard is that, ""in very close cases""?  How is... how are you going to review a court?  I mean, give it some weight in very close cases?  It slops over.  This is not a standard.  I don't know... I don't know what you're telling the courts to do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't mind reasonableness and I don't mind abuse of discretion.  But you're telling me that even when the reasonableness standard is met, if there is this conflict, if it's close... how close is close?  You... suddenly it flops over the edge.  I mean, you know, close to the out... it's... it's beautiful art, but I don't understand how it turns into law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think you're at all saying that it's the same standard of review.  You keep saying that, and your friend said it, but it's not the same standard of review.  You say it's still the reasonableness standard of review, but then you say, however, the mere fact of the existence of the conflict does at the edges make unreasonable what used to be reasonable.  That is a different standard of review.  It means you are not using a single reasonableness standard of review.  You're arguing for a second standard of review that is so vague I don't know what it means.  Why not just say that the district court, when there is a conflict of this sort, has to spend two more hours considering the case?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There's a clear rule, you know.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, if you're going to do that, you have to tell me how much it weighs.  You see, if you use it in step two when things are in equipoise, it doesn't matter how much it weighs.  It's enough if it weighs a feather.  In the equipoise case you come out the other way.  But if you're going to use it in the first structural system to determine, you know, how much each side... I have to know its weight.  And there is no indication whatever as to what its weight is.  It's really up to the district judge, I guess, to decide how much weight he is going to give to the fact that there is this conflict.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not weighing reasonableness.  I'm weighing that factor of the conflict.  That's what you ask us to weigh.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not reasonableness.

Antonin Scalia  But it was a Federal policy that the Federal Government had every right to implement.  We do not want to support abortions.   Antonin Scalia  The issue here is whether the policy that California is trying to implement... namely, we do not want the employer to... in its view... disrupt the... the labor management relations by... by opposing union... unionization.   Antonin Scalia  That... that is the issue, whether that is a policy that California can... can implement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  Because it's wasting the money or because that is their--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --their labor policy?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just like... like Gould.  I mean, there is a case where a State used State money, no contracting with any... with any company that's been convicted of unfair labor practices three times.  Strictly State contracting policy, we just don't want to spend our money dealing with such a person.   Antonin Scalia  Why wouldn't that be the State's managing its own money?  It's our money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We just don't want to deal with people who oppose unions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think your reason for not paying for this activity is that you don't like this activity.   Antonin Scalia  I call that... I call that regulating the activity.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you allow the employer to engage in all other employee relations, and you're willing... that can be done without... the one thing the employer can't do is speak out against the union.  This isn't because you don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, the question of when the contract is done is different from the question of when the money is paid.   Antonin Scalia  He is asking with when the money is paid.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're not going to go through all of these one by one, are you?   Antonin Scalia  Let me ask you a basic question that doesn't require you to get into one by one.  Suppose you have a State that doesn't want to have its money used to assist unions.  This is an antiunion State and it adopts the same kind of law that you have.  And it simply says, none of... none of this State's... yes, you can recognize unions if you like, but none of the money that we give you--   Antonin Scalia  --shall be used... shall be used for collective bargaining or for any... any activities involving unions.   Antonin Scalia  Same.  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  To the employer.  No employer getting money from the State can expend any of our money... the same way yours is... in collective bargaining with unions or in anything else.  Now, we are not stopping employers from doing that.  We just don't like unions, and it's our money and we don't want this employer to use it for unions.  Would that be all right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why does that... why does that make a difference?  If it violates Federal policy, it violates Federal policy.  Livadas said you can't do it because it violates Federal policy, which is to favor unionization, and not to deter.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You could say the same about that other one.   Antonin Scalia  So does the statute I posit.  Just don't use State money.  You can use all of your own money to deal with unions; just we don't want our money used for it.   Antonin Scalia  That clearly would be banned and I don't see why yours is any different.   ",06-939X
0,"Antonin Scalia  That's not such an outrageous proposition.  You'd certainly acknowledge that the President and the Senate could not enter into a treaty that required the States to do something that was unconstitutional.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So there would be the situation that presents the shocking situation you've just described.  There is a treaty, but nonetheless it cannot be enforced domestically.   Antonin Scalia  It's self-enforcing.  I thought you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I thought you... you think this treaty is self-enforcing.  You don't really need the President's order here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is not of a nature to be enforced in a judicial proceeding in Texas.  Texas has procedural rules that disable the Texas court from complying with the ICJ judgment here.  Are you telling me that the ICJ judgment empowers either Federal or State courts to do things which... which their laws do not permit them to do?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And... and do you know of any other Federal law that... that interferes in the... in the procedures of State criminal courts, directs them as to what... what procedures they have to have?   Antonin Scalia  Really?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where?  I don't know what you're talking about unless you're talking about constitutional requirements.  Of course, those are binding on the States.  But you're saying that the Federal Government can prescribe State court procedures and authorize State courts to do things which... which the State government does not authorize them to do?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't agree with the last statement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We would have no... according to you, we would have no obligation to enforce this judgment but for the President's action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We could decide to go back, too.  But would we have any authority to do it?   Antonin Scalia  Wait a minute.  In order to get it to the Security Council, you have to take some affirmative action not to comply?  It's just not enough simply not to comply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought that was the point of Justice Ginsburg's comment, that there had been no decision not to comply.  Don't you need an affirmative decision to comply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I know you agree, but it depends on whether it's up to the President to make that call.  Usually when we have treaties that are not self... enforcing the judgment of whether that international law obligation shall be made domestic law is a judgment for the Congress.  Congress passes a law to enforce the treaty, and you're telling us that, well, we don't need the Congress; the President can make a domestic law by writing a memo to his attorney general.   Antonin Scalia  They were not parties to it.  What do you mean, ""covered by the judgment""?  Is this some... some new kind of new kind of jurisdiction?  If you're named in a suit by somebody else, you somehow acquire rights under that suit?  I don't know of any such principle.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  These people were not parties to the... the countries were parties to the judgment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The President espousing the judgment... Texas takes the position that this memorandum has... has no legal effect; it's a memorandum from the President to the... to his attorney general.  It's not a directive to the States.  In fact, it even refers to pursuant to the principles of comity, which suggests, you know, do it if you want to be cooperative, don't do it if you don't want to be cooperative.  What is your response to that?  And would it be enough if the President simply wrote a memorandum to himself saying that, I think this is the way that the... that the judgment of the ICJ should be enforced?  He doesn't have to tell Texas.  He can just tell his attorney general?   Antonin Scalia  Put precisely, it would be making it Federal law and then applying it.  If you assume it's not self-executing, somebody has to make it to domestic law.  Now, Congress can obviously do it by passing a law.  But you're saying the Court can do it, can make it domestic law and then enforce it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, yes, yes.   ",06-984X
1,"Antonin Scalia  It just means we agree that the case can go before the court.   Antonin Scalia  And we will be a party before the court.  Isn't there some doubt whether the... the Senate and the President, together, can... can take away from this Court the power and responsibility to decide what the treaty obligations of the United States are?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't there some problem there?   Antonin Scalia  Once again, there is a constitutional problem, is there not, if they are automatically enforceable?   Antonin Scalia  That is conferring upon the ICJ the responsibility to decide the meaning of a United States treaty which is United States law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm rather jealous of that power.  [Laughter]  I think it belongs in this Court.  And when you have a non-self-executing treaty, there is no problem.  It becomes U.S. law when the Senate and the House pass a law which the president... it doesn't become U.S. law because the President writes a memorandum to his Attorney General, but it does become U.S. law when a law is enacted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That solves the constitutional problem, but in the situation we're talking about here, I don't know on what basis we can allow some international court to decide what is the responsibility of this Court, which is the meaning of the United States law.   Antonin Scalia  A lot of people think that's exactly right, that really we expanded Federal habeas jurisdiction quite improperly.  But it happens every day, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  I think you misunderstood.  I thought he was asking whether if it is... assuming it is not self-executing, this Court can execute it.   Antonin Scalia  They mean it does not automatically become part of United States law.   Antonin Scalia  And it follows from that, that you have to change United States law?

Does it assume that you can bring an action on the contract and just bypass the provision of the contract which says there will be arbitration?  How can you do that?

That's... and that's, arguably, what the New York law and the Illinois... I... I don't know that any of those cases cited by the other side involved cases where the Illinois rule or the New York rule was applied in the teeth of an arbitration agreement that said something differently.

Antonin Scalia  Remind me why Section 9 doesn't get you there... because of the ""if"" clause.   Antonin Scalia  If the parties in their agreement have agreed that a judgment of a court shall be entered upon the award made pursuant to... but they have agreed to that, haven't they?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think... you think the State can enforce an arbitration award that would not be enforceable under the FAA?     Antonin Scalia  Assume we agree with you that this is a quick and dirty way to get arbitration agreements enforced if you want to bring it within 9 and 10, and if you don't, you're free not to; you can go to the State courts.  Why can't he still go to the State courts?  You say this is going to terminate the litigation.  Is this going to be res judicata on anything?  All it's going to say is the Federal courts have no jurisdiction over this.  It's not under 9 and 10.  You're going to run off to State court.  You're going to protract the litigation rather than bring it to a quick end.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.

How can we prove an agreement until we have discovery?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We say you need something more in order to go forward, something more than, you know, you prevented these people from talking to Johnny Cochran.  That's not going to do it.   Antonin Scalia  Well, there are two possibilities here.  Number one is the possibility that there was a general policy adopted by the high-level officials which was perfectly valid and that whatever distortions you are complaining about was in the implementation by lower level officials.  That's one possibility.  The other possibility, which seems to me much less plausible, is that the -- the high-level officials themselves directed these -- these unconstitutional and unlawful acts.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, that's lovely, that -- that the -- the ability of the Attorney General and Director of the FBI to -- to do their jobs without having to litigate personal liability is dependent upon the discretionary decision of a single district judge.  I mean, I thought that the protection of qualified immunity gave them -- gave them more than that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't give them much, if that's all it gives them.   Antonin Scalia  But they pleaded a conspiracy -- they pleaded a conspiracy in Bell Atlantic.

The farmer used to take his harvest to the mill, and it would be ground right there while he was waiting.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's absolutely true.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your brief constantly assumes that there has been no sale, that throughout the entire transaction, the utility owned what ultimately becomes the rods, as though it was indeed the same feedstock that produced the rod that was ultimately delivered.  And that is simply not true.  There is a change -- there is a change of ownership.  The feedstock that somebody else put into the mix is now transferred to the -- to the electric utility.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's exactly right.  You don't know.  So, you had cannot say that there has been no transfer of ownership.   Antonin Scalia  No, we've got the same molecules.  I mean, when you are talking about whether there has been a transfer of ownership or a transfer of title, you are talking about molecules; you are not talking about whether you ended up the same in, you know, in monetary terms.  You are talk about whether you have the same thing that you delivered to the person overseas.  And you don't, or at least you can't say that you do.   Antonin Scalia  That makes no sense, what you just said.  That contract makes no sense.  They hold title to it until they get the uranium rods, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Most of it is back overseas.  It's still mixed with the other fungible U 235.   Antonin Scalia  --Ms. Halligan, try this hypothetical, and it really gives you the benefit of the doubt.  Let's assume a department store buys raw wool from some sheep herder, sends it overseas.  And it's worth $1,000, this raw wool.  It is processed, spun and knitted into sweaters, and then shipped back to the department store.  The sweaters, all made from the same wool, not even fungible, so that's why this is even better than your example -- the sweaters when they come back, are worth not $1,000, but $20,000.  Do you think it would be unreasonable for the Commerce Department to treat that as a sale of sweaters by the European knitting wool or -- or home knitters who did the sweaters?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Say it again?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm talking about the -- I'm talking about the sale from the European mills to the American department store.   Antonin Scalia  A processing transaction.  It has changed a value of $1,000 into a value of -- what did I say -- $20,000?  And that's just processing?   Antonin Scalia  They said there was no sale.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When the pasta was imported, there was no sale into the United States.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's what we are talking about here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Get back to your pasta case.  Was the holding of that case that there was no sale into the United States?   Antonin Scalia  That's a different issue.  We are not talking here about which transaction establishes the price.  We are talking simply about whether there was a sale into the United States.   Antonin Scalia  Now, wait.  Suppose these knitting mills in my example, in fact, are selling their sweaters for a much higher price in Europe.  Instead of $20,000 for this batch of wool, in Europe they are selling it for $40,000.  And they nonetheless sell the wool back into the United States for only $20,000.  You are telling me that that transaction doesn't -- doesn't count for purposes of our antidumping law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That you have to look at the price at which the department store then sells to individuals?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the department store is not dumping.  It's -- it's the knitting mills that are dumping.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  And accepting that, you -- you have to begin the whole thing, however, with a sale, with a sale into the United States, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I thought this is -- this is what you say fails in this case.  That is the link of the chain that doesn't exist.  You say there is no sale in the United States.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What does -- what does the government do with respect to these other transactions where, indeed, the utility does not provide the feed uranium but just pays for, you know, getting -- getting the rods?

But the issue is not whether it's unreasonable or not.  The issue is whether it's an unreasonable application of -- of clearly established Supreme Court law.   Antonin Scalia  So the reasonableness or unreasonableness is out of the question.  You -- you first just have to look to Supreme Court law and say, is it conceivably an unreasonable application of that.  And -- and the answer to that is we -- we haven't decided the question of whether this is reasonable or unreasonable, and therefore, it cannot possibly be an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.   Antonin Scalia  That's right.  That seems to me not the--   ",07-1315
0,"Antonin Scalia  Is that precisely what we have to decide?  Or wouldn't it be whether it would be unreasonable for the State court not to come to that conclusion, which is one step removed?   Antonin Scalia  So -- so the usual test that the State court has to be affirmed, unless it's an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law, is altered when the State court has not had an evidentiary hearing that the Federal habeas court believes should have been held?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How do you get that out of the statute?  I don't understand it.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  What do you rely on for the proposition that if -- if you deny a hearing, all of the facts for which the hearing was demanded have to be assumed in favor of the party who asked for the hearing?   Antonin Scalia  No, but that can't be.  What -- what if I deny the hearing because there are ample facts that show what -- what the situation was, and a hearing would in my view be absolutely redundant?  And therefore, all of the facts that support the other side have to be washed out simply because I've denied a hearing?   Antonin Scalia  I wasn't addressing that.  I was addressing the proposition that when you deny a hearing, all of the facts for which you -- you demanded the hearing have to be assumed in your favor.  I -- it seems to me--   Antonin Scalia  --25 to life is 25, 26, 27, 28.  He has 25 years' worth of discretion, doesn't he?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but I didn't -- I didn't take that to mean under California law, since the jury found the one, it has to find the other.  He wasn't making that argument.  He was saying any jury that found that this was done intentionally, that's done, you know, with -- with planning, with -- with cover-up and what not, that jury is not going to find that he was crazy.  That's all he was saying, and -- and that seems to me entirely reasonable.   ",07-1315

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you -- do we have any other situation in which, for purposes of impeaching testimony, a constitutional violation is allowed?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's parallel to the Fifth.   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Saharsky, I'm -- I'm still a little hung up on -- on whether we would be allowing a constitutional violation.  General McAllister said that in the Fifth Amendment area, we -- we indeed allow -- allow it to be introduced in rebuttal even though that is the actual constitutional violation.  Is that the case other than in the Miranda situation?  I mean, suppose you have a generally coerced confession.  Would we -- would we permit that to go in?   Antonin Scalia  Exactly.  Well, why -- why is not that the case with the -- the right to counsel?   Antonin Scalia  But its real meaning is that counsel is guaranteed at trial.  Isn't that right?   Antonin Scalia  Its root purpose is that counsel is guaranteed at trial.  And here we're saying it's okay not to have counsel at trial so long as it's refuting a lie by the defendant.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would that violate the Admission Act?   Antonin Scalia  Did you answer my question just then?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Please, let me put my question again.  Let's assume that the legislature does not say, we want to give it to the Native Hawaiians because we like the Native Hawaiians or because we think they deserve it; but, rather, we think we have to give it to the Native Hawaiians because it's theirs.   Antonin Scalia  I think it would be.   Antonin Scalia  Is -- is it the function of the Hawaiian Supreme Court to declare moral obligations?   William M. Jay  Well, Justice--   Antonin Scalia  Would there be any problem -- certainly there is none if the legislature deems there to be a moral obligation and gives the land away on that basis.  But do you -- do you think there -- there might be some democracy problem if -- if the Supreme Court of Hawaii goes around pronouncing moral obligations and giving away land on that basis?   William M. Jay  --Well, Justice Scalia, that gets to the second half of my answer to Justice Alito as well, which is that the State supreme court is not free, as a matter of State trust law or otherwise, to formulate obligations that don't relate to the State's obligation as trustee of the Federal trust--   ",07-1372
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, why doesn't the Hawaii Supreme Court's reliance upon Hawaiian law to establish that there is some property right on the part of these Native Hawaiians -- why doesn't that conflict with Federal law?   Antonin Scalia  I don't care what you call it; it's a property interest.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  As I read the Federal law, it extinguished all property rights in these lands; the lands were transferred to the Federal Government; and the Federal Government transferred them in absolute fee without any encumbrances to the State of Hawaii.  Now, if you are telling me the Hawaii Supreme Court is now finding as a matter of State law that there is a property interest on the part of the Native Hawaiians -- I don't care what you call it, equitable or whatever -- it seems to me that is in flat contradiction of Federal law, and probably is an issue that we ought to address in this opinion.   Antonin Scalia  What if they do nothing at all?  Could I get back to Justice Breyer's three-sentence per curiam, where we just say to the extent that the Supreme Court of Hawaii relied upon the Apology Resolution as creating any -- any property entitlement in the Hawaiians, it was in error.  Okay, we send it back to the Hawaiian Supreme Court, and the Hawaii Supreme Court smiles and doesn't do a blessed thing, leaves -- leaves the injunction against any distribution of the land in effect.  What -- what happens then?   Antonin Scalia  You don't?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not if we said ""to the extent that"".  I mean, if we said it's -- it's grounded on the proposition that the Apology Resolution creates property rights and that's wrong, then they'd have to do something.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But if we just said, to the extent that it may be grounded on that, we take no position on whether it's grounded on that or not--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --why would that require any action on their part?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is the court the trustee?   Antonin Scalia  The State is the trustee.  So I assume it would be up to the State officers to decide to what extent the obligation to the Hawaiians, among the five obligations, should be given precedence.  Is the Supreme Court of Hawaii directing the State officers to give it precedence?   Antonin Scalia  And saying that the trustee must direct it primarily to -- to that among the five ends.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And all this comes from the fact that Congress made reference to and approved a so-called reconciliation process?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So in -- in perpetuam, this land can't be transferred because Congress approved the this reconciliation process?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I see.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or denying it to them?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't quite understand.  You mean -- you mean a Federal court can enjoin the sale of my house, and there's nothing I can do about it inasmuch as I do not have any present intention of selling my house--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --except to live under that injunction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no.  You -- you say there is no controversy, so I -- I cannot get its validity adjudicated, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think that -- I don't think that the State has to have an immediate intention to sell any particular piece of land in order to object to an injunction against any sale of land by the State in the future.  I -- I don't think it has to wait until it -- it wants to sell a particular plot.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, there is.  The State says, I am free to sell the land, and -- and the court says, no, you are not.  Isn't that a dispute?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you don't have to preserve it.  I mean, it's -- it's an issue of Article III jurisdiction, so we'd have to look into it on our -- on our own.

That's very strange to me.  I don't know what -- what motive Secretary Udall has today that might induce him to say that.

1,"Antonin Scalia  I thought that the rationale of Jackson was that the confession is simply deemed to be coerced if the defendant has expressed -- has expressed -- his desire to have counsel present or even to be represented by counsel.  It isn't clear that, which is already a stretch, to assume that simply because I said, you know, I would like to have counsel, if the police continue to say, well, come on, won't you talk to us -- it's already a stretch to say it's automatically coerced.  But now you're saying, even if the defendant has never expressed even a desire to be represented by counsel but has simply had counsel appointed, in fact even if he doesn't know about the appointment of counsel, the -- his confession is automatically deemed to be coerced.  That seems to me quite, even more extravagant than Jackson.   Antonin Scalia  Right.  What has he elected here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  Why would one do that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It is that, whether or not the defendant initiates the contact.  I mean, in civil matters, it's contrary to the ethics of the bar to interrogate the party on the other side when you know he has a lawyer, and that would be the case even if he initiated it.  You wouldn't think of negotiating with him without consulting the other lawyer, saying,  ""Can I talk to your client? ""  So that doesn't stretch over to this, to this situation.  We're not applying bar ethical rules.  We're applying, supposedly, a rule that determines when a confession is coerced.  All right?  That's what we're doing here.   Antonin Scalia  Why couldn't we solve your practical problem that we don't know in many States whether the defendant accepted appointment or not, by simply saying it is not enough to simply accept appointment of counsel; you must have requested counsel.  To merely say,  ""Oh, that's great, you appointed me counsel-- ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You must have requested it.  And that would be in accord with the holding of Michigan v. Jackson and would solve all of your -- all of your practical problems.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What happens under Michigan v. Jackson if I have never requested counsel?  I've never asked the court to appoint counsel, but I've gone out and hired counsel of my own, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it clear from Michigan v. Jackson itself, or--   Antonin Scalia  --We wouldn't be saying that.  We would just be saying that it is unrealistic to think that a confession is coerced simply because the police initiated the conversation so long as he said: Okay, I'll speak without my counsel present.  That's all we -- I don't see how it would infect any of these other areas.  It would just say that's -- that's one bridge too far.  This is prophylaxis on prophylaxis.   Antonin Scalia  That's true, but not much else.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a different question.   Antonin Scalia  You have to assume that his voluntary relinquishment of it is somehow coerced.  I mean there -- there is no way around that.  The man has said: I know I have counsel, but that's okay; I'll talk anyway.  And you say: So long as the police have initiated that conversation, we will deem it to be coerced.  You can't get around the coercion aspect of -- of this matter.  But that question is whether that is at all realistic.   INTERRUPTING ",07-1529
0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I think it's -- I think it's wrong.  I think it's common ground that so long as he says, even though I have a lawyer, I'll talk to you, that's okay.   Antonin Scalia  And that's not okay in civil cases, but it's perfectly okay here.   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Landry, I don't really understand what you're arguing here.  I thought you were saying there has to be a request in your response to Justice Souter, but then you accept as sufficient his merely saying thank you.  That's not a request.   Antonin Scalia  That's what I thought, too.  But you were saying there had to be a request.  You abandon that?  There doesn't have to be a request?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""Thank you"" is not a request.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't -- I don't -- I agree with Justice Souter.  I -- acceptance is something different from a request.  As I read the -- the State court's opinion, it was setting up a sort of offer and acceptance scenario.  The State was offering him counsel, said, ""I appoint counsel"", but it was ineffective until he says yes, ""I accept counsel"", whereupon, you know, he's lawyered up, but he isn't lawyered up until he says ""I accept"", and that's something quite different from -- from requesting counsel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, are you -- are you standing on the -- on the State court's analysis or not?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, the usual legal rule is that silence implies consent, right?  Read the prosecution of Thomas More.  That's the legal rule.  So why shouldn't we assume consent just from the fact that he stood silent?   ",07-1529

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think -- I think it's something of a misdescription to say that this spillage is occurring in the course of delivery.

Antonin Scalia  You mean it could have -- could have adopted some other means?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's all you mean by having control over it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.  So all you're requiring is knowledge that using this means will -- will result in a spill.  I don't think knowledge alone is enough for -- I think you need purpose.  If you arrange for disposal, I think you have to have a purpose.  It -- it has to be your object to have the oil leaking along the highway as you go.  Merely knowing that it's going to be leaking -- I mean, there may be some other way under the statute that you could find liability on the part of the shipper, but not, it seems to me, on the -- on the ground that the shipper arranged for this leak.  He didn't want the leak.  He knew it was happening, but that was not the object of the transport.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that a finding?  Do we have to take it as a given that this was an indivisible harm?   INTERRUPTING ",07-1601
0,"Antonin Scalia  But why is it necessary to have a special rule in order to prevent the trial from descending into a farce?  Why couldn't you simply apply the same rule of competency that you apply for whether the defendant can be tried, and then if in fact his self representation begins to turn the trial into a farce surely the court would have the power to prohibit his further self representation.  Certainly, turning a trial into a farce is a basis for the court's action; no?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The problem with taint would be his own fault.  I can't imagine that he would success on appeal claiming he tainted the jury.  And the advantage of waiting is that by waiting to see if in fact he will turn the trial into a farce you avoid the risk of depriving him of his right to represent himself, which is certainly a very important constitutional right.  Why didn't you wait to see whether he's going to be able to pull it off or not?   Antonin Scalia  Well, there must be precedents.  I'm sure under the old rule, if I can recall it the old rule, where you have a single standard for both the right to be tried... the... the ability to be tried and the right to represent yourself, there must have been instances in which the person who was representing himself was unable to cope and the trial was... was turning into a farce.  There must have been instances.  What did they do?   Antonin Scalia  Proceeds, that's what I thought.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is your test that you're going to apply ex ante?  Whether he's able to coherently--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, what's the test?   Antonin Scalia  Cannot communicate coherently?  I sometimes... I sometimes think that the lawyers cannot communicate coherently.  [Laughter]  It's really a vague test, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  But surely his total ignorance of all of the trial rules, the hearsay rule and the other details of conducting a trial, is a great disadvantage.  But we allow him to toss that away so long as he knows he's tossing it away.  That the judge instructs him: You're ill advised to proceed on your own; you're not a lawyer; this is, you know, a complicated process; are you sure you want to represent yourself?  And if he says yes, we say, well, you know, you've brought it on yourself.  Why can't we say the same thing about his supposed inability to communicate effectively, unless and until he turns the trial into a farce?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What would the standard of review be?  I'm a reviewing court.  The judge has not allowed this person to represent himself.  What's the standard of review?  Abuse of discretion or what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Abuse of discretion?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And what's your test, the same test: Inability to communicate no matter how idiotic?  I mean this man is living in a fantasy world.  He understands that he's on trial, but his whole world is just... he not only believes in Martians, he thinks we are all Martians, or something like that.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Why pick on just the ability to communicate?  It seems to me there are a lot of defects that can turn the trial into a farce.   Antonin Scalia  Do you worry at all that if we adopt a separate test for the ability to represent yourself, that the inevitable effect will be for the test for being able to be tried to become less and less rigorous?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  After all, there's no harm done so long as the person can't... is not allowed to represent himself.  I think there may be some value in linking the two, so that... so that the court knows that if he finds the individual capable of being tried, he may have to begin a trial with this individual representing himself.   Antonin Scalia  If it gets to be bad, the court can terminate it and say, you know, you can't represent yourself.  We're going to bring in counsel.   Antonin Scalia  Sure, it could be done if the trial is, indeed, turning into a farce.   Antonin Scalia  Well, why not just change the rule about what you can do, once the trial is under way?  You say sometimes it's not a farce.  It's just that this person is obviously incapable of making a coherent defense.  Why not wait to see?  What I object to in the proposal is making these judgments ex ante on the basis of... I don't know... psychological testing or past behavior or anything else.  Give it a try.  The person wants to represent himself.  It's his constitutional right.  If, indeed, it turns out that this is turning into a sham, fine, bring in a lawyer to represent him.  But doing it beforehand on the basis of your prediction as to what the trial is going to turn into seems to me not to give enough respect to an individual's desire to represent himself.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Fisher, what if the defendant here promised to sit silent during the trial as the defendant did in Godinez?  Would that be... would that render everything okay?     Antonin Scalia  But, he could certainly sit silent.  Having decided to represent himself, he could, if he wished, just sit silent.   Antonin Scalia  Maybe he writes badly.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How fair does a trial seem to the public where the defendant stands up and says, Your Honor, I want to represent myself?  I do not want this attorney.

Antonin Scalia  That's more than just the stuff that was on the record.  You've had the experience of a trial.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why do you concede that if the trial is not disruptive, the mere fact that this fellow is making an incompetent defense or, indeed, may be making no sense is justification for terminating the trial?  I mean, this person can plead guilty if he wishes and that's perfectly okay.  Can he not take the lesser step of putting forward an incompetent defense?  The State is still going to have to plead... to prove beyond a reasonable doubt before the case goes to the jury that he committed the crime that he's accused of, beyond a reasonable doubt.  And I don't know why the mere fact that his defense is incompetent or even is making no sense would justify... if that's what he wants to do instead of pleading guilty, that's, it seems to me, what the right of an individual consists of.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And all that (c) does is tell you what a claim is.  So that, even if it's not a claim against the government but just a claim against a subcontractor, that still can be the basis for liability so long as it's presented to the government.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does the other side concede that point, that you have to prove loss to the government?  I don't think they do, do they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think they do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You could say that the missed funds which are in the hands of subcontract... of contractors, harms the government, even though it doesn't come out of the government's pocket, because those funds were given for a particular purpose, and if that purpose is frustrated, the government is harmed.  That would work, without saying that the government has lost any money.   Antonin Scalia  Well, suppose the government gives money for building schools, okay, to a State and a fraudulent claim is submitted as... in connection with the construction of the school.  The government has been cheated in that the money it gave for a school is not going to the school; some of it is going into the hands of the fraudulent contractor.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I am talking now about the point of whether the government itself has to suffer any harm other than the fact that the money it gave was not used for the purpose for which it gave it.  That alone, it seems to me, could be harm.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Am I correct in this that without the claim definition, the statute would not cover a fraudulent submission by the subcontractor to the contractor which is known to be passed on to the government ultimately?

So the subcontractor submits and receives payment for $10,000 more than the subcontractor deserved.  All right?  But that all comes out of the hide of the contractor.  The contractor gets the same amount of money from the Federal Government and the fraud only harms the contractor.   Antonin Scalia  That would not be--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Why?   Antonin Scalia  A hundred dollars more a can.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He has to know that.  He has to know that his bill is going to be sent up the line to the government.  ""Knowingly makes, uses or causes to be made or used a false record to get a false or fraudulent-- ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --And if he knows it, serve him right.  But this other guy thinks he's just honestly cheating the guy who's buying the chemicals.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't shock me.  I don't know.  It doesn't shock me at all.  If indeed the object of this is to prevent fraud upon the government and if the government has not been deceived at all, get yourself a new statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This statute doesn't have to cover every ill in the world.   Antonin Scalia  But if injuring the Federal Government would... it would suffice to injure the Federal Government that the schools are shoddy and the roofs are leaking?  That would be enough?   Antonin Scalia  Even though the Federal Government is not out of pocket any more, but the program that it... that it was desirous of encouraging is simply not as good as it would have been otherwise.   Antonin Scalia  I thought--   Antonin Scalia  --I thought it was not established that anything from this defendant got to the Navy.   Antonin Scalia  Well, where in the record is there some indication that some... some paper from... with a fraudulent representation made it up to the Navy?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I know what certificates are, I mean, you know, their general content.  But was there anything in the record that a certificate from Allison went to the Navy with Allison's signature on it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then there's less to this case than we had thought.  My goodness, even under the Petitioner's theory, you win.  If indeed a fraudulent document was given to Bath and Bath passed that on, I think the Petitioners would have conceded--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that there's a cause of action.  What is all this fuss about, then?   Antonin Scalia  I wish you had said that in your brief because we could have saved ourselves a lot of reading.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And whose... whose contract required this?  It's a strange provision to be in the contract between Allison and Bath.   Antonin Scalia  And that contract between Allison and Bath said that this certificate from Allison had to be presented to the Navy?   Antonin Scalia  And Bath would have been in breach of its contract with Allison unless it passed these things on to the Navy?  That's why I say it's a strange provision to be in the contract between Bath and Allison.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Allison could sue Bath for not passing the certificate on to the Navy?   Antonin Scalia  Did you make this point in response to the petition for cert?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you know, usually we take a case to decide the question presented; and if this question is really not before us you should have told us that.   ",07-214X

Antonin Scalia  Well, they still have to identify individuals who are members.  Now, what does it take to be a member of the Democratic Party here?   Antonin Scalia  I thought... I thought they took the position that anybody who voted or intended to vote Democratic is a member of the Democratic Party.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any way in which you can say... and I thought this was the theory of associational standing... that this individual has voluntarily given this organization the right to represent that person for particular purposes?   Antonin Scalia  But that doesn't mean that I'm willing to have the Democratic Party represent me for all sorts of purposes.  And these people can bring their own individual challenges.  I mean, I'm not questioning their ability to do it.  But, but why is the Democratic Party their representative?   Antonin Scalia  That organization had members.  I mean, you did join that organization.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And they identified members who would be, who would be annoyed by the noise.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.

I was talking about whether there is a genuine threat of fraud which the State is moving to eliminate--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and your assertion that, you know, it's not much of a problem because the person whom you're impersonating would find out about it.  I mean... but that's certainly not the case for people who have moved away or people, you know, the people in the graveyards that are still on the rolls.   Antonin Scalia  I'd say likely.

1,"Antonin Scalia  And why, why can't the people injured by this law appear themselves and say the law can't be applied to us?  You seem to accept that a facial challenge is appropriate here.  Why is... some different kind of a facial challenge.  I thought in the usual facial challenge you have to show that there is no situation in which the law cannot be constitutionally applied.   Antonin Scalia  Then why are we arguing about whether there is one half of one percent of the electorate who may be adversely affected and as to whom it might be unconstitutional?  That one half of one percent, if and when it is sought to be applied to them, have a cause of action to say you can't apply it to me.  But why... what precedent is there for knocking down this entire law on a facial challenge when I think everybody agrees that in the vast majority of cases it doesn't impose a significant hardship?   Antonin Scalia  Does that scare you, Mr. Fisher, that there can't be a facial challenge?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, every facial challenge is an immense dictum on the part of this Court, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  This Court is sitting back and looking at the ceiling and saying, oh, we can envision not the case before us, but other cases.  Maybe it's one half of one percent or maybe it's 45 percent, who knows.  But we can imagine cases in which this law could be unconstitutional, and therefore, the whole law is unconstitutional.  That's not ordinarily the way courts behave, is it?   Antonin Scalia  Now, we've done that in the First Amendment area.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose you... you have your photograph taken when you register.  You're really an out of state person, you go in and register, you make up an address, you come in, you have your photograph taken; it proves that you were the person that registers.  It doesn't prove that you were the person that lives at that address, or that you are of such and such an age and whatnot, which the... the means of identification that you require would show, wouldn't it?

0,"Antonin Scalia  I don't see how there's any, any, any contradiction between reading the second clause as a... as a personal guarantee and reading the first one as assuring the existence of a militia, not necessarily a State-managed militia because the militia that resisted the British was not State-managed.  But why isn't it perfectly plausible, indeed reasonable, to assume that since the framers knew that the way militias were destroyed by tyrants in the past was not by passing a law against militias, but by taking away the people's weapons... that was the way militias were destroyed.  The two clauses go together beautifully: Since we need a militia, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Blackstone thought it was important.  He thought the right of self-defense was inherent, and the framers were devoted to Blackstone.  Joseph Story, the first commentator on the Constitution and a member of this Court, thought it was a personal guarantee.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They got nothing at all, not everything they wanted.  They got nothing at all.  So long as it was up to the Federal Government to regulate the militia and to assure that they were armed, the Federal Government could, could disband the State militias.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So what, what was the function served by the Second Amendment as far as the militia is concerned?   Antonin Scalia  And as I recall the legislation against Scottish highlanders and against... against Roman Catholics did use the term... forbade them to keep and bear arms, and they weren't just talking about their joining militias; they were talking about whether they could have arms.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dellinger, let's come back to your description of the opinion below as allowing armor-piercing bullets and machine guns.  I didn't read it that way.  I thought the opinion below said it had to be the kind of weapon that was common for the people--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that is common for the people to have.  And I don't know... I don't know that a lot of people have machine guns or armor-piercing bullets.  I think that's quite unusual.  But having a pistol is not unusual.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How many people in the country?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think it's common.   Antonin Scalia  Or a law on the carrying of concealed weapons, which would include pistols, of course.   Antonin Scalia  It means ""well trained"", doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't ""well regulated"" mean ""well trained""?  It doesn't mean... it doesn't mean ""massively regulated"".  It means ""well trained"".   Antonin Scalia  Wasn't... wasn't it the case that the banning of arms on the part of the Scottish highlanders and of Catholics in England used the term, forbade them to ""bear arms""?  It didn't mean that could just not join militias; it meant they couldn't carry arms.   Antonin Scalia  The freedom of speech that was referred to in the Constitution was also ""the"" freedom of speech, which referred to the pre-existing freedom of speech.  And there were indeed some restrictions on that such as libel that you were not allowed to do.  And yet we've never held that simply because it was pre-existing and that there were some regulations upon it, that we would not use strict scrutiny.  We certainly apply it to freedom of speech, don't we?   Antonin Scalia  Like libel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  What would that be... that you can, if you have time, when you hear somebody crawling in your... your bedroom window, you can run to your gun, unlock it, load it and then fire?  Is that going to be the exception?   Antonin Scalia  But that opinion also, it didn't use the militia prologue to say it's only the kind of weapons that would be useful in militia, and that are commonly... commonly held today.  Is there any Federal exclusion of weapons that applies to weapons that are commonly held today?  I don't know what you're worried about.  Machine guns, what else?  Armored bullets, what else?   Antonin Scalia  But that passage doesn't mean once it's an arm in the dictionary definition of arms.  Once it's an arm in the specialized sense that the opinion referred to it, which is... which is the type of a weapon that was used in militia, and it is... it is nowadays commonly held.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you read it that way, I don't see why you have a problem.   Antonin Scalia  You turn on, you turn on the lamp next to your bed so you can... you can turn the knob at 3-22-95, and so somebody--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You mean you can't have any more arms than you would need to take with you to the militia?  You can't have a... you can't have a... you know, a turkey gun and a duck gun and a 30.06 and a 270 and... you know, different... different hunting guns for different--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You can't do that?

Antonin Scalia  Which shows that maybe you're being unrealistic in thinking that the second clause is not broader than the first.  It's not at all uncommon for a legislative provision or a constitutional provision to go further than is necessary for the principal purpose involved.  The principal purpose here is the militia, but the... but the second clause goes beyond the militia and says the right of the people to keep and bear arms.  Now, you may say the kind of arms is colored by the militia.  But it speaks of the right of the people.  So why not acknowledge that it's... it's broader than the first clause?   Antonin Scalia  You don't even agree that Massachusetts was subject to the Second Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the time we're talking about, the firearms in the home ordinance, when was that?   Antonin Scalia  It's useful for such purposes as what ""keep and bear arms"" means and things of that sort.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They certainly didn't want to preserve the kind of militia that America had, which was a militia separate from the state, separate from the government, which enabled the revolt against the British.   Antonin Scalia  You wouldn't put it that way.  You would just say it is not being infringed if reasonable limitations are placed upon it.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Jay, is the government running with the fox and chasing with the hounds?  You want us to apply the provisions governing the Internal Revenue Code with regard to whether the statute has expired, but when it comes to interest you say oh, no, no, no, that doesn't apply.  Why?  Why shouldn't the two go pari passu, as we say?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, yes, they make the same mistake, but that doesn't justify your making the same, the same mistake.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's either, you know, they're both in one pot or they're both in the other pot.  And both sides want to... want to split them up, but why don't they go together?   Antonin Scalia  Right.  I thought you were making a second argument, that even if they were entitled to it despite the statute, they wouldn't be entitled to interest.  You don't make that claim?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I see.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Right.  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Plus interest.   Antonin Scalia  Wait what very narrow exception?  It didn't apply the exception.   Antonin Scalia  Don't the two go together?  If you could bring an injunction action, surely you don't have to pay the tax.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's what she is saying.  She is saying that those conditions exist here.  That this is not... not a plausible tax; and, therefore, she could have gotten an injunction; and, therefore, by a parity of reasoning, she doesn't have to go through the tax provisions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you could say the same about the tax on oleomargarine.  It is a perfectly valid tax but not when you impose it on nuts.  And here the tax on coal is a perfectly valid tax, but not when you impose it on coal that's in the stream of export.   ",07-308X
0,"Antonin Scalia  I'm not certain it was valid if this coal was not shipped overseas.  You're putting an awful burden on the government to know when the coal is severed and shipped.  You're saying if they mistake a shipment as being only for domestic use rather than for shipment abroad, they don't have any basis whatever for the tax claim.  I'm not sure I agree with.   Antonin Scalia  Why is the Export Clause so, so significant?  The only other self-executing constitutional clause that provides for damages automatically that comes to mind is the Takings Clause.  And we have allowed the states to require claimants to jump through innumerable hoops.  They have to exhaust all their administrative remedies before they can bring a suit here.  Why... why is the Export Clause any... any more sacrosanct?   Antonin Scalia  Volenti non fit injuria.  If indeed the taxpayer pays out the money for an unconstitutional export tax, it seems to me that person has no claim until he complies with the administrative procedures that render that tax unconstitutional.  But up until the point where he is paying it voluntarily, it seems to me there is no constitutional violation.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not saying it has to be made at the moment they pay their taxes.  I'm just saying until it's made there is no unconstitutional, unconstitutional export tax.   ",07-308X
1,"Antonin Scalia  I mean, you could say this was Congress, right?   Antonin Scalia  That's what the whole case is about.   Antonin Scalia  He wants a reason why that might be.  Do you know many instances in which Congress has set up a system in which you cannot determine whether a State tax is valid or invalid until some future event at an indeterminate time which may be three years later?  Is that customary--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --for someone not to know whether the tax is payable or not for sure until three years later?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that a good reason?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What harm is done?  Could you tell us in just a few words, what's the harm?  That's what Justice Breyer's concerned about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about the solvency of the person who has tentatively been declared exempt from your tax; so, therefore, you can't go get him right away?  This is not the ordinary citizen.  This is somebody who is on the edge of bankruptcy.  You would normally want to get your money out of him as soon as possible before he squanders what is left, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And would it... would it not happen with some frequency that, even though you could have collected the tax three years earlier, by the time it turns out for sure that there's never going to be a Chapter 11 confirmation--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Makar, you were going to address, I take it, the assumption that Justice Breyer has asked you to make, which is that the language here is ambiguous.  And your position is, I take it, that ""confirmed"" means ""confirmed""?   Antonin Scalia  Sometimes don't they want the transfer to be effective whether or not there is a later confirmation?  I thought that that was the assumption here: That some of these transfers they want to be effective whether or not a confirmation occurs later.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that spelled out somewhere in the... is its text somewhere in these materials?   Antonin Scalia  Not the full, not the full section, though.   Antonin Scalia  Just little snippets of it.   ",07-312X

There is no way at the time it occurs to say that this is a transfer under a plan.  There hasn't been a confirmed plan.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It requires under a plan confirmed.

Antonin Scalia  You would have no reason to know the answer to that question.  You are not the State.  The State has told us that millions of dollars have been lost in taxes not recovered.   Antonin Scalia  You missed the crucial... the crucial part.  The transfer has to be under a plan confirmed.  I mean, that's the troublesome language.   Antonin Scalia  What is the section you mentioned earlier that uses ""under"" in a sense that clearly applies to pre-confirmation?   Antonin Scalia  I'm looking for it, and I can't--   Antonin Scalia  --Did you make that argument there?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How does that provision read?  Do you have it quoted here?

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Herman, can the government respond to political speech?  The government can have a position on smoking cigarettes, it can have a position on a lot of things, but can it have a position on whether the Republican Party or the Democratic Party should win the next election?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that a distinction here?   Antonin Scalia  Do we usually evaluate restrictions on First Amendment rights on the basis of whether the chill that was imposed by the government was actually effective in stifling the right?   Antonin Scalia  If the person goes ahead and speaks anyway, is he estopped from saying that the government was chilling his speech nonetheless?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that's what's going on here?   Antonin Scalia  The government says that in fact more and quite a bit more incumbents went over the $350,000 personal funding limits than non-incumbents.  Something like... I don't know, 14-2 or something like that in the last election, is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, that could mean that the millionaires have already been elected and are now pulling up the ladder after them.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  But that wouldn't level the playing field.  I mean, the other side, the millionaire, won't take the public funding and he'll spend his millions and whoever gets the public funding... or are you saying the public funding should match whatever the other side pays?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well then--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Do you think that's a valid constitutional objective, to level the playing field?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think we should trust our incumbent senators and representatives to level the playing field for us?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What we're talking about in leveling the playing field, I guess, is leveling the amount of speech that each side has, to make sure that each side has the same amount of speech.  Is that... is that what's going on here?   Antonin Scalia  Are we... are we talking wealthy people here?  What's the average price of a home in the United States?  I think it's a good deal above $350,000, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't limit those restrictions on your candidate.   Antonin Scalia  It simply makes the imposition of the restrictions uneven.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't it prohibit...

Antonin Scalia  You think that's really a proper function of government, to look out over there and say, we're going to even the playing field in this election?  What if some... one candidate is more eloquent than the other one?  You make him talk with pebbles in his mouth or what?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the campaign finance regimes we've approved up to now, the significant limitations, have had an anti-corruption rationale.  There is no anti-corruption rationale here.  The only purpose of this is to level the playing field.  And I am deeply suspicious of allowing elections to be conducted under a regime whereby Congress levels the playing field.  That seems to be very dangerous.   Antonin Scalia  I thought that that's what a facial challenge essentially consists of.  You don't look to see whether in fact the harmful First Amendment effect has occurred; you look to whether it opens up the possibility for that to occur.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You can't go in before the election and say: Look, I'm about to be terribly disadvantaged; my opponent is about to have all of these coordinated expenses and I'm not able to.  And you're going to say: Oh, we have to wait until the election is over to see whether in fact that happens.  It seems to me this is precisely the kind of a situation a facial challenge is designed for.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What if one party has more time on his hands?  He's... he's unemployed, so he... you know, he can go around, whereas the other party has to... has to hire people to speak for him.  He has... he has a job most of the time.  Are you going to even that disparity, too?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can understand leveling, leveling contribution limits when you're worried about corruption, I can understand that.  But doing it just to... to make sure that there is an even playing field, I... there's just no end to that.  And it just isn't money that makes it an even playing feed.  A lot of other factors... incumbency, the war chest that incumbents have which... money from the last election, that isn't counted for... for the millionaires' provision.  There are so many factors that... that go to making the even playing field that I... I'm just very reluctant to acknowledge a congressional power to... to sit in judgment of our elections that way.

What would make it particularly heinous?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose... suppose the State says that all recidivist rapists of children under 12 will suffer the death penalty.  Does it have to narrow that class further?  I mean, the need for narrowing depends upon how narrow the class is described in the first place.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, if the law says you have to be a recidivist, you have to have all the other factors that you just mentioned, if the law said that, would you come in and say,  ""Oh, no, you can't just give everybody who commits that crime the death penalty? ""  You have to narrow the class.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a--   Antonin Scalia  --That's strange way of making a majority, isn't it?  [Laughter]  Two people who think even the death penalty for murder is no good, they're going to form the majority of people who consider whether a lawful death penalty can be imposed for rape.  I think at least in those circumstances, you have to discount the people who would not allow the death penalty under any circumstances for any crime.   Antonin Scalia  He--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --He... he is not considering the issue that is before the Court.  The issue before the Court is whether... whether a permissible death penalty can be imposed for this crime.  These parties say there's no such thing as a permissible death penalty.

Antonin Scalia  They don't even have to say  ""the extent allowed by the United States Supreme Court. ""  They can pass a law that seems to contradict a prior opinion of ours; can't they?   Antonin Scalia  Abraham Lincoln should they could, anyway.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you really think that if this Court held in the present case that the death penalty can be imposed for the rape of a child under 12, do you really think that the trend would not continue, that there would not be more States to enact such a penalty?   Antonin Scalia  That there would be more?   Antonin Scalia  That it would not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't there a Federal treason statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that doesn't require murder; does it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think that's unconstitutional?   Antonin Scalia  Do you think treason is worse than child rape?   Antonin Scalia  Well--   Antonin Scalia  --How do you do view recidivism?  I mean, I assume even if you don't oppose the death penalty, you're going to get a good number of years, right?  So you are going to be 40 years in prison, come out and do it again?  I don't think so.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, it is an unrealistic condition that you have raped a 12-year... a child twice.  The first time you do it and are convicted of it, you'll be sent up for long enough that you won't have the chance to do it a second time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand the difference.  If you have a general murder law with an aggravating factor of killing of a law officer, okay, the jury can decide from the whole category of killings of law officers who gets the death penalty and who doesn't.  Why is that any different from what happens when you have a statute that makes it a capital offense to kill a law officer, without any further qualification?  It's exactly the same result.  It goes to the jury.  This person killed a law officer.  It is up to you whether you give him the death penalty or not.   ",07-343X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Just the way they used to.   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Clark, what do you do with the requirement that our cases have imposed?  It is not a requirement I agree with, but it is certainly one our cases have imposed, that you cannot leave... leave it to the jury whether to impose the death penalty or not even for murder, but rather you have to narrow the class of people who have committed that particular crime so that... so that the imposition won't be random.  Although later, we say you have to let the jury consider any mitigating factory which makes it random; but nonetheless, our cases do say you have to narrow the class of murderers who can be given the death penalty.  Wouldn't the same apply to the class of child rapists?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why not.   Antonin Scalia  You think intentional murder of a... of a law officer would need no further narrowing?   Antonin Scalia  Do you?  Do you really?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Didn't the... didn't the Louisiana statute that... that was at issue in Lowenfield produce the result that if you committed intentional murder of a law enforcement officer, it was up to the jury whether to give you the death penalty or not?   Antonin Scalia  Would not the same result be... be achieved by a statute that said if you intentionally kill a law enforcement officer, you are subject to the death penalty?  Wouldn't it be precisely the same degree of narrowing?   Antonin Scalia  It was not all child rape.   Antonin Scalia  It was not all child rape.  It was only children up to the age of 11.

1,"Antonin Scalia  You don't need a reason to file a FOIA request anyway, right?  Just the naked curiosity justifies your obtaining the documents, right?  I mean this is a lawsuit that does not require a reason except I want the documents.  You've got them.  I'm entitled to them.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean somebody could have walked in off the street and filed this same lawsuit, right?   Antonin Scalia  Although it is not really just your argument; it is also FOIA; isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  What are your clear rules?  Give me... set it forth clearly, what you think it takes.  Number one, do... do you have to know you're going to be bound at the time the first suit is brought?  That isn't the requirement, is it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So what are your tests?  How many?  Five?  Four?  It is not a totality of the circumstances, test though, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have some criteria.  What are they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Agency?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  A representative that they agreed to?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  As in a class action, where they have the... the ability to bow out if they want, right?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I mean, and the individual's ability to withdraw from the class, if he doesn't want to be bound by this suit, right?   Antonin Scalia  That is crucial.   Antonin Scalia  We can use it accurately, bring it back to what it really means...--  [Laughter]  Can we?   Antonin Scalia  Even if company is represented by the same law firm?   Antonin Scalia  I think you'd also say that if the company paid for the suit.  The company just...  ""I don't want to be in control of it. ""  ""I don't want you to sue in my name, but I think this is a good thing for you to do, so I'll pay for it. ""   Antonin Scalia  No.  The company says,  ""absolutely I do not want you to represent me. ""  That is in... in a letter.  Okay?  So it's clear that the law firm is not representing the company, but the company thinks that it's a good idea to have this lawsuit and yeah, I'll bankroll it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think you've got to give that one away.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If he... if he was his agent... and this goes to Justice Ginsburg's line of inquiry... suppose in the second case Herrick tells him I want you to bring a suit on my behalf.  He says fine, I'll do that.  He brings that suit.  And then Taylor says, you know, I also want to bring a suit on my own.  And he brings another suit, not as agent for Herrick.  I suppose he could do that, couldn't he?  The first would be thrown out because it's Herrick's second suit.  But the... Taylor's own suit would remain Taylor's own suit, wouldn't it?     No.  No, Taylor--   Antonin Scalia  So long as there's no more collusion or anything else, he's--     --If Taylor brought the second suit in his own name and it was found to be barred by res judicata, a third suit in Taylor's own name would likewise be barred.  And there's a case that I think illustrates this point perhaps better than any of those we cited on our brief, unfortunately.  But I think it's helpful--   Antonin Scalia  --I hope so.     --because...--  [Laughter]  Well, Your Honor, I think that it proves the point that has been the sort of underlying concern of many of the questions: What happens when you're just shy of a true agency relationship?  And the case is United States versus Des Moines Valley Railroad.  It's an Eighth Circuit case, 84 F. 40 from 1897.  But importantly, this Court quoted it at length in the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad versus Schendel case--   Antonin Scalia  That's a... it's a standard privity case.  It is privity in reverse.  I suppose a subsequent owner of real estate is in privity with, and therefore, bound by a judgment concerning the real estate rendered against the prior owner.  But it's probably also true that when there's a suit by a later owner, the prior owner cannot then bring in court a claim based upon the same... the same matters that the subsequent owner relied on.     --Well--   Antonin Scalia  It's up privity instead of down privity.  Wouldn't that--     --I think what Your Honor is reacting to is the reality of the situation seems to be that there's a sufficient relationship between these two that they ought to be barred.  But there is no section of the Restatement (Second) that specifically governs this case.  And Petitioner's view, which is that somehow the Restatement (Second) has become codification of res judicata law would not permit it.   Antonin Scalia  --Counsel, you have described for us a thousand-headed monster of litigation, and your proposal for a solution is to cut off one eyebrow.  You're going to solve just the case of, you know, two people building an airplane.  You agree, anybody else in the association can file a lawsuit.  Anybody else in the United States can file a lawsuit, even if they're not in the association.  It seems to me that, you know, in order to cut off an eyebrow, I'm not willing to make a whole lot of incursion upon our traditional rules of who's bound by a lawsuit.     --Well, Your Honor--   Antonin Scalia  Why should we stretch for that?     --We are not advocating a broad rule.  We, in fact--   Antonin Scalia  No.     --think that's one of the virtues of our argument: That where there is a document that is of true public interest such that multiple individuals on entirely independent grounds might well seek it, they would not be barred.  But where a document has commercial value like this one does to Mr. Herrick, so that he can restore his plane without going to the incredible expense of developing another manner to prove to the FAA the airworthiness of that plane, there is that commercial value that gives him the incentive to try to relitigate over and over again.  And on Petitioner's view, as long as he stops just shy of an agency relationship, he can do that throughout the country.  And this is--   Antonin Scalia  It is sort of a totality-of-the-circumstances test in every case, right.     --Well--   Antonin Scalia  We look at the whole thing, and we say, you know, close enough relationship.  It is not close enough; close enough.  You need a better rule than that for something that, you know, is a threshold issue in a case.     --Well, Your Honor, it is interesting that the restatement with respect to the third category in the reply brief... they called it the third category of control perhaps.  It is described in the restatement in comment to section 62 as where the person falls short of becoming a party but which justly should result in his being denied an opportunity to relitigate.   Antonin Scalia  That's just as bad.  You're absolutely right.     That is the nature... that is the nature of res judicata principles.  That it is not: Can you avoid this by avoiding the legal technicalities?  It is the substance of the relationship that counts.  Thank you, Your Honor.   ",07-371X

There is record evidence that: One, Taylor and Herrick had identical interests; two, Taylor's interest was adequately represented in Herrick; three, Herrick and Taylor had a close working relationship relative to these successive cases.

1,"Antonin Scalia  We've said that regulation does include regulation by adjudication for purposes of... of Federal pre-emption laws.  Why would it... why would it be different for... for Indian law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, I understand, but I'm just talking about the first one now.  You say it is not... it is not regulation, right, under the first?  And that's... that's the only point I'm addressing.  Why should regulation through a process of adjudication not be considered regulation for purposes of our Indian law where... whereas, we have made clear in several cases that it does constitute regulation for purposes of Federal pre-emption under statutes that pre-empt state regulation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We could have said the same thing about the Congress.  Congress just said... just said ""regulation"", and we interpreted that term to include common-law adjudication.   Antonin Scalia  You don't really mean ""actual consent"" by ""actual consent"", right?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Maybe you should use a different term, like ""implicit consent"", maybe.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Oh, so one of your answers to an earlier question suggests the same point that you now seem to be making, although I don't... I don't recall it from your brief.  Apparently you think that it would be different if this antidiscrimination law of the tribe had been set forth in a tribal ordinance.  Is that right?  Would you say your client could have been held to it if it had been written, rather than simply a... a portion of tribal common law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not what I asked.  I asked whether you would acknowledge that your client could be bound if it had been written.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that doesn't make any difference.  We shouldn't place any weight on the fact that this was a common-law regulation, rather than regulation by a statute or ordinance.  You can't have it both ways.  It either makes a difference or it doesn't make a difference.   Antonin Scalia  But you just told me it didn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You just told me that even if it were written down, you would still need what you think is express consent.   Antonin Scalia  Wasn't part of the transaction the obtaining of back-up liability on the part of the individual Indians who, who owned the corporation?  Didn't they guarantee the loan?   Antonin Scalia  No, but it does give the whole thing a decided flavor of dealing with, with Indians on the reservation.  You're dealing with a corporation that, that's majority owned or entirely owned.  Is it majority or entirely?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  And then you get guarantees from, on reservation Indians.  It smells like dealing with Indians on the reservation to me.  Of course, this certainty that you're... that you're asking, your client could have obtained that certainly by inserting a choice of law provision providing that any disputes would be resolved somewhere else, couldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In the absence of that, why should we bend over backwards to give something that has the smell of dealing with the Indians any other name?  Your clients can fully protect themselves by a choice of forum provision.   Antonin Scalia  Is it a contract claim?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it a contract claim?  Was... was... was the claim a claim for discrimination in contracting so that it was part of the contract claim.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a freestanding tort action, is that what it was?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Wait.  They are, they are not objecting to a... to a general verdict.  They are objecting to the fact that in their view, one of the elements of that... of that general verdict is based upon what they assert is an invalid claim in the... in the Indian court.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know that they waive that when they when... when they allow a general verdict to go.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If evidence supports any one of the claims contained in the general rule.   Antonin Scalia  The tribal court of appeals would have to be finding Federal law.  It wouldn't be Indian law; it would be Federal law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You say they have adopted the Federal rules.  So whatever the Federal law... in other words, we would ask them to answer the question that you don't want us to answer.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Certainly, your reliance upon the Federal rules doesn't impress me as much as it did when you first told me about it, because apparently the Federal rules mean whatever the tribal courts say they mean; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And come to its own decision as to what they mean.   Antonin Scalia  And do we get special loan guarantees?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, it has to be a known... a known consensual relationship, for one thing.  Wouldn't you add that requirement.   Antonin Scalia  He backed off on that.  I pressed the point and...--  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, that may be; it depends on what you mean by ""tribal"".  I mean, it certainly would be rational to say that all disputes between members of the tribe can be resolved authoritatively by the tribal court, but it's quite a different thing to say that a dispute between a nonmember of the tribe and a member of the tribe can go to the tribal court.  It's sort of the analogue to being home fried in a foreign State.  It's... is pretty close.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Defendant, yes.   Antonin Scalia  You would add on the reservation?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --If he walks into some town in South Dakota, the mere fact that you know he's an Indian... it has to be on the reservation.   Antonin Scalia  Am I correct that the collateral here, the land, the land that was collateral was within the reservation but it was not Indian land.   Antonin Scalia  And you think that that's enough.  It doesn't have to... when you say ""on the reservation"", you include as on the reservation land that is no longer owned by Indians but... but is within the reservation boundaries.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no, wait.  You say that consensual relationship is not enough.  If you enter into relationship with Indian in South Dakota on, you know... in the State capital, that isn't enough.  It has to be on the reservation.  You acknowledge that.  And for purposes of on the reservation, it's enough that you're dealing with land that is within the reservation even... even if it is no longer Indian land?   INTERRUPTING ",07-411X
1,"Antonin Scalia  In a particular case, I suppose.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand -- I don't understand your response.  If -- if someone has an interest in -- in stopping a particular action that would be governed by -- by -- by this general regulation, surely that person could -- and is -- is -- is threatened proximately by that action, that person could certainly bring an action seeking to stop the action on the ground that this regulation is invalid.   Antonin Scalia  And that would govern that particular action, but it would also be -- be precedent for invalidating the regulation in other cases.  I -- presumably other courts would -- would similarly say that the regulation is invalid.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose the statute says anybody in the country can sue to stop a violation of the due -- due process clause.  Would that statute be valid?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Article III requirements cannot be eliminated by Congress?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kneedler, I don't even agree with you that a -- that a citizen-wide notice provision confers standing, because it's close to the APA.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Close -- close to the FOIA.  In FOIA, an individual citizen demands a certain document which the law entitles that person to.

0,"Antonin Scalia  What if there -- what if there was not a regulation on this subject, but the agency, by its constant practice, applies a certain procedure in all of these cases, would you have it -- the power in the abstract to challenge the agency's consistent application of a certain procedure?  You could certainly do it in a particular case, if the agency did something that was unlawful, you could certainly challenge it?  But let's assume you don't have a particular case, you just object to the fact that in all of its cases the agency is doing this thing that is wrong.  Will you have standing to challenge that?   Antonin Scalia  You would have standing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your complaint is I don't like the way the agency behaves?   Antonin Scalia  Why do you make a difference with respect to the regulation?  Why does the mere fact that this agency lawlessness happens to be reflected in a regulation, why does that suddenly alter the standing calculation?  You either have been harmed or you haven't been harmed.   Antonin Scalia  Is that all it says?  No, I think it speaks of categories across the board that affect -- that immediately, concretely affect the person complaining of the regulation, which is the case in these areas where you have a regulation requiring drug companies to have certain -- on pain of criminal penalty to print certain things on labels.  That immediately affects them.  I think that is what footnote 2 is about, not about -- not about any regulation that is across the board.  That wouldn't make any sense.  Where is footnote 2.  Let's read it.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  You need a permit to have a Christmas tree?  Where is this?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I know what you're talking about.   Antonin Scalia  That's not unusual.  I mean, standing looks not just to harm that has already been suffered but to harm that is imminent.  And if these people are regular bidders and they say, you know, I'm likely to bid on this next project, that's fine.  But these people are -- you don't know any specific project.  They are just people interested in forests throughout the United States.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's quite different from saying,  ""I am about to suffer harm, imminent harm, to me. ""  I don't see anything -- you know, anything except in the case that was settled that has that kind of a connection.   Antonin Scalia  Tell me the two cases again that you are relying on for this.   Antonin Scalia  And what's that?  What's the cite for it?   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask you about Northeastern Florida?  I have dug that out.  I don't think it -- it supports what you say.  In its complaint what was going on here is that there was a -- a minority business preference adopted by the City of Jacksonville, and some contractors who were not minorities sued saying that this was in -- in violation of the Constitution.  And what happened -- what the Court said about standing was in its complaint petitioner alleged that many of its members regularly bid on and perform construction works.  Now, if it had stopped there it might fit your case, but then it went on to say,  ""and that they would have bid on designated set-aside contracts but for the restrictions imposed. ""  As I read the case there were designated contracts, of which they said we would have bid on them but we didn't because of this -- what the case involved was the assertion by the city that you don't have standing unless you can show you would have been awarded the contract.  And we said, no, no, you don't have to be awarded it, but if indeed you were -- you would have been a bidder in that contract but for this law, that's enough for standing.  So that's not this case.

We simply ask: Could there have been a rational basis for this?  Now, are you willing to abide by that test?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Listen to what I'm saying.  Not whether you could decide that, given all of the facts of this case, the criticism of the co-workers and all of that, whether it is conceivable to say that this was done on a rational basis.  That isn't the rational-basis test.  It's just sitting back without these factual inquiries, just as we don't inquire factually into why the State legislature acted, just asking: Could there have been a rational basis for the dismissal of this employee?

Antonin Scalia  All those facts are true facts, but the government isn't claiming that any one of them was the reason.  It just says here are the conceivable reasons why... why she might have been fired.  We really don't know which one it was.

Lisa S. Blatt  Well, we are not relying on the text of the Equal Protection Clause.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, don't rely on the text, certainly.  [Laughter]   Lisa S.

I think if the police department was wrong, even if they had been very careful but for some reason or other they made a mistake -- so you're arguing for shear causality, not for negligence.  If negligence made the difference then we'd have to go into these factors that you say are very difficult to calculate.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I know you were answering his question, but you want to answer it in a way that's consistent with your argument here.   Antonin Scalia  You've injected the word ""negligence"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Alone, but--   Antonin Scalia  --there is dual causality.   Antonin Scalia  It isn't a matter of simple negligence.   Antonin Scalia  Just so I have your theory firmly in mind, you would say there is police error even if what happened was that there was an unpredictable and unavoidable computer glitch, no negligence on anybody's part?  The computer simply malfunctioned, got it wrong.  It wasn't negligence.  You would still say that that is police error, and you would say that that counts against the admission of--   Antonin Scalia  --Exactly.  You give something, you get something.  If you adopt a negligence theory, the--   Antonin Scalia  --the noose is not as wide, but on the other hand it's a lot harder to calculate whether you -- every case involves an inquiry into whether there's police negligence or not.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If the policeman is mistaken about whether he saw this guy picking somebody's pocket, he's mistaken about that, and in that case, the search is -- the product of the search is admitted.  In the other case he's mistaken about whether there was a warrant.  Why do you want to draw a line between those two?   Antonin Scalia  That's crucial to your case--   Antonin Scalia  --really, that you -- that the police will not keep good records unless -- unless we let the criminals go.   Antonin Scalia  And that's the theory of the exclusionary rule as--   Antonin Scalia  --as has been expressed in writings in some of our prior cases.  Things have changed a whole lot since we adopted the exclusionary rule, and I think it's quite -- policing has become much more professional, and I think it's quite unrealistic to think that if we don't adopt the rule that you -- that you propose, police -- police departments will just willy-nilly not keep track of warrants.  I -- I just don't think that's true.  That's not professional policing, and -- and I think to say -- to apply the -- the severe remedy that you propose in this -- in this area at this date seems to me excessive.   Antonin Scalia  You don't think that--   Antonin Scalia  I agree with that.  If -- to say with Mr. Dreeben that we don't have to decide that today is just unrealistic.  We have to decide today whether we are going to adopt a rule that down the road will turn every exclusionary request into a pretrial investigation of the procedures of the police.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And a major -- major trial.   Antonin Scalia  That's your bottom line position, it has to be a negligent error?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What is the position you're arguing for?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You want to adopt a rule that's only when it's a negligent error?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  May I ask one question, Chief.   ",07-513X
1,"Antonin Scalia  They -- they won't know that they are going to lose a case.  What they will know is that if they happen to arrest someone whom they should not have arrested anyway, they won't be able to prosecute him, right?   Antonin Scalia  So they are saving themselves nothing.  I mean, this person would not have been stopped.  I mean, if the difference was we -- we caught a criminal and we could have convicted him except because of the clerical error we can't, but that's not the situation.  They would never have found this fellow but for the clerical error.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You would allow all of that inquiry every time there's a motion to exclude.  That would not just be the basis for 1983.  You still want negligence inquiry.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Thank you.  That's a little different.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dreeben, if we adopt your formulation that isolated negligence doesn't count, is it clear that that's all there was in this case?   ",07-513X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Of course, I suppose if the phrase  ""now under the jurisdiction of the United States. ""  did not have any clear meaning when the statute was enacted, it -- it wouldn't have any clear meaning for the future, either.  So you don't -- you don't solve that problem by reading ""now"" to mean ""then"", right?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I'm saying it doesn't help if you do what the Government suggests.  That doesn't give any clearer content to the meaning of being under Federal jurisdiction.  It is still going to have to be worked out somehow.  The question is whether you work it out and apply it as of the time of the statute or work it out and apply it time by time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where -- where were you reading from?  I--   Antonin Scalia  --That's what's causing me confusion there.  You're talking about -- I wish we would just use the statutory numbers, but do what you like.   Antonin Scalia  Thank you.

Antonin Scalia  It was at a hearing, oh.   Antonin Scalia  He can include anybody else?  He can include, for example, people who are only one quarter-Indian blood, even though, you know, they went to the trouble of defining it as 50 percent Indian blood?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Very strange statute, just leaving it up to him to do whatever he wants.   Antonin Scalia  So -- so there is no limitations.  It includes this and it also includes whatever else he wants.  Is that it?   Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's a very strange reading of ""shall include"" when you're dealing with a word that does not itself have any solid content.  When you're dealing with a word that's pretty much self-defining, yes, you can say ""shall include this"", because what in addition is included is -- is pretty clear.  But these words have virtually no -- no content; and if you say ""shall include"" means, you know, it has this, I'm still left with well, what else does it have?  I can't believe that the statute was meant to be that expansive, to let the Secretary buy land for whomever he wanted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's pretty clear what the Court thought it meant, though, isn't it?  Whether it's dictum or not, it's pretty clear that the Court thought it clearly enough meant that, that they were willing to say bracket -- you know.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I agree.   Antonin Scalia  I agree.   Antonin Scalia  It suggests that it's not very ambiguous, I think.   Antonin Scalia  I'm interested -- I'm interested in the Secretary's conclusion that recognized ""tribe"" and ""tribe now under Federal jurisdiction"" are one and the same; that the words are used redundantly.  Does he know the rule that we usually don't -- I guess he doesn't because he interprets ""now"" to mean nothing.  Does he understand that we usually do not interpret words to have no meaning?  Why would they say both if they both mean the same thing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""Recognized tribe under Federal jurisdiction"", that, to me, means two different requirements.   Antonin Scalia  I don't -- I don't understand how you say that -- that the term ""tribe"" has no limitation to Indians.  ""The term ""tribe"", whenever used in this Act, shall be construed to refer to any Indian tribe, organized band or Pueblo, or the Indians residing on one reservation.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Yes, but I thought the question was whether it was unlawful at the time, before the later statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and you say that, even though discriminating against pregnancy leave was itself lawful, a retirement plan that did not give you credit for the time of that pregnancy leave was unlawful?   Antonin Scalia  And you say Gilbert had nothing to do with it?   Antonin Scalia  Go on, finish.  I--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand why you say that the retirement plan is facially discriminatory now.  You contend that right now it's facially discriminatory.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me what the retirement plan says is that there is deducted from your seniority, for purposes of calculating what you get under the plan, all periods in which you -- you were lawfully not deemed to be -- to be working for the company.  Now, that doesn't seem to be facially discriminatory at all.   Antonin Scalia  No, but it didn't.  Not -- not during the period for which it is used in -- in the retirement system.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  After the new legislation was passed, yes, pregnancy leave counts for seniority.  But -- but during the period before that occurred, it was not counted towards seniority, and it -- and it was lawfully not counted towards seniority.  So what you have is a retirement plan that says all lawful periods of work -- all periods of work are -- that lawfully must be credited will be credited to the -- to the employees.  I don't see how that is facially discriminatory.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is -- is there a difference between ""facially discriminatory"" and ""discriminatory impact""?  I mean I can see how you could say it has a discriminatory impact, but to say that on its face, when all it says is that you are credited with all of the periods in which you were lawfully working for the company and you are not credited for periods in which the company lawfully deemed you not to be working for the company, I don't see how that is facially discriminatory in -- in any sense.   Antonin Scalia  Did it say it was facially discriminatory?  I'm -- I'm just talking about your -- your assertion that it's facially discriminatory.  Did Bazemore more say it was facially discriminatory?   Antonin Scalia  What -- what do you do about section 703(h) of Title VII, which -- which we have held says that -- that makes it lawful for a bona fide seniority system to perpetuate the effects of pre-Act discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That hinges -- that hinges on your ""facially discriminatory"".   Antonin Scalia  Well, yes, that's -- that's rather implausible, but 70(h) covers sex discrimination and even race discrimination, but it doesn't cover pregnancy discrimination.  I mean, I--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You need pretty clear language to persuade me of that.   Antonin Scalia  You mean there are a lot more suits coming behind this one--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --for any kind of discrimination that preceded Title VII?  When was Title VII enacted?

1,"Antonin Scalia  Do that again, will you?   Antonin Scalia  Why do you say in light of the jury finding when you have disavowed any necessity that the jury had found this?     Well, Your Honor, we do--   Antonin Scalia  I mean  ""in light of the jury finding. ""  why don't you just drop that.     --Well, Your Honor, we think it's important because there are certain jury findings that we know the jury made in this case.  The jury returned a special circumstance verdict.  And we know based upon that verdict that at a minimum, the jury found that Respondent was a major participant in the crime -- just taking the facts of this case, the Respondent was a major participant in the robbery, that he exhibited a reckless disregard for human life.  And we also know that the jury rejected a duress defense.  The jury was instructed on that defense, and yet the jury came back guilty.  So I don't think that the -- that the inquiry should take place in a vacuum, but, of course, the reviewing court should have the benefit of the limited jury findings that we do know were made, and then apply the sufficiency inquiry in light of those jury findings.  There is no reason to disregard the jury findings that were made.   ",07-544X

1,"Antonin Scalia  Say it again?  What is the common ground?   Antonin Scalia  Well then, this is not really a very significant case, is it?  Because I presume that these enterprises that agglomerate claims and bring suit as a collection agency, they could simply get their compensation, instead of by way of, of a flat fee, by, you know, claiming entitlement to 2 percent of the rewards.  So it's no big deal, I mean, really.   Antonin Scalia  Go ahead, I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  What if all of the claimants assign their claims to something called an agglomeration trust and the... the person who's bringing suit here brings it as a trustee?  He has no interest in it personally and he is compensated the same way, the same way this agglomerator is compensated.  He has no personal interest.  He could sue, couldn't he?   Antonin Scalia  So once again, it's no big deal.  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --What do you do about... about aggregated plaintiffs who are not in the field of Federal regulation?  They're just sort of out of luck?  Can they petition for the creation of an FCC that they can take their claims to?  I mean, this is a fluke that there happens to be this Federal agency they could have gone to.  Certainly our principles of standing should not depend upon that fluke, should it?   ",07-552X
0,"Antonin Scalia  But also not one in which the issue of standing was raised and decided.  And our jurisprudence says that where we do not address the issue of standing the case has no precedential value on the subject.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't consider two decisions an enormous body.   Antonin Scalia  Well, we don't count the lower courts.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What's the earliest of those cases in our Court?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The earliest case in our Court that upholds this that, without specifically addressing the standing issue, gives judgment?   Antonin Scalia  1920?   Antonin Scalia  In Vermont Agency, in the Vermont Agency case, which dealt with qui tam, that many people, including the Justice Department, thought did not confer Article III standing, we held to the contrary that it did confer Article III standing, mainly because it had been around forever.  It was... it was the understood part of the judicial power when the Constitution was adopted.  Do you have any case prior to 1920 in which English courts or even early American courts thought that this, that this would be sufficient to bring a lawsuit?   Antonin Scalia  Sure, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It's more than a wrinkle.  The assignee keeps the money.   Antonin Scalia  What's the earliest Federal court case you have?   Antonin Scalia  Late 19th century?   Antonin Scalia  I was under the same misimpression, I have to say, and I wrote it.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I must say we seem to have come full circle from Flash v. Cohen, which said that the doctrine of standing had nothing whatever to do with Article III.  That it all... the only thing it's there for is to assure that concrete adverseness on which our adversary system depends.  You've come full circle from that to now your argument that concrete adverseness doesn't matter at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there a combination of the two that's possible, that maybe one of the elements of Article III standing is that both parties have a stake in winning and losing?   Antonin Scalia  Except for counterclaims.  He says I have some counterclaims.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Englert, is this one lawsuit or 1,400 lawsuits, or however many clients you have?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They opposed it on what seems to be a reasonable ground, that each of these claims is quite different.  There are different calls, different... different amounts owing.  Each case is not going to be judged on the same... on the same facts.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Englert, could you--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Englert, can you explain to me again how it is that when you acquire 14 separate choses in action, 14 separate claims, against the same defendant, just by your acquiring them they sort of melt into one cause of action.  How does that... how does that happen?   ",07-552X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Your implied -- your implied preemption argument would certainly fall prey to that -- to that point.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Good idea.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Petitioner says you have in an earlier case.     I don't believe that the position that the United States stated in Reilly is dispositive of the first question presented in this case.  But, again, that doesn't mean that the brief that the United States has filed with respect to implied pre-emption is not relevant.   Antonin Scalia  The Commission -- when did the Commission know of this stuff?  I had a case when I was on the Court of Appeals, so it had to be before 1984 involving so-called lip drape--     --You're right.   Antonin Scalia  --by which the smoker covers up the little holes that bring in some fresh air.     In 1978--   Antonin Scalia  It's been general knowledge for a long time, and the FTC has done nothing about it.     --There has been a question.  In 1978, the Commission issued a notice requesting comment about whether lip drape in fact occluded the holes that dilute the concentration of the air, and the tobacco companies did not respond to that, even though they had their own studies showing that it was a problem.  So it is -- it is true that the Commission has only now issued the notice proposing to withdraw its earlier guidance; but the Petitioners themselves should not be able to benefit from their own misleading of the Commission.  But again, I think it's more fundamental than that, is that their arguments rely upon a misconception of what the Commission does.  As Justice Souter noted, it is hornbook law the Commission does not supplant State law; it acts cooperatively with State law.  The Commission does not act as a gatekeeper like FDA in approving things.  It acts as a law enforcement agency.  It goes after fraud when it is aware of it.  But that is not to the exclusion of State law enforcement agencies or other Federal law enforcement agencies.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask a question?  I plan to go back and see what the Government said in the -- in the case that Petitioner asserts you have effectively supported his position on -- on express pre-emption.  I plan to go back and read it.  Assuming I agree with him rather than you, has the government's position changed from what it was then?  As far as you know, is the government's position still the same, the position that you delicately did not bring to our attention?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  In Reilly.  I haven't read the brief there, I must say.  But suppose I agree with Petitioner.  Can I assume--     Of course--   Antonin Scalia  --And do you assume that it's--     --The position of the United States as stated in the Reilly case was that the express guarantee provision did not pre-empt a regulation of the nature in that case.  It was our position that that, because it was--   Antonin Scalia  --No, I'm not asking about -- I'll figure that out on my own.  Trust me.  I can probably figure that out.  But once I have figured it out, can I assume that that is still the government's position--     --Well, I--   Antonin Scalia  --whatever it is?     --Well, I would think that we would need to revisit the question in light of this Court's holding in Reilly, in light of the additional precedents that there have been over the last decade or whatever it's been since that decision was issued.  So--   Antonin Scalia  You have no idea which direction that would lead?     --We have not taken a position on the first -- on the bottom line of the first question presented.

It is not specially targeted at cigarettes and at the harmful health effects of cigarettes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a general statute but in Riegel we -- we took a general statute and looked at what its specific application in the case was.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Is this included in the question presented anyway?   Antonin Scalia  Does it have anything to do with the way the Second Circuit resolved this case?   Antonin Scalia  The Second Circuit simply said you could not deprive an individual of the right to a court trial.   Antonin Scalia  And the issue is whether--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Now, if -- if we held that you can require the individual to go to arbitration, in some later case we could confront the question of whether, if the union is in exclusive control of the arbitration and the -- the individual will not get a fair arbitrated deal, that would invalidate it.  But it has nothing to do with the question presented: Is an arbitration clause which clearly and unmistakably waives the union member's right to a judicial forum enforceable?   Antonin Scalia  So I -- I hate to get into this, you know, nine years' history of dealings between the union and -- and the employees.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What does that mean?  Does that mean that they must go to arbitration even if the union decides that, you know, this claim is -- is so insignificant we don't want to take it to arbitration?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Salvatore, I -- I didn't think we took this case to -- to determine the specific meaning as to this issue of this -- of this particular contract, which is not an issue of national importance.  Why -- why must we decide the case here?  Could we not simply decide that the Second Circuit was either correct, in which case the case would be over, or incorrect to say that you -- that you -- you cannot -- you cannot in a collective bargaining agreement have the union responsible for arbitration of title VII claims?  Why couldn't we just decide that?  And then if there is any issue of whether such concession to the union deprives an individual of even the right to arbitration, that can -- that can be decided on remand by the Second Circuit, couldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  And the Second Circuit could look into all of these details.   Antonin Scalia  And inquire into the New York law that you're talking about now and that I don't recall being in any of the briefing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Salvatore, would you -- would you object to or oppose a ruling that said -- that says yes, the -- the right can be subjected to union arbitration, but if the union chooses not to arbitrate it, the individual must have the right to arbitrate it on his own?   Antonin Scalia  He has got an arbitration instead of a lawsuit.   Antonin Scalia  Article VII, no?  Article VII?   Antonin Scalia  You said Article VI.  Isn't it Article VII, if it's on 47a?

Now, you can't take away my right to that unless I voluntarily waived it.  What is sacrosanct about the fact that my grievance here has some discrimination attached to it?  Your briefing talks as though it is something totally apart from a mere economic right.  Ninety-nine percent of the time, you're talking about economics.  ""I was fired because of discrimination. ""  ""I wasn't promoted because of discrimination, and therefore I lost this -- this amount of money or that amount of money. ""  Why is it unthinkable that the -- that the employee would have to go through the union-prescribed arbitration for the fact that he wasn't paid for the last three months but does not have to do it for an economic injury that occurs because of discrimination?   Antonin Scalia  You did raise that issue, but you didn't say that the consequence of that issue was that you win.  You said the consequence of the fact that that issue was involved in this case was a good reason not to -- for us to accept cert. And we didn't take your advice on that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's a totally different issue whether because of that question you -- you should -- you should win the case.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't have to be within the question presented.  You -- you can sustain the judgment below on any ground.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why -- why doesn't this come within that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why don't many of these cases, if not most of them, come within that?  The union negotiates the salaries for various levels, and then the person says: I should be at this level.  The only reason I didn't get it was that I was discriminated against.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You -- you call it a non-economic -- phooey, it's an economic case.   Antonin Scalia  It is not taking away the right.  The -- the union is not taking away the right.

Are they changing their policy or not?   Antonin Scalia  The latest order, the one that's up here, says that all of the statements to that effect in the past were simply staff statements and that the Commission had never held to that effect before.   Antonin Scalia  But I think it rewrote that in its last order, and I think it even explained away the Golden Globe statement by saying it was not as categorical as it might appear.

They acknowledge at the end, and that's why they didn't impose a fine, that although this, you know, nothing that they had done up till now -- although their staff had -- would have misled anybody; still and all, it wasn't all that clear, and therefore we won't impose a fine.

They said even when it is used just as a swear word or as an expletive, the reason it has its impact is precisely because it refers to these excretory or sexual activities; that's what -- that's what gives -- gives it its zing.   Antonin Scalia  Of course there is.   Antonin Scalia  Don't use golly waddles in -- instead of the F-Word.

The word ""reduce"" alone doesn't convey that.  The word ""reduce"" would just mean, you know, if you -- if you knock it down any amount, you have reduced it.  But you are saying ""minimize"" requires more than that.  It means reducing it to the maximum extent reasonably possible.  Isn't that what you are saying?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just to reduce.   Antonin Scalia  You -- I didn't understand that to be your position.  You -- you don't think that ""minimize"" even means that you reduce it to the maximum extent reasonably possible?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think any reduction constitutes minimizing?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Let me say it again, and you tell me whether you agree.  I had thought that what you meant the meaning of ""minimize"" was is that you reduce the -- the harm to the maximum extent reasonably possible, not merely that you reduce it to some extent.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, ""reasonable"" includes everything.   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Mahoney, I -- before you go any further.  I am not clear.

You wouldn't say, I can't buy the house because for me it's not economically available.  I might say it's not economically feasible, it's not economically possible, but it's not economically available?  That's weird.   Antonin Scalia  I disagree with that.   Antonin Scalia  But that -- but that -- that doesn't answer, it seems to me, the question.  Yes, the best available for that purpose, but what is best for that purpose could include other factors such as how expensive is it and -- and how much it harms the industry and all sorts of other things.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  Why -- why does it?  I don't know how you draw the lines you are drawing.  You say yes, ""best"" includes whether it would bankrupt the industry.  Well, if it includes whether it would bankrupt the industry, why shouldn't it include whether it would bankrupt the individual power company?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- I agree with you on that, whether it's borne by the industry.  But you draw the line there.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't where that line is drawn up to the agency?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.

Can you testify to your own knowledge that this is what the analysis showed?  And he would have to say, no, it was one of my subordinates who did it, but I can tell you he was a very reliable person.  How would that -- I don't understand how that would work.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Fisher, how many States do things the way -- the way you would have them done?  I mean, how many States don't have these -- these notice laws, but in fact bring in the analyst to -- to give the information?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, they bring in witnesses if -- if defendants demand, but--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Fisher, I am interested in the history since that's what the Court held in Crawford, that the content of the Confrontation Clause is not what we would like it to be, but what it historically was when it was enshrined in the Constitution.  As a matter of history, was there a business records exception, not from the hearsay rule but from the Confrontation Clause?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that a business records exception?  I don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Oh, wait.  You say it's -- that business records would often or usually not be testimonial?   Antonin Scalia  Would have been nontestimonial.  So they'd come in on that basis, not because they were business records?   Antonin Scalia  Well--   Antonin Scalia  So you say they could introduce the squiggly line and put on the stand an analyst who says what that squiggly line shows is that this was cocaine?   ",07-591X
0,"Antonin Scalia  I don't see the difference between the two.  I mean, the one, he saw the blue car going down the street, which through other evidence can be connected to the defendant; and here the witness says this is cocaine, which through other evidence is going to be connected to the defendant.  And in both cases that -- that connected fact is deemed essential by the prosecution for the conviction.   Antonin Scalia  For the indictment, not -- not as -- not as independent evidence in the prosecution.  It would form the basis for the indictment, as I understand what the history is.  It would not be introduced and -- and -- and shown to the jury as evidence that -- that indeed the cause of death was thus and so.   Antonin Scalia  Ballistics as well?  You would extend this to ballistic tests?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You -- you don't have to bring in the ballistic expert?  You can just--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand that difference.   Antonin Scalia  Why not?  I know I prefer one thing, the custody.  It's very important to know whether indeed this was the particular substance that was taken from the defendant.  And to establish that, you have to establish a line of custody.  And you can't do that without getting in the person who did the test.   Antonin Scalia  He says -- the policeman says,  ""And I gave it to the University of Massachusetts lab. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""And I watched when they marked it in a particular way. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How do I know that that thing is the one that got to the desk of the analyst who wrote this report?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you say you can require witnesses to show that, right up to the analyst who did the testing, you can require witnesses to testify?  All the way up to there but not the analyst himself?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  They are admissible in criminal cases as far as the Confrontation Clause is concerned because they are not testimonial.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We are back to Roberts then.   Antonin Scalia  Don't these people have to appear before the same judge again and again?  The point made these are repeat attorneys, and I don't think you make friends and influence people among judges by insisting upon testimony in criminal cases where it is obviously not needed.   Antonin Scalia  But--   Antonin Scalia  --It's not material prepared for trial.  It's not material that was generated precisely in order to prosecute an individual.   Antonin Scalia  Exactly.   Antonin Scalia  Let's, let's assume that it's critical to a particular murder prosecution what time the shot was fired, okay?  And you mean to tell me if -- if somebody says I heard the clock strike 12 at the time the shot was fired, that would not be testimony?  Yes, the clock is a machine, right?   Antonin Scalia  He is just reciting what the clock said.   Antonin Scalia  And there was not a broad exception at common law for public records created in anticipation of criminal litigation.   Antonin Scalia  Have you found cases where the material was admitted as a public record despite the fact that it was a public record created for prosecution?     INTERRUPTING ",07-591X
0,"Antonin Scalia  We know what's going to happen on remand, though, don't we?  Doesn't the Fifth Circuit already have case law on -- on that question?   Antonin Scalia  Sorry.  Does this appear somewhere in the materials?  It's always helpful.   Antonin Scalia  That's not your point.  It would seem to me your point is that the QDRO is an exception to the assignment or alienation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And your point is this has been no assignment or agency, so we don't need the QDRO exception.  There is nothing in here that violates anything in the statute.   Antonin Scalia  So whether he could have done a QDRO or not is in your view irrelevant.  You don't have to come forward with excuses of why he didn't and so forth, your basic case is the QDRO is an exception from the prohibition on assignment or alienation, that provision has no application here, there has been no assignment or alienation, and therefore the waiver is effective.   Antonin Scalia  Well, we -- I mean, we could have -- you know, we should have thought of that when we limited our -- our grant of certiorari to the -- to the one question on which you agree with the Petitioner.  But we did do that, didn't we, even though the other one was -- was explicitly put under our nose, and we said we -- we are not going to get into that?  We just want to decide this question, which is an important question all by itself.   Leondra R. Kruger  Well, for several reasons, Your Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to answer both the plan documents question as well as the anti-alienation question.  One is that it is an alternative ground for affirmance.  The other is that it was properly raised in the Court of Appeals.  It was raised in the cert petition as well as in the brief in opposition.   Antonin Scalia  Do you know any other case in which we have explicitly declined to accept a question and then have used one of these other back doorways of -- of answering it anyway?   Leondra R. Kruger  I--   Antonin Scalia  I don't know of any.  I mean maybe -- maybe we have but--   Leondra R. Kruger  --I'm -- I'm not sure that I know of any either, Your Honor.   Antonin Scalia  --Did -- did we recognize in earlier cases that beneficiary designations are plan documents?   Leondra R. Kruger  Well, Your Honor, I think the question of whether beneficiary designation forms count as plan documents, is a little bit beside the point.  The -- the plan documents in this case do specify a procedure for determining who is to receive benefits.  It says that benefits will be paid to the designated beneficiary, the person who is designated by the participant.  And it says that changes to those beneficiary designations shall be made in the manner that's prescribed by the plan.  And so, because the plan sets out a procedure for changing beneficiary designations, we think that it would be inappropriate to look beyond that to require plan administrators to look to extrinsic documents in order to determine whether one of them overrides that designation.   Antonin Scalia  Again, assuming there has been a change of beneficiary designation, and, of course, the argument you're confronted with is: I haven't changed anything.  The prior beneficiary simply -- simply refused to accept it, waived it.  I haven't changed the designation at all.   Leondra R. Kruger  Well, in this case there is a conflict then between the wishes of the participant, who by all accounts would have chosen not to change the beneficiary designation, and that of the beneficiary.  And in that case in order to effectuate the -- the interests of all parties involved in order to provide certainty to all parties in ascertaining what their rights are with respect to the plan, then it is incumbent on the plan administrator to abide by the designated beneficiary.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think it's a harder question than you make it; and I, for one, have not gone into it as deeply as I would like to, principally because we rejected that -- that question.   Leondra R. Kruger  Well, again, Your Honor, we think it would be appropriate for the Court to go on to address that question because the issues have been fully aired both in the Fifth Circuit and in the briefing in this Court.  But if the Court were inclined to -- to reserve that question for a later time, I think that would be fine as well.  And--   Antonin Scalia  Was this waiver only part of the divorce decree?  Do you agree with your friend on that point?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not separate and apart from the divorce decree.   ",07-636X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Do you know of any case in which we've done this--   Antonin Scalia  --rejected the question and then decided it?   Antonin Scalia  That's what I'm asking.  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  You are sure of the answer.  You don't know of any case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It would be the classic case but for the fact that we had rejected that question.  Had we not been asked to decide it and said no, it would be the classic case, I agree.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can we expect that to happen in future cases when we turn down a question and amici and people come in and brief the question anyway and then ask us to decide it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Undoubtedly we should have granted it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where would I find the latter?  If I wanted to read it?  Which I do.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  21A?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, it also goes to the question of who is the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If there was a waiver and there had been no order, your friend's contention is by traditional common law, the person who would have been entitled to it would have been his client.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, I don't see how this language helps you.  It sort of restates the question, but--   Antonin Scalia  --Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If there had been no order--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Oh, I see.  I see.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I see your point.  Does he agree with that, that apart from the divorce decree, there is no waiver?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I got you.   Antonin Scalia  I see.   Antonin Scalia  You say the waiver is in the order?   Antonin Scalia  And without the order, there has been no waiver.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We'll have to see whether your friend agrees with that.  I'll bet he doesn't.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What if they had agreed to the waiver apart from -- apart from the -- from the domestic relations order?  Just apart from that, they have a separate signed waiver.  We'd be in the same suit that you're -- that you say we have to avoid, wouldn't we?   Antonin Scalia  Well, if it's an alienation, but his point is that a waiver is not an alienation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about some other waiver that's -- that's not in connection with a -- with a domestic relations thing?  You know --  ""I've made my -- my eldest son a beneficiary. ""  It turns out, you know, he is fat and happy; he doesn't need the money and he agrees to waive it, so -- so I can give it to an impecunious daughter.  Okay?  What -- what happens with that?   Antonin Scalia  Ah.  Oh, oh, oh.  You're jumping over to the other argument.  Let's leave that argument out.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but you would still -- the plan would still have to make some inquires, wouldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  Not getting in the plan documents.   Antonin Scalia  Sure.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's -- that's the point that troubles me.  It's -- it's the ""acquirer's"" language.  Does -- does the person who -- who receives the -- the refused benefit acquire it from the other person?  He certainly doesn't do so for Federal tax purposes.   Antonin Scalia  Does he acquire it from a participant or beneficiary?   Antonin Scalia  I thought the -- the notion is it's as though the -- it's as though the devise to the person refusing it had never occurred.  I mean, there is -- there is no gift tax payable or anything else.   INTERRUPTING ",07-636X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Why just a homicide?  What was -- what was the indictment here?  What was he tried for?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why wouldn't assault with a deadly weapon suffice or, alternatively, why would you have to know that it was first degree murder or second degree murder?  I don't know how you get from the text of the Washington statute that all you have to know is that it was a homicide?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But -- but he wasn't prosecuted for homicide.  I mean, the crimes are much more specific--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --first degree murder, second degree murder.   Antonin Scalia  How does that appear from the statute?  If I read the statute, I would have thought that you have to have knowledge that he was -- would negligent homicide suffice?   Antonin Scalia  Where is that?  Is that in the charge to the jury?   Antonin Scalia  It's not in the court's charges.   Antonin Scalia  Did -- hadn't other Washington State courts made a similar error in their interpretation of the Washington statutes?   Antonin Scalia  And the same -- and hadn't the prosecutors in Washington in misstating the standard the same way and using  ""In for a dime, in for a dollar. ""  to mean precisely the wrong thing, namely that even if you were in for beating him up that's enough for holding you liable for homicide?   Antonin Scalia  Including this one in an earlier case.   Antonin Scalia  The only reason I raise it is, is to show that this jury was obviously perplexed on the point.  It asked for further instructions three times on this precise point, what did -- did he have to know.  And all the trial judge did was say read, you know, read my instructions, which essentially recited the statute.  And what all of what you've just acknowledged shows is that reading the statute doesn't help a whole lot.  It doesn't clarify.  It doesn't, it doesn't correct any misimpression that the prosecutor could have created.   Antonin Scalia  Let's look at -- where is that?   Antonin Scalia  In the white?

Antonin Scalia  But you -- from your argument, I would gather that a court would be able to imagine a counterclaim.  Once it finds out, you know, what -- what -- what the principal complaint is about, the court could imagine that there would be a counterclaim for interest or for something else.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's very strange to decide Federal jurisdiction on the basis of -- of imagined -- imagined complaints.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the problem with his -- I mean with his interpretation, you don't have to imagine anything.   Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You don't have to imagine complaints.  You -- you don't have to invent litigation.   Antonin Scalia  It's close to inconceivable to me that Congress wanted us to -- to construct litigation that is not yet in existence.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but your position is it doesn't have to exist.  Had that litigation not been brought, had the motion to arbitrate been brought before a lawsuit was filed, that the court would still have to consider what is the dispute between the parties and what kind of complaints could that dispute have generated.   Antonin Scalia  That's what worries me.  [Laughter]  If we accept your theory, this is the easiest case, what about the hard cases that are further down the line?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it makes a nullity of it, except that it gets into the Federal court the decision on the arbitration agreement, which was the object of this stuff, whatever -- whatever the underlying claim is, whether it's a Federal claim or not.  As I understood the purpose of the Arbitration Act, it was to make sure that arbitration was -- was honored not just in Federal cases but in State cases as well.  And it's entirely compatible with that, that sometimes a Federal court will -- will direct arbitration in a case this involves an underlying controversy that's purely non-Federal.   Antonin Scalia  Why -- why can't you have sort of modified look, through like a modified limited hangout or whatever it was?  That is to say, you can look through for the purpose of determining whether the arbitration agreement raises a Federal question.

In the hypothetical we've been discussing, just as in this case, there was a State law and if you assume the State law is valid before it's gone through the judicial clearance process, there is a State law change when the clearance process results in striking down the law.  I don't... it seems to me that the two situations are pretty parallel.   Antonin Scalia  On the other hand, I can also see the attorney general saying: Why should I preclear it?

Now, I assume that such a law would violate the First Amendment if it were extended to all employers.  Saying no -- no company employee, no private employee can engage in political activity would surely violate the First Amendment.  Would it violate the First Amendment if it was extended?

You're saying what the First Amendment -- as the First Amendment applies to private individuals, so it applies here.  This is regulation by the State, rather than the State's control of State government.   INTERRUPTING ",07-869X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, but it, it, by reason of the unusual law at issue here I think it's unusual, I don't I'm unaware of any other State that has one the sentences the defendant has an entitlement to have the sentences run concurrently unless a certain additional fact exists and that additional fact is to be found by the judge rather than by the jury.  So that if you take seriously what what we have said in prior cases, namely that any fact which has the effect of lengthening the sentence to which the defendant is entitled must be found by the jury if you take that seriously, I don't see why it doesn't apply here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How many others?  Do you know?   Antonin Scalia  You know, this fact can can turn out to be the most significant fact for the defendant.  I mean, it could lengthen his sentence enormously.  It's more important than many of the other facts that we leave to the jury.   Antonin Scalia  But you could say the same about sentencing in general, and we held that the Sixth Amendment does impose a limitation upon judicial power where at least there is an entitlement by law to a certain lower sentence.  And there we said you can't leave it to the judge to decide whether the facts that trigger that law exist or not.   Antonin Scalia  So I gather from your argument that you would -- you would be taking the other side and you would be saying that it has to go to the jury if, instead of being a statute that applies to concurrent sentences from various crimes, there was added to a particular crime, if this crime was committed with the use of a gun, any sentence imposed shall not run concurrently but shall run consecutively with any other sentence arising out of this same occurrence?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There it's attached to a particular crime.  Do you really think that we should have a different result in that case from this one?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You could say the same thing about the length of the sentence, that it was up to them and they considered a wide array of facts.  So what?  We said in Apprendi, once you try to narrow it by law and say they can't do more than this, once you do that, that fact has to be found by the jury.  And that's what's going on here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you could say the same in Apprendi.  It was a judicial determination how much of a sentence you were going to get from ten years to life.  It wasn't up to the jury.  It was up to the judge.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And yet when you constrain the judge and you say, judge, you cannot give more than 20 years unless the crime was committed with a -- with a gun, we said suddenly that that matter can no longer be left to the judge.  It's a matter of law, and the facts must be found by the jury.  And I don't see any difference here.  I mean in both cases it was traditionally done by judges.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a lot easier to limit it to sentence than it is to limit it to sentence for a particular conviction as opposed to sentence for the whole ball of wax, all of the -- all of the horribles that Justice Breyer proposes would -- would be overcome if -- if you just adopted a rule that only applies to sentences.   ",07-901X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Lannet, in -- in connection with Justice Ginsburg's question, do you think that Apprendi would apply differently to a statute which, instead of imposing a higher penalty for a crime committed with a firearm, said that the penalty will be 30 years for burglary unless the defendant did not commit the crime with a firearm, in which case it will be 15 years?  Do you think if the -- if the statute were framed in that way, that Apprendi would not apply and we would leave it to the judge whether a firearm had been used or not?   Antonin Scalia  Well, regardless of who proved it, I mean, the issue is can it be left to the judge to decide whether the -- the -- the beneficent determination that he did not use a firearm could be left to the judge instead of sending it to the jury?   Antonin Scalia  I don't see a dime's worth of difference between that and Apprendi.   Antonin Scalia  Booker/Fanfan as well, as adopted, right?  I mean that was what the dissenters in Booker/Fanfan would have--   Antonin Scalia  --The core question is is the defendant entitled, entitled, to get no more than a certain penalty if a particular fact is found.   Antonin Scalia  And the answer would be, yes, he is entitled if the fact is found that he didn't use a gun to get a lesser penalty.  And once you bring in the legal entitlement, as I understand Apprendi, it means that it has to be found by the jury.   Antonin Scalia  No entitlement to a lesser sentence?   ",07-901X
0,"Antonin Scalia  You're not answering the question clearly.  Are both the prosecutor, in Justice Ginsburg's hypothetical, and the policeman liable?  Can't you answer that?  Yes or no.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Good.  That's what I thought your answer was.   Antonin Scalia  Well, she's more concerned about the prosecutor, and the prosecutor, also, would be treated just like a police officer?   Antonin Scalia  In the case?   Antonin Scalia  And how do you get the policeman who has fabricated the evidence?   Antonin Scalia  What -- what does that prove?  What does that prove?  I don't understand why you bring that up because it shows that the fact that there aren't many cases, only 17 in the -- in the Second Circuit, it doesn't mean anything because the Second Circuit is not applying as liberal a rule as your opponent suggests.  Is that--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.  That's -- that's just what I said, and, therefore -- and had it been applied that way, there would have been more than 17 cases in the Second Circuit.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING ",08-1065
1,"Antonin Scalia  I don't know what you mean by that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The difference here is that the -- the absolutely immune act which follows the -- the unlawful act is -- is an absolutely immune act by the very actor who performed the earlier act that -- that you say induces liability.  And so the argument is, what's the use of giving him liability later on if -- if you can simply drag him into litigation by -- by alleging that he at an earlier stage committed a violation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's the difference.  I mean, to me that's the -- the crux of this, that it is the same actor who has absolute liability whom you're trying to get on the basis of -- of earlier action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it won't be protected.  They won't have that assurance, because when they -- when they produce evidence at trial, oh, yeah, I guess the production at trial will be protected, but you're -- you're telling us that they can go back and say, ah, but you got that evidence in a bad manner, and therefore we can sue you, not for introducing it at trial, but for fabricating it before trial.  I -- I don't see that there is much of a difference as far as the deterrent effect upon the prosecutor is concerned.   ",08-1065
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, why would we say that?  Just because it wins your case and it solves your problem?  I mean, it seems to me, to do that, you abandon your principal argument, which that -- which is that ""place"" doesn't mean ""State"".   Antonin Scalia  And to talk about the whole State of California as the principal place of doing business -- I mean, if Congress meant that, it would have said, the principal State in which business is done.   Antonin Scalia  You don't want to throw away that good argument, do you?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",08-1107
0,"Antonin Scalia  More than -- more than what, more than any other single State?   Antonin Scalia  But it doesn't say the -- the ""principal State of business"".  It's the ""principal place of business"".  Is there a difference between the two?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand why, somehow, a Californian is more likely to identify with Hertz, simply because there are more Californians and, hence, more Hertz outlets, than a New Jerseyite is likely to identify with Hertz.  Per capita, there are probably as many Hertz outlets in New Jersey as there are in California.  The only reason that you come up with California is it's an enormous State.  It has 10 percent of the population.  But as far as the citizens of the State identifying with that -- with that company and, therefore, the unfairness of -- of letting that company -- you know, remove to Federal court, New Jersey and California are absolutely the same.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it is one of the factors in other -- in other states as well.  It's part of the totality of the circumstances.  You certainly increase your odds to move your headquarters.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't worry about private individuals gaming the system, do we, by -- you know, in -- in order to get into or out of Federal court, establishing residence in a different State?  We don't worry about them gaming the system, do we?   Antonin Scalia  Sure.  But -- but you can have a genuine intent to go somewhere else, and I don't know that people do it for foreign reasons because they want to get in or out of Federal court.  You really don't worry about that, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  I know some rich individuals that might have the incentive.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a surprise.

The three -- the three remain three.  The bankruptcy court should not do this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There are a lot of commas.  What comma are you referring to?   Antonin Scalia  Where is (c)?  You have been talking about 523(c).  I can't find it in any of the materials.

And it should not have done it, and future bankruptcy courts shouldn't do it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It makes a big difference to how I'm going to look on this case.  I mean, if you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Is it -- is it easy for a bankruptcy judge to identify a particular debt as a student loan debt?  I mean, would the bankruptcy filing -- filing show it -- you know, student loan debt?   Antonin Scalia  It would?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That -- that's not enough for me, that it's not improper for him to do it.  I want you to say that that is what he ought to do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you're not willing to say that.  You're willing to say that bankruptcy courts can do that if they like, but, you know, if they have a kid that has a lot of bankruptcy debts, he has a soft heart for student loan debts, he sees this as a student loan debt, all right, let's give this kid a break.  And he enters -- that's okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you would say it's wrong for the bankruptcy court to do it without a waiver, and -- but you're leaving open if there is a clear waiver, despite the fact of no adversary proceeding -- you're not -- you're not necessarily willing to say that the bankruptcy court can't do that?   Antonin Scalia  If that's the price of your winning this case, it's clearly worth it now -- agreeing with Justice Breyer on that point.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I mean, if indeed the Court would not be willing to go along with -- with your assertion that you can't undo it later, once it's been done, unless it is clear that it should not be done and that the bankruptcy judge shouldn't do it, and that a lawyer shouldn't propose it -- if that's the condition, then you should accept it, right?  Because you want to win this case--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I guess I don't understand your position, because I thought you had said that this should not have been discharged and now -- now you've answered to Justice Ginsburg that so long as the -- as the creditor appears they can all be discharged.  Now, which is it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even if the creditor appears, it shouldn't be discharged.  I thought that that's what you had said before.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, they're -- they're eliminated -- at least the right of contact with the water can be eliminated by an avulsion, right?  When there's -- when there's avulsion, even at common law and under Florida law, it -- it can happen that some land between the property owner and -- and the water will be owned by the State.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, why wasn't this an avulsion?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, well, well, well.  There were -- there were two avulsions.  One was the avulsion of its being washed away and the other was the -- the rapid replacement of sand.  That -- that is not a natural, gradual phenomenon.   Antonin Scalia  If there's no case law, it seems to me you've lost your case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you can have quiet hot dog stands during the daytime.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, such -- such boats floating in -- in the water below the mean highwater mark are available with respect to all littoral properties.  Isn't that right?   Antonin Scalia  But what can't happen with other littoral property is that folks can't come in and lay down beach blankets and occupy that sand, right, so that you have open sand in front of -- in front of your house?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And people pay a lot more money for beach -- beachfront homes, for that reason, don't they?   Antonin Scalia  And that's quite different from having a house behind the beach at Coney Island, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The State gave you some quid pro quo for this, which is to say this new sand is projected to last 6 years, has to be replaced regularly, because your -- your property is being eroded, which is the reason the State went into this.  And what the State has given you in exchange is that if and when there is further erosion, you will continue to own up to whatever this new line is called.   Antonin Scalia  The ECL.  You will continue to -- to own up to there, despite the fact that under common law when there's more erosion, your -- your line would recede to the new mean high-water mark.  So, you know, who -- who knows?  Maybe that's sufficient compensation.  You know, if you go in and ask for compensation, the State might say, you know, we've given them -- given them this property right in exchange, and the difference between that and what they have now is two dollars.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did any of these beachfront owners think this was a good deal, that the State has prevented further erosion of their land and, you know, the price they pay for that is that they have this 60-foot stretch that -- that the public can use, and that may wash away in 6 years anyway, and if they're lucky the State won't have enough money to put it back?  Or ----  [Laughter]  Did anybody -- I'm not sure it's a bad deal.  And they're guaranteed against -- against further loss of property because they will continue to own up to that -- to that new line, even if it's all covered by water.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Nobody -- nobody thought it was a good deal?  Everybody thought that they had been done out of something?   Antonin Scalia  Petitioner's members, but other people along -- along the same coast?  I mean, if I had a place and it's being -- it's being eroded by hurricanes constantly, you know, I -- I'm not sure whether I wouldn't -- wouldn't want to have the sand replaced, even at the -- at the cost of having a 60-foot stretch that the State owns.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It may not change the property line, but all of your property might be under water--  [Laughter]  --right?  That wouldn't be very good.   Antonin Scalia  Well, your members were, but I was asking whether some other people might not have thought it was a pretty good deal.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought Martin was -- the Martin case was -- was pretty close, the lake that -- that the State lowered.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Did the -- did the Florida Supreme Court cite it?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that weird?  Why didn't they cite it?   Antonin Scalia  Do you think that's true?   Antonin Scalia  I know they said that.  Do you think that's true?  When I read it, it seemed to me to deal with reliction precisely.   Antonin Scalia  A good lawyerly response.   Antonin Scalia  They wouldn't own to the mean high-water mark if there were an avulsion, if -- right?  If--   Antonin Scalia  --If by nature, this 60-foot beach had been put in, then their deed would be changed, wouldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  You shovel away the sand.   Antonin Scalia  What if it's going the opposite way?  What if it's -- if they built up sand?  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.

It was an avulsion in that case, wasn't it, because it was sudden?   Antonin Scalia  Is -- is--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You have a case for the proposition that an -- what would otherwise be an avulsion is an accretion if it's done by the State?   Antonin Scalia  Or vice versa.  What would otherwise be an accretion is an avulsion if done by the State?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What if it is?   Antonin Scalia  Sand Key's statement strikes one as -- as correct simply because I think that's -- that's the view of the common law.  I -- I don't think that's unique or distinctive to Florida.  I think it would be very strange to have a principle that all the -- all the littoral owner gets is a right to access the water and not the right to be on the water, to have his property on the water.  I think -- I think in every State, beachfront owners would be astounded to learn that that's the case.  So, I -- you know, I thought that Sand Key was just expressing what -- what was the common law.  And the notion that -- that the only purpose of the contact with the water is so that you can have access, that is -- is that not silly?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would that person still be considered a littoral owner?   Antonin Scalia  After there has been the avulsive event that separates him from the ocean by 60 feet of State-owned land, would he still be a -- a riparian owner?  I thought--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --He's not talking about the Act.  He's just talking about your theory of the case.  Your theory of what the rights of beachfront owners consist of would permit this to happen, if not under this Act, under some other act, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  Well, it's the Spring Break Act of 2010, okay?  [Laughter]  They could do that, couldn't they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Under your theory of the case?

[Laughter]  I mean, I think it's -- if -- if -- if you have a -- a principle that the citizen is supposed to know when he's violating a criminal statute, this is -- I mean, it is just too much.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Number one, I am -- I am not going to draw any generalities from the civil rights statutes.  I mean, this is an area unto itself, and, number two, the Sherman Act explicitly -- ""explicitly"" -- clearly confers upon courts a common law, a common law ability to define the crime.  And that doesn't appear from this statute.   Antonin Scalia  There's no such thing as a vague law, so long as this Court says, oh, what the law -- the law -- it's absolutely unclear what the law means, so long as this Court says, oh, we think the law means -- what do you want to pick -- bribery, then -- then it's okay.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that the system we have, that Congress can say, nobody shall do any bad things?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it comes to this Court, and this Court says, bad things means bribery.  And that law is a valid law, right?   Antonin Scalia  The principle that you're arguing for, that -- that a law that is, on its face, inherently vague can somehow be rendered valid to the citizens by a decision of this Court?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you say it was a body of law.  It wasn't about a body of law.  We said it was wrong.  So Congress is not here referring to some established common law crimes at all.  It's referring to a mistaken series of decisions by the courts of appeals.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's quite different from -- from harking back to a common law term, such as fraud.   Antonin Scalia  But it's -- it's not -- it's not just one.  One of the briefs in one or the other of these cases describes the great variety of ""pushing the envelope"" prosecutions that the Justice Department has, indeed, pursued, and they are all over the place.  And if the Justice Department can't figure out what -- what is embraced by this statute, I don't know how you can expect the average citizen to figure it out.   Antonin Scalia  I have one--   Antonin Scalia  --You -- you say he violated State law?  I -- I thought that the -- that the court found that he didn't.  You say he violated State law when he voted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought they -- I thought it was accepted in this case that -- that there was no violation of Alaska law.   Antonin Scalia  I -- I see.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Well, even--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Even after he discloses he still couldn't vote that way, so he's supposed to vote against it even though he thinks it's a good thing for the State to do?   INTERRUPTING ",08-1196
1,"Antonin Scalia  But that's the same before courts.  That's no different.  I mean, yes, a court has to come to a decision, but so does an arbitrator.  And I really -- I really don't understand what it means to say that the contract does not cover it.  I mean, the -- the contract either requires it or does not require it.  And if the contract is silent, either the court or the arbitrator has to decide what is the consequence of that silence, in light of the background, in light of -- of implied understandings.  Is the consequence of the -- of the silence that a class arbitration is permitted, or is the consequence of the silence that it is not?  But those are the only answers.  The contract requires it or the contract doesn't require it.  I don't know anything in between -- the contract is silent.  If the contract is silent, it's up to the court or the arbitrator to decide what that silence means.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do I have to agree with Judge Posner on that?

It isn't whether, on the one hand, they agreed to permit it or, on the other hand, they agreed to prohibit it.  Just forget about the latter.  They must have agreed to permit it.  Where did the arbitrators say they agreed -- they agreed to permit it?  Not simply, they did not agree to prohibit it.  You don't have to agree to prohibit everything in a contract.  You have to agree to permit it.  That's what contracting is about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, no, I mean, they -- they put it just -- just the way that -- that is not good for you.  ""The panel is struck by the fact that Respondents have been unable to cite any post-Bazzle panels or arbitrators that construed their clauses as prohibiting a class action. ""  That's not what -- what they have to find.  They must find positively that it permits a class action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just give me some language that says that.  I -- there is nothing in that paragraph that says it.   Antonin Scalia  So the only language you can point to is that -- is that 50a?   Antonin Scalia  You are hanging your whole -- your whole assertion that -- that these arbitrators not only found that the contract did not prohibit it, but found that the contract positively authorized class action, upon that language on 50a?

0,"Antonin Scalia  What -- what -- what power conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution permits the Federal Government to assure that sexual predators are not at large?   Antonin Scalia  But you said no.  I mean, there is no constitutional power on the part of the Federal Government to protect society from sexual predators.  And, you know, once the Federal custody is at an end, it seems to me that's the only power you could be relying upon.   Antonin Scalia  But it's fully reestablished once he walks out of Federal prison, at least if he walks out of Federal prison into a State.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but they don't fall through the cracks if the Federal Government notifies the State into which this prisoner is to be released: We are going to release a prisoner; we think he's sexually dangerous; you should take some action to be sure that he doesn't harm society.  Because that's a State police function, it's none of our business.   Antonin Scalia  General Kagan, you are relying on the Necessary and Proper Clause, right?  You say: But ""necessary and proper"" doesn't mean it's necessary and proper for the good of society.  It means it's necessary and proper for the execution of another power that the Federal Government is given by the Constitution.  Now, why is this necessary for the execution of any Federal power?  The Federal criminal proceeding has terminated.  The individual is released.  You could say it's necessary for the good of society, but that's not what the Federal Government is charged with.  Why is it necessary to any function that the Federal Government is performing?  It has completed its performance of the function of incarcerating this individual until he has served his punishment.   Antonin Scalia  General Kagan, I -- I find it difficult to believe that if the Federal Bureau of Prisons wrote the governor of the State into which this person is to be released, and they try to release him in the State where he -- he will in the future reside, and said, we are about to release this person in 60 days or whatever, in our view there are serious mental problems, and we think the State ought to consider commitment proceedings, I find it difficult to believe that an elected governor or an elected attorney general would ignore that letter.   Antonin Scalia  The governor is going to say that at the next election: It would have cost too much to put this guy up.   Antonin Scalia  You know, it costs $65,000.   Antonin Scalia  I must say I'm -- I'm not terribly impressed with -- with the argument--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the States won't do it.  [Laughter]  I mean, this -- this is a recipe for the Federal Government taking over everything.   Antonin Scalia  The States won't do it; therefore, we have to do it.  It has to be done, and therefore the Federal Government steps in and does it.   Antonin Scalia  What about release from the Army?  Would that -- would that also -- if I want to turn this -- this person after discharge at -- you know, loose upon the society, could the Federal Government commit that person?   ",08-1224

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no.  [Laughter]  The government can spend money on whatever it wants.  That's the spending power.  They can set up hospitals.  The issue is whether they can force somebody into a hospital, not whether they can set up hospitals.  I was going to ask you to tell us why the sky will not fall if we -- if we go the way you would like us to.  I assume that if the problem is that the States are unwilling to incur the expenses for these people, that Congress could pass a statute saying the Federal Government will pay the expenses of any prisoners released from Federal prison.   Antonin Scalia  And it seems to me that statute, combined with a letter to the elected governor, who probably wants to be re-elected, or the elected attorney general, will make it pretty certain that the State will take over the responsibility for the individual.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Don't -- don't States have involuntary commitment procedures?   Antonin Scalia  Now, couldn't the Federal Government fund a Federal -- would you find a constitutional problem in the Federal Government funding an office which brings involuntary commitment proceedings in a State where a prisoner is released when the Federal Government believes--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the prisoner is unsafe?

They're using a test nobody else used, that does not comport with -- with our prior opinions.  Why shouldn't we send it back and tell them, you know, use the right test?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you call it an ex post facto violation, but I -- I -- I rather agree with the government; it's a due process violation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --what happened is improper evidence was admitted, because it concerned pre -- pre-statute conduct.  But it might have been evidence that was -- that was irrelevant for some other reason.  That would be just as much of a -- a due process violation.  What is special about the fact that the reason the evidence before the jury was incorrect was that it -- the conduct occurred before the -- before the statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And when a State court allows pre-law conduct to uphold a conviction, that is an ex post facto violation, and we would reverse the State court judgment.  But that's not what occurred here.  What occurred here is that the trial court let the jury consider evidence, as evidence bearing upon conviction, which it should not have let the jury consider.  And there's a lot of evidence that a court should not have let the jury consider.  I don't see anything particularly special about fact that the reason this evidence shouldn't have been before the jury was that it occurred before the statute.   Antonin Scalia  And -- and, therefore, no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.   Antonin Scalia  There's also no violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, which is in Article I of the Constitution and which says no ex post facto Law shall be passed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't have -- you don't have an ex post facto law that was passed here.  You have an incorrect jury charge.  You have the judge telling the jury that you could convict on the basis of this prior conduct when, in fact, you couldn't.  That is not an ex post facto law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm looking for Marks, where is that in -- is that in your brief somewhere?   Antonin Scalia  You have mentioned several times the Marks case.  What case is--   Antonin Scalia  --Where is that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it in your brief?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, see, I don't know what that case is.  If it was a case in which we reversed a State supreme court because the State supreme court upheld the State statute that -- you know, that made prior conduct unlawful, then I -- I think I could say that was an ex post facto violation through the Fourteenth Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  This -- this evidence was improper because if the legislature had made that action punishable when it occurred before the statute was enacted, that would have been a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  Now, in fact, the legislature didn't do that, and, therefore, we have no real violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause.  But we do have the admission of evidence that shouldn't have been admitted, which is no different from evidence that should have not been admitted for some other reason.  For example, where the -- where the court gives an instruction that permits evidence to be considered as evidence of the crime which, in fact, is irrelevant to the crime.  And the jury says you can find him guilty if you find that he held two fingers up in the air, when, in fact, that has nothing to do with the crime.  Why is this any different from that?  It's just evidence that the jury should not have been allowed to use for conviction.  I don't see why there is anything special about the fact that the reason it shouldn't be used for conviction--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --is because it occurred pre-statute.   Antonin Scalia  Courtesy -- courtesy of Justice Kennedy, I have -- I have before me the Marks case.  And the -- the summary of the case at the beginning says:  ""Petitioners were convicted of transporting obscene materials in violation of the Federal statute. ""  ""Held: The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment precludes retroactive application to petitioners of the Miller standards. ""  It was a due process case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And, therefore, the Due Process Clause was violated when the court let that in.   Antonin Scalia  So you -- you have to persuade us that there is something special about a violation of the Due Process Clause that lets in evidence which is pre-statute, as opposed to violations that let in other evidence that should not properly be used to convict the defendant.  And I frankly don't -- don't see why it's so special.   ",08-1341

Frankly, one reason why I am inclined to think this is pretextual is that it is so weird to require the -- the campus Republican Club to admit Democrats, not just to membership, but to officership.  To require this Christian society to allow atheists not just to join, but to conduct Bible classes, right?  That's crazy.

Antonin Scalia  Wait, wait, wait.  Twenty years?  Do you have any evidence that this policy, the one we're arguing about now, that is to say, the all-comers policy, existed before CLS brought this litigation?  As I recall, the only evidence in the record is a letter from the dean describing this policy after the litigation began.   Antonin Scalia  Teach Bible classes?  Right?

Antonin Scalia  Mr. Sterling, I don't -- you seem to acknowledge that, to make your case, you have to show that Grand Rapids district drew from the pool a disproportionate number of people.  Why -- why do you have to prove that?  If Grand Rapids contributes to the pool an inordinate, disproportionate number of the minority -- blacks in this case -- even if Grand Rapids simply took back a proportionate number from the pool, it would still have a disproportionate effect on reducing the number of blacks in the overall pool, wouldn't it?   Antonin Scalia  But a step -- a step in the right direction is not enough.  You were adducing that to prove that the prior system had a significant effect, and it turned out, it didn't have a very significant effect.  It doesn't prove your point to say, well, it's a step in the right direction.  If it's insignificant, it's insignificant.  Whether it's insignificant in the right direction or the wrong direction doesn't matter.   Antonin Scalia  I still don't -- I don't understand this problem of -- of you have to show that they took back more than they contributed.  Let's assume that Grand Rapids is -- is entirely black, and its entire delegation that goes to the pool are all black, okay?  And let's assume that those blacks are 10 percent of the -- the totality, and there are no blacks from anywhere else, okay?  Then Grand Rapids takes back simply the number of people it -- it took, its set, which would be 10 percent, and it takes black -- takes back all of the blacks, who are the Grand Rapids residents.  All of the other districts would thereby have zero percent blacks instead of 10 percent, which is what they ought to have.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Exactly.   Antonin Scalia  Exactly.  So why expect the other districts to have 10 percent blacks simply because Grand Rapids contributed 10 percent of the totality, all of whom were black?  There -- then there's a requirement for each district to have 10 percent blacks, right?  But if Grand Rapids takes back its -- its -- the people it sent, there are no more blacks left to go around.

0,"Antonin Scalia  But did it use such language as ""appropriate relief""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, that's the question.  Our cases say it has to be clear to the State when they go into one of these schemes, it has to be clear what liability they are subjecting themselves to.  And in these other cases I think it was clear.  I don't think it's clear with simply the word ""appropriate relief"".   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but -- but, I mean, that means either that the Federal Government -- that the State government is liable for damages just as municipalities are, or that municipalities are immune to suit for damages just as the States are.  I mean, that -- you don't know which way that cuts, do you?   Antonin Scalia  Well, maybe let's talk about them, then.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I can conceive of a case where -- where the State's violation of RLUIPA consists of a State statute that simply deprives the individual of his rights under RLUIPA.  What State official would you -- would you sue?  It seems to me you couldn't sue the State legislature, so it would make sense to have an injunction against the State.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The word ""appropriate"" -- the word ""appropriate"" would -- would suggest that to me.  If -- if I'm a State attorney general, and I -- I know that the rule is sovereign immunity and -- and especially with regard to raids on the State treasury, I think it would be at least plausible that I would -- I would read ""appropriate relief"" not to include monetary relief.  And we have said -- the language from our cases -- Lane says a waiver of sovereign immunity must be unequivocally expressed in the statutory text and will be strictly construed in terms of its scope in favor of the sovereign.  That's -- that's a high test.   Sarah Harrington  --But even--   Antonin Scalia  And -- and although I might sit down and come out with a conclusion after intensive study that yes, maybe the best reading of this statute is that it allows money damages, I find it hard to say that it is unequivocally expressed in the statutory text.   Sarah Harrington  --Well, two things if I could, Your Honor.  In Lane v. Pena, the question before the Court was it wasn't -- it was outside the Spending Clause context, because the question was whether section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act applied to the Federal Government, and when the Federal Government applies, even in the Spending Clause context, conditions on itself there is no contract-like relationship.  But the second thing this Court said in Barnes--   Antonin Scalia  You -- you deny that it has to be unequivocal?   Sarah Harrington  --It has to be unequivocal, but -- but the context in which you are construing whether -- whether the sovereign is expressing its intent to waive its immunity is different when you are talking about the Federal Government applying obligations on itself than when you are talking about the Federal Government offering money to a State in -- in exchange for its agreeing to comply with--   ",08-1438

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Some of the Grimm's fairy tales are quite grim, to tell you the truth.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are they okay?  Are you going to ban them, too?   Antonin Scalia  That same argument could have been made when movies first came out.  They could have said, oh, we've had violence in Grimm's fairy tales, but we've never had it live on the screen.  I mean, every time there's a new technology, you can make that argument.   Antonin Scalia  An average minor is halfway between 0 and 18; is that 9 years old?   Antonin Scalia  I'm not concerned about the jury judging.  I'm concerned about the producer of the games who has to know what he has to do in order to comply with the law.  And you are telling me, well a jury can -- of course a jury can make up its mind, I'm sure.  But a law that has criminal penalties has to be clear.  And how is the manufacturer to know whether a particular violent game is covered or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does he convene his own jury and try it before -- you know, I really wouldn't know what to do as a manufacturer.   Antonin Scalia  What about excessive glorification of drinking, movies that have too much drinking?  Does it have an effect on minors?  I suppose so.  I -- I am not just concerned with the vagueness.  I am concerned with the vagueness, but I am concerned with the First Amendment, which says Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.  And it was always understood that the freedom of speech did not include obscenity.  It has never been understood that the freedom of speech did not include portrayals of violence.  You are asking us to create a -- a whole new prohibition which the American people never -- never ratified when they ratified the First Amendment.  They knew they were -- you know, obscenity was -- was bad, but -- what's next after violence?  Drinking?  Smoking?  Movies that show smoking can't be shown to children?  Does -- will that affect them?  Of course, I suppose it will.  But is -- is that -- are -- are we to sit day by day to decide what else will be made an exception from the First Amendment?  Why -- why is this particular exception okay, but the other ones that I just suggested are not okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I want to know what James Madison thought about violence.  Was there any indication that anybody thought, when the First Amendment was adopted, that there -- there was an exception to it for -- for speech regarding violence?  Anybody?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I gather that -- that if -- if the parents of the minor want the kid to watch this violent stuff, they like gore, they may even like violent kids--  [Laughter]  --then -- then the State of California has no objection?  Right?  So long as the parent buys the thing, it's perfectly okay.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  So that's basically all this is, is a -- a law to help parents, is that right?   Antonin Scalia  You should consider creating such a one.  You might call it the California office of censorship.  It would judge each of these videos one by one.  That would be very nice.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do we let the government do that?  Juries are not controllable.  That's the wonderful thing about juries, also the worst thing about juries.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Is it your position that all of the actions of the board, including those taken by the regional offices and by the general counsel and by everybody else, is inoperative once -- once the membership falls below three?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it has a separate -- a separate authorization for these three -- three-person adjudicatory panels as well, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  But that's a different argument from the argument you were starting off with, which, as I understood it, was once the membership of the board falls below the quorum of three, by reason of that, the three -- former three-member panels, of which there are now only two left, cannot act.  Is that your argument?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The membership of the board?   Antonin Scalia  The membership of the board?   Antonin Scalia  I understood that argument and I thought that was the only one you were making.  But you are making a broader one, that it also happens whenever the -- whenever the board's quorum disappears.   Antonin Scalia  So the regional offices can't function, of the NLRB?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can the board pay salaries?   Antonin Scalia  I'm really reluctant to rely upon this first argument that you are making, because I really don't know what it does to all of the functioning of the board.   Antonin Scalia  I didn't understand that.  Would you -- would you make that argument again?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't there another difference?  Is it not the case that the decisions of these panels can be appealed to the full board?  Are they automatically final?  Can the board not revise the decision of one of its panels?   Antonin Scalia  Well you -- you've got to tell me more than you believe in it, what -- what -- what is the case?   Antonin Scalia  The adjudication is final.   Antonin Scalia  There is no appeal to the full board?   Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's a totally different argument from the one that relies upon the size of the board, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even if the board were still properly constituted and had a full five members, if one of the three members to a -- a board should die, it would no longer be a three-member board and could no longer be, as your argument goes, the recipient of the delegation, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you are shifting arguments.  You can't keep jumping back and forth between the two arguments.  The one is that the appointing body has to still be fully constituted, or at least have a quorum, and the other one, which I thought Justice Alito was addressing, is the quite separate argument that the recipient of the delegation has to be three.  And when it falls below three it's only two.  And I don't know that you have a response to -- to -- to his point, with respect to the latter argument, except -- except that it's a different statute.   Antonin Scalia  If there is no legislative history, it could be true.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What's the use of having a five-member board, then?  I really don't understand what -- what has been accomplished--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --if you have a -- you are changing, oh, we had a three-member board, that's no good, we thought that's unfair.

Antonin Scalia  So knowing when it gave it to this three member panel that it would shortly become a two-member panel, and that thereby the board would be able to act with only two members instead of with three, which is what the quorum requirement for the board is.  I must say that seems to be a very strange procedure when you have a statute that says the board has to -- has to have three for a quorum.  When the board sees, oh, God, we are about to lose our third member, let's set up a three-member panel with this guy who's about to go off.  It will immediately become a two-member panel and then we can act with only two members.  That's wonderful.  It doesn't seem to you like an evasion of the whole purpose of the -- of the quorum requirement?   Antonin Scalia  Well, don't -- don't you think it is significant that the -- the vacancy clause that you were discussing -- where is it?  It's in (b).  ""A vacancy in the board shall not impair the right of the remaining members to exercise all of the powers of the board. ""  And it says nothing about a vacancy in the group not impairing the power of the group.

Antonin Scalia  Of the board.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it doesn't say that about the group.  That's my point.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  The -- this whole passage distinguishes between the board and the group.  I mean, it's -- it doesn't -- it doesn't mean the group when it says ""the board"" and the board when it says ""the group"".   Antonin Scalia  I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  The quorum for the group should be three, then.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  It depends.  I mean, if shutting down is the only way to put pressure on Congress to -- I mean, you may have a Congress that is just delighted to have only two Democratic members left on the board and all the cases decided by two Democratic members.  What possible incentive does that Congress have to increase the board to -- to the level that it should be?  None.  If you want to solve the crisis that you are so worried about, the only way to solve it is to say: Boy, you know, there is -- it's Armageddon coming; we are going to not be able to act at all.  That would solve the crisis.   Antonin Scalia  I'm much more impressed by -- by your opponent's assertion, which I don't think you have contradicted, that for many years whenever there was a death in one of the three-member panels, that panel was reconstituted.  A new person was appointed, instead of just letting it continue to operate with only two.  Doesn't that mean something?  Doesn't that suggest that these panels were viewed by the board as requiring three people?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they never did it when they had a full board?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whenever there was a death of one of the members of a three-judge panel or a three-member panel, they filled it and the panel did not operate with two?

And I don't know that our cases establish that you cannot continue the interrogation until there has been a waiver.

I'm not sure that -- that if I were there, even if I didn't want to talk right now, I might still want to listen, which is apparently what this -- what this person did.

If we agree with that, then all of these facts become relevant.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, it hasn't criminalized speech.  It has criminalized providing aid and assistance to these organizations.  Most of that aid and assistance that is prohibited is not in the form of speech, but it happens to include speech as well.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think that's quite different from a law that is directed explicitly at speech.   Antonin Scalia  That's not the right -- that's not the right number three.  The right number three is you cannot advise and assist an organization that is seeking to overthrow the government.  That's what is at issue here, not--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --not independently promoting the objectives of these terrorist organizations.  Your -- your clients are free to do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But when they assist the organization by providing advice, that's a different matter.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  When they provide a benefit, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, we -- we can cross that bridge when we come to it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is an as-applied challenge, and we are talking about the kind of advice and assistance that your clients want to give.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not a New York Times editorial.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It depends on what ""coordinating"" means, doesn't it?  And we can determine that in the next case.   Antonin Scalia  The end that Congress seeks to proscribe is the existence of these terrorist organizations.  And the theory of the legislation is that when you aid any of their enterprises you're aiding the organization.  Hamas, for example, gained support among -- among the Palestinians by activities that are perfectly lawful, perhaps running hospitals, all sorts of things.   Antonin Scalia  But that is what fosters the terrorist organization and enables the terrorist activities.  Why isn't that a reasonable connection?  Any assistance you provide to these organizations cannot be separated from assistance to their terrorist activities.   Antonin Scalia  I think it's very unrealistic to compare these terrorist organizations with the Communist Party.  Those cases involved philosophy.  The Communist Party was -- was -- was more than a -- than an organization that -- that had some unlawful ends.  It was also a philosophy of -- of -- of extreme socialism.  And -- and many people subscribed to that philosophy.  I don't think that Hamas or any of these terrorist organizations represent such a philosophical organization.   Antonin Scalia  That may be, but people joined it for philosophical reasons.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They joined it for philosophical reasons.  These terrorist organizations have very practical objectives.  And the only reason for joining them or assisting them is to assist those practical objectives.

And we're seeking to gain the assistance of these allies against those terrorists who aim their terrorism at us, and yet--   Antonin Scalia  --we -- we are supposed to allow our citizens to assist the terrorist organizations that are directing their violence against them?

Antonin Scalia  Unless you're in an overbreadth situation, a vagueness challenge can be an as-applied challenge.

The one may have been a stingier Congress than the other, or there -- there may have been more lobbying by one of the other groups in one case.  I don't see any reason why we have to philosophically reconcile the -- the granting of -- of greater immunity to Public Health Service employees.   Antonin Scalia  Just as a matter of curiosity, do all of these immunity provisions come out of the same committee?  Or can one assume that the Public Health Service may have come out of one committee of Congress, the Bureau of Prisons may have come out of another committee of Congress, the DOD may have come out of a third committee of Congress?

It is repealed.  The provision of it that says ""it shall be exclusive"" is repealed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Implicitly, because it's not specifically referred to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you say any -- any other civil action that -- that did not exist prior to the enactment of 233(a) would not be covered by its exclusion because Congress couldn't have known that this civil action existed, so that it only covered those causes of action that existed at the time the statute was passed?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  I mean, if your theory is it doesn't preclude anything they didn't know about, if they didn't know about something, whether it's constitutional or not, what -- what reason is there to say it's precluded?   Antonin Scalia  Legislative history will do, so -- so we don't require this clear statement, right?   Antonin Scalia  Legislative history will do the job, so you're abandoning the -- the proposition that there has to be a clear statement by Congress.   Antonin Scalia  That's what you said.  I thought you said if -- if it was clear from the legislative history that Congress considered Bivens actions and nonetheless enacted language similar to 233(a), that wouldn't be enough.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now you're confusing me again.  [Laughter]  Is -- is -- is important what Congress was thinking or what Congress said?  I thought your proposition was, unless the statute says that it bans constitutional actions, it doesn't.  Is that your proposition?   Antonin Scalia  Then it doesn't matter what Congress was thinking, does it?  Unless Congress says that, your -- your position is--   Antonin Scalia  --But, ah, but if it doesn't unambiguously bar it, you can then look to legislative history and say although it didn't bar it, the legislative history shows that it was intended to bar it.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well wait.  There's -- there's some sentencing stuff in -- in the first part as well.  There's sentencing stuff in (A).  You can't say that (A) deals only with elements and (B) deals with sentencing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, (A) says,  ""shall be sentenced to 5 years. ""  Or to 7 years, or to 10 years.  So there's sentencing stuff in (A).   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So does -- so does the language of (A)(ii) and (A)(iii), which is the same language: ""if the firearm is brandished""; ""if the firearm is discharged"" -- they all apply to a conviction for carrying the firearm.  There has to be a conviction before those things apply.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So that makes (A) the same as (B).  And -- and you don't claim that the elements in (A) are just sentencing elements, do you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But still and all, if -- if Congress were being precise and if the statute is to be read the way you suggest, the introduction to capital (B) should have been  ""if the firearm possessed by a person convicted of a violation of paragraph (A) above. ""  and then pick it up, ""is"", so forth.  Right?  I mean, that would -- would be more precise.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  I guess I agree with you that if (B) is -- if (B) is an element, (C) would be an element, too.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Isn't the old one in your brief, too, in your--   Antonin Scalia  --It's 3a of the government's brief.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, except that with -- with (C), you -- you could say that traditionally recidivism has been a sentencing factor, and you cannot say with respect to (B) that whether it's a short-barreled rifle or a machinegun has traditionally been a sentencing factor.  To the contrary, it was an element.   Antonin Scalia  Let's -- let's talk about the guidelines.  Without the application of (B), the guidelines would provide for a much shorter sentence, wouldn't they?   Antonin Scalia  The guidelines -- do you think that if under the guidelines the sentence was 30 years because of a machinegun, do you think that that would be upheld?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think it would be upheld as a reasonable sentence under our Booker/Fanfan theory of -- of how the guidelines are to be applied?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where -- where is the life sentence maximum, by the way?  I -- you say this is a minimum.  It's just a mandatory minimum because the maximum is specified to be life.  Where is that specified?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where -- where do you get the life maximum?  I -- I'm reading through, and there's -- it mentions nothing about life.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And if it mentions nothing about life, then these are not mandatory minimums.  To the contrary, they are -- they are new maximums.   Antonin Scalia  I don't find that implied at all.  I don't see why it's implied.   Antonin Scalia  That's right.  That's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That's her question.   Antonin Scalia  I think what you are exposed to, as I read the statute, (c)(1)(A) does not impose a new sentence at all.  It just says there will be added to whatever the sentence is for the crime of violence or the drug trafficking crime -- there will be added to that sentence.  Then it says you'll add 7 years; you'll add 25 years; you'll add 30 years.  Those are not mandatory minimums.  Those are add-ons to the sentence provided by the substantive crime to which (c)(1)(A) refers.  That way, the whole thing makes sense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'll amend what I said.  It is a mandatory minimum if the substantive crime referred to in (c)(1)(A) is above what is specified in -- in this statute.  But if it -- if it is below that, if the drug trafficking crime only provided for 15 years, and you did the crime with a machinegun, you get 30 years, that's an add-on.   Antonin Scalia  I got it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's also on 3a of the government's brief.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Right.

And then if the firearm, blah, blah, blah, is blah, blah, blah -- since your -- I assume that that introductory language  ""in addition to the punishment provided for. ""  is implicit in (B).  It's expressed in (A), but I think it's implicit in (B).   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In addition to the term that's -- that exists for the substantive offense.

1,"Antonin Scalia  What is -- what I was going to -- what is the purpose of saying ""who uses a communications facility""?  Is that purely a jurisdictional hook?   Antonin Scalia  Your argument sort of assumes -- more than sort of assumes; it assumes -- that facilitating is the same as aiding and abetting.  If they meant aiding and abetting, it's a -- it's a classic criminal law term, they could have said ""aiding and abetting"".  They didn't.  They used a different term, ""facilitating"".  Why -- why should I think ""facilitating"" means ""aiding and abetting""?   Antonin Scalia  What other -- this statute does not just apply to facilitating a drug offense.  It applies to any of the felonies covered by subchapter 2 of the relevant chapter.  I agree, it seems a little strange to have what is a misdemeanor by a buyer converted into a -- into a felony just by use of the phone.  What other situations under other felony provisions would arise that create a similar oddity?  Do you have any in mind?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand what you're saying.  The use of a phone may be more difficult?   ",08-192X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Not just that, he gets a felony on his record.  Before that he would have had just a misdemeanor; right?   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, what do you do -- the case that I find pretty close to what we have here is Rewis v. United States, which involved a statute that prohibited interstate travel with the intent to, quote,  ""promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate. ""  certain kinds of illegal activities, one of which would have been gambling.  And we said the ordinary meaning of this language suggests that the traveler's purpose must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity.  So it wouldn't have been facilitating a gambling operation simply to be engaging in interstate travel for the purpose of playing the tables.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, certainly, it focused on the word ""facilitate"".  That was the whole purpose of that passage.  It said -- it quoted  ""promote, manage, establish, carry on, or facilitate. ""  and the ordinary meaning of this language suggests that the traveler's purpose must involve more than the desire to patronize the illegal activity.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Don't you think that the ""knowingly"" in this statute also requires that you are knowingly facilitating?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So this is the same thing here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, this didn't mention -- this statute didn't mention purpose, either, did it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  An intent--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I find it pretty close, I really do.   Antonin Scalia  Except that the use of a phone in this statute is applied to the seller as well as to the buyer.  I mean, it seems to me it is parallel: use of a phone to commit the offense by the seller, and you want us to similarly sweep in the facilitating of the offense by the use of the phone by the buyer.  It seems to me pretty parallel to what we've done in the buyer-seller rule.   Antonin Scalia  Let's feel sorry for this -- for the felon who is selling this stuff, too.  I mean, the same thing is true of him, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Every time he makes another phone call he gets socked with another how many years?

Antonin Scalia  Well, that -- that -- now, you want to talk about what's a sensible system and what is not a sensible system.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it certainly -- it certainly makes these maintenance and care cases a lot more attractive to the plaintiffs' bar, doesn't it?  I mean, one of your complaints is there's just no money in it.  The claim is not for that much.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course it shouldn't be the goal.

I mean, what -- what if the seaman says, you know, I should have had this very expensive treatment?  And the shipowner's medical counsel said, no, this treatment is -- is not necessary.

But--   Antonin Scalia  --I assume it's--   Antonin Scalia  --I also assume the State law does not require that any -- any judicial decree with respect to a particular district be expanded to the whole State.  It seems to me you could comply with the State Constitution.  If and when a judgment is rendered as to the district, it would then be, under the State Constitution, the responsibility of the State executive to make sure that the other -- other districts are equalized.  But why the attorney general had to come into the Federal court and say, do it to the whole State, because the whole State has to be equal, I -- I can't understand that, to tell you the truth.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The fact is he wanted to be thrown into the briar patch, didn't he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The State attorney general wanted the decree.

But didn't the -- didn't the district court find that the funding for that plan is inadequate, for the two reasons that were mentioned earlier?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I -- I agree with that.  I think it was a vast mistake to extend a lawsuit that applied only to Nogales to the whole State, but the State attorney general wanted that done.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's -- that's water over the dam.  That's not what this suit is about now.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which would be good enough to fix Nogales.

Why shouldn't the courts decide that what constitutes a good faith effort is pretty much what Congress thought was necessary in the -- in the No Child Left Behind Act, and if you comply with that, you are doing okay?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Counsel, I--   Antonin Scalia  --I find it bizarre that we are sitting here talking about what the whole State has to do on the basis of one district which is concededly the district that has the most nonnative English speakers and has been a problem district all along.  And we are saying whatever this district court says for -- for this school district applies statewide.  Now, that is bizarre.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the mere fact that the State Attorney General acquiesced in that kind -- kind of a system at the outset, does that force us to still accept at this time that whatever is -- is necessary for Nogales is also necessary for the entire State?   Antonin Scalia  I'll let--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I'll let Arizona worry about that.  It's -- it's another matter to have a district court decree that the whole State has to do this thing.  And whether -- whether it's done equally or not would be a matter for the State courts to determine, instead of for this district judge to determine, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right but--   Antonin Scalia  --I understand that.  You could get the plan approved and then not fund it.  But at least the additional funding demanded by the district court should be whatever additional funding is necessary to comply with the No Child Left Behind Act.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then -- then it's not as simple as you made it.  Of course, I agree with the fact that if you get approved under the No Child Left Behind Act and then don't fund it, of course that -- that won't satisfy your obligation.  But if you have gotten approved, the test for whether you are satisfying your obligation should be how much money would it cost to implement the program that you have gotten approved under the No Child Left Behind Act.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't approve programs?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought the States had to submit a program.   Antonin Scalia  Right.

But at some point, at some point surely the two overlap.  I mean, suppose -- you know, you say simply because it is a bankruptcy action it comes within the bankruptcy clause and there is jurisdiction.  But what if the bankruptcy court in connection with the bankruptcy decrees that a totally unrelated company has to pay a certain amount of money and it's conceded that this company has no relation to the bankruptcy, but the court says, this is a national problem and this other company ought to contribute?

""An opportunity to present complaints with respect to any matter relating to the identification-- ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --to present the complaint to the principal.   Antonin Scalia  And it might make also sense to say that if the hearing officer has no authority to award a certain type of relief, neither does a court, under that general provision that--   Antonin Scalia  --That's right, but -- but with these new provisions, if the hearing officer doesn't have the authority to award the kind of relief that was awarded here, then the court wouldn't either.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you agree they go, as we say, in pari passu--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that -- that whatever the hearing officer can do, the court can do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and whatever he can't do, the court can't do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  (i)(2)(B)(iii)--   Antonin Scalia  --(i)(2)(B)(iii)?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's now (C)?   Antonin Scalia  (C)(iii).   Antonin Scalia  Let me be clear.  Am I correct that under -- under the theory of the statute that you are supporting, it would be possible for a parent, without first consulting with the school at all, to put the child in a private school and then later to request public school services, and when it is -- when they are denied or they are inadequate, all that public school -- private school tuition would be reimbursable?   ",08-305X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Yes, but you -- you want us to ignore the -- the State tax.  Do you really want us to do that?  I mean, it would be the easiest thing in the world for the State of Alaska, instead of imposing it at the State level, to authorize the municipality to do it.  I don't want to have this case to come back here for a second time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now -- now that the municipality is imposing the taxes that the State used to impose, don't you think you have to count both of them?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You are going to get a fragile judgment if -- if we go on those grounds.  All it takes is a modification of the -- of the legislation.   Antonin Scalia  Including a -- a cruise ship is covered.  I--   Antonin Scalia  --Was your answer to the Chief Justice that if there is a tonnage tax imposed on everything including -- including ships, it would still violate the Tonnage Clause.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's my -- it's my hypothetical.  I made it up.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you think it would be okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's only discrimination that counts?   Antonin Scalia  Well, there's some -- there's some fight about that, obviously.  There -- there is no fight about the fact that this tax is based upon how long the ship remains in port, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  How many days it remains in port.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which means, the argument could go that this is obviously a -- a tax for the use of the port.  And that's exactly what the Tonnage Clause was directed against, preventing Philadelphia and New York from taxing the consumers in New Jersey by imposing taxes on ships that bring in goods.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you don't think a daily -- a daily charge on vessels for remaining in port violates the Tonnage Clause?   Antonin Scalia  Is this anything else than that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not felt by the other States, felt by the consumers in other States.  Ultimately, it's not going to be the oil companies that pay this tax; it's going to be purchasers of oil.   Antonin Scalia  All of whom are going to be outside of Alaska, since this oil is leaving Alaska, right?   Antonin Scalia  It's a neat tax, you know, get somebody else to pay your taxes.   ",08-310X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Not fishing ships, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  None of -- none of Valdez's fishermen have to pay this tax at all?   Antonin Scalia  And nonmobile homes are not taxed as real property?   Antonin Scalia  So was all other personal property exempt from taxation.  They didn't have a personal property tax, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's nicely targeted as well.  But there is no constitutional impediment to -- to targeting the people of New Jersey through taxing the oil equipment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you can't -- you can't make vessels bear the overall burden of municipal governance.  You can make them bear the burden of the services provided to them in harbor.  But you cannot make them the instrument of funding all other municipal services.  That's what the Tonnage Clause means.   Antonin Scalia  You are counting the State tax as well, right?   Antonin Scalia  You are counting the State tax on oil equipment?   Antonin Scalia  Wait a minute, owed to the State for what?  What would be owed to the State?  It's still a State tax, and they are the collection agent, and it's a -- a credit against what they owe for their collections, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What -- what's it a credit against?  I don't understand what it's a credit against.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What does the city get a credit against?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --as referred to in the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Oh, I thought it was the city that got the credit--   Antonin Scalia  --Which is -- for a commercial vessel, is a rough calculation of how much it's worth.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The more cargo you can carry, the more valuable the commercial ship.   Antonin Scalia  It offended them aesthetically?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So all the State has to say is we are not -- we're not taxing you qua vessel.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, what--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Olson--   Antonin Scalia  --let me ask you something about -- about discrimination.  Let's assume that I think it is relevant whether the tax is a discriminatory tax, a property tax just levied on -- on ships or not.  If that is my position, why should I count as establishing nondiscrimination the fact that Alaska or Valdez is also taxing -- most of its other property tax revenue comes from taxing oil equipment, right?  And the burden of all of that tax, just like the burden of this vessel tax, is paid by people in New Jersey.  I mean, you know, that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It's getting somebody else to bear the burden of your taxation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Taxing that equipment raises the price of oil, almost all of which the oil goes out of Alaska and is paid for by people in other States.  Why should I count that property tax as proving that either the State of Alaska or Valdez is not being discriminatory?  Just because it -- it can't possibly violate the -- the Tonnage Clause doesn't mean that it isn't as much discriminatory against other States.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No--   Antonin Scalia  --And if -- if California taxed vessels, I would not allow California to come in and say, oh, we are just subjecting them to the same tax that our own citizens are subjected to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I wouldn't let them point to the Silicon Valley tax.   ",08-310X

Antonin Scalia  Is it any different from, from a (.) a Federal law prohibiting certain speech?

Antonin Scalia  A long time ago.  How much of the evidence that Congress amassed was specifically circumvention evidence?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not comparative, however.  Not comparative with the rest of the country except in (.) in--   Antonin Scalia  --Oh, let's talk about the bailout provision.  That (.) that was inserted in 1982.   Antonin Scalia  How many years is that?  Over a quarter of a century, there have been 15 bailouts that have gone through?  All of them in the State of Virginia?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You bring this before us as a justification for the legislation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's obviously quite impracticable--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --for anybody to bail out.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The question is whether it's right, not whether Congress rejected it.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It fends off Section 2 suits, I assume.  I mean, that's great.  You get a declaratory judgment, here (.) you know, a benediction, and you skip off without having to face suits.  That may be one reason.  Another reason may be that they like the packing of minorities and the other (.) the other districting tricks that can be (.) that can be pulled because (.) because of the requirements of the Voting Rights Act.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, they get elected under this system.  Why should that they take it away?   Antonin Scalia  I say, everybody who voted for this (.) this system was elected under this system.  Should it be surprising that they think it it's a good thing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We are not insisting that they (.) the other side is not insisting that they be kicked out.  If they want to voluntarily stay in, fine.  In fact, you should let other States and other jurisdiction opt in if they want to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you want to make this a voluntary system that's something entirely different, but the question is assuming a State or (.) or a covered jurisdiction does not want to be in, do you have the right to coerce them to be in?  That's all we are talking about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If they want to stay in, that's fine.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That was 1980?   Antonin Scalia  The bailout provision was adopted in 1982, 27 years ago.  There have been 15 bailouts since then.  Is that what you think Congress contemplated when it enacted the bailout provision in 1982?   Antonin Scalia  Less than one a year?   Antonin Scalia  What I understand it, is this incorrect?  As I understand it for Travis County to get a bailout, it would (.) it has within Travis County something like 106 political subdivisions that are covered, and Travis County would have to go to all of those 106 and demonstrate that there has been no violation by any of those 106 for the preceding whatever it is, five years, whatever the bailout provision is.  You think that's (.) you think that's feasible?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Travis County is not the superior of many of those subunits, as it is not of this district here.  This district is a subdivision of the State, but not of Travis County.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Adegbile, what was (.) I read it in the briefs, and I forget what it was.  What was the vote on this 2006 extension (.) 98 to nothing in the Senate, and what was it in the House?  Was--   Antonin Scalia  --33 to 390.  You know, the (.) the Israeli Supreme Court, the Sanhedrin, used to have a rule that if the death penalty was pronounced unanimously, it was invalid, because there must be something wrong there.

1,"Antonin Scalia  It wasn't granted then, and it still hasn't been granted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you have nobody before this Court with a live claim, neither the original named plaintiffs nor a certified class.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So who's here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What were they seeking to have enjoined?   Antonin Scalia  But -- I -- since they defaulted in the -- in the final hearing, how can -- can they possibly have any claim left with regard to an interim hearing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And they -- and they can do that before the -- before the time period has expired?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The statute is a dead letter if you allow a Slocum action.  All you -- all you need is a Slocum action, and the fact that the statute says you have to wait for -- you know, that the government has 40 days, is meaningless.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Exactly.  It's a way of defeating the statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the statute says the government isn't dilatory until -- until the time period, 40 days.  It has 40 days.  What does that mean if it doesn't mean that the government has 40 days?   Antonin Scalia  Before the 40 days?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay.  Well, that's a different story.  These people are asking for a hearing before the elapsing of the 40 days, and if all -- if all you say that Slocum provides is a hearing after the 40 days have elapsed and nothing has occurred, that doesn't satisfy what they are asking for.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't have to do anything for 40 days, is what the statute says.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you say if it -- you don't dispute that doesn't have to do anything, but you -- you assert that if it does nothing, you can bring a Slocum action.  I mean, which is it?  One or the other?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ten years?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ten years?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You've -- you've given up the position, then.  You've said time does matter.  So we are just arguing over what the time is, whether it's 10 years, 1 year, or 40 days, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It may be, but that's a different argument.  It's -- it's not an absolute.  It's -- we have to consider whether the time period is reasonable, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, what were they seeking to enjoin?   William M. Jay  It's not entirely clear from their complaint, Your Honor.  They were -- they were asking for the imposition of this 10-day hearing requirement, but it -- and they are -- they were contending -- now, each of these was filed after the 10 days had run.  The most recent seizure had occurred 2 months before the class action complaint was filed in district court.  So it appears they were contending that they wanted the forfeiture proceeding stopped because a hearing had not been held within 10 days.  So the complaint doesn't make perfectly clear what kind of injunction they were seeking except that they wanted the imposition of this 10-day procedure.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose a situation in which the property taken is really essential to the -- to the living of the person from whom -- who owns it -- a car -- and the person needs a car to get to work every day.  And -- and there is really no reason why the -- why the government has to wait that long.  Is there no procedure by which he can say, you know -- do it quickly.  You don't have to wait so long.  I'm the owner.  I'm the only owner.  I can -- I can prove that.  Let's have a quick hearing.   William M. Jay  --I think that as the Federal framework reflects, that is the kind of situation that is -- that can be addressed by legislation.  And the Federal hardship provision, 18 U.S.C. 983(f), is a good way of illustrating that; that the government has competing interests in all these cases that compete with the claimants' interests and in cases such as currency, where the government can't be secured against the possibility that the property will disappear, then -- then there's no hardship exception.  And -- but the government -- Congress, after extensive study, has made a hardship provision for other forms of personal property.   Antonin Scalia  I thought they didn't.  I thought some didn't have it returned, but there was a settlement.   Antonin Scalia  The mootness was not a result of any settlement between the city and--   Antonin Scalia  --Your -- your friend said the opposite.  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They got all of their property back?   Antonin Scalia  No, I don't understand.  They got their cars back, right?   Antonin Scalia  The people who had money at stake, what happened to the money?   Antonin Scalia  A settlement?   Antonin Scalia  So you have at least one case where the mootness is attributable to a settlement.  You have at least one plaintiff, and you can't get the kind of remand for mootness that you are asking for.

That is, you are assuming that the class is a valid class.  It hasn't been certified.  How -- how can you make that -- that argument when there is no class?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why -- why -- to -- to have an as-applied challenge, regardless of whether the Illinois law provides a -- a remedy, wouldn't you be able to individually assert under section 1983 unconstitutional action?  I mean, isn't there a Federal remedy?  If all you're concerned about is as-applied, you mean you are being treated unconstitutionally by a State and you have no remedy?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that enough?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they will know about the probable cause hearing that you want to -- that you want set up, right?   Antonin Scalia  Which -- which is why you are asking for a facial challenge.  You want these hearings in all cases--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --regardless of what the individual circumstances are; isn't that so?   Antonin Scalia  It is not so?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, what are the individual circumstances of all the other people in the class?  We don't know what they are.  We don't know whether it's a car that has been taken, money that has been taken, whether they are millionaires, whether they need the car.  We know nothing about them.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think -- you think it's unconstitutional as applied to everybody who is not given this -- this preliminary hearing.  That's -- that's what the complaint says.  Your -- the class you want certified is the class of everybody who has not been given a preliminary hearing.  I don't know the difference between that and saying that this statute is unconstitutional as applied.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, just -- just because you don't say in your complaint, this is a facial challenge, it amounts to a facial challenge.  You say, everybody who has not been given a preliminary hearing is entitled to relief because the statute is bad as to all of them.   Antonin Scalia  That is not the class you asked to be certified.  You asked to certify everybody who had been denied a preliminary hearing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't change this -- this action from a class action -- from a facial challenge into a nonfacial challenge.  They can't change your complaint.  You were either asking this to be struck down on its face, or you weren't.  And what -- what the Seventh Circuit did doesn't change that.

All the Federal Government is arguing is: We want to be the ones to enforce the separate Michigan law and the separate Hawaii law, right?   Antonin Scalia  You don't deny, do you, that the Federal Government can, if it wishes, enforce the State laws?   Antonin Scalia  So this provision isn't really contrary to what you are saying.  You are just saying the State can do it as well?   Antonin Scalia  I thought that was your position, that the -- that the visitation authority includes the power to enforce general laws.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Federal Government doesn't -- doesn't have the right to alter State law.   Antonin Scalia  I don't see any difference whatever in that regard between using the active and passive.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's not State law applying of its own force, just as your second example was not State law applying of its own force.  It was State law that had been converted into Federal law by the Federal Government's adoption of it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a different situation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You are arguing for conflict pre-emption.  I mean that's a -- that's a different issue than, say, that the -- the State law shouldn't apply.  But don't tell me the State law applies, but only the Federal Government is -- what incentive does the Federal Government have to enforce State law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It -- it has so much spare time after enforcing Federal law that it's -- it's going to be worrying about State law?   Antonin Scalia  That's conflict pre-emption, and that goes to the -- to the law.  You shouldn't have a separate State law that -- that provides a separate standard that conflicts with the Federal standard.  So you pre-empt the law.

Antonin Scalia  Would -- would you acknowledge, counsel, that there is a difference between enforcing State laws through visitation and enforcing State laws apart from visitation?

Antonin Scalia  No cavity search in school, no matter what?   Antonin Scalia  I assume a school can assign a student to study hall.  That's not considered a government seizure.  Isn't that an obvious part of the parental supervision that a school exercises, sit here and stay there.   Antonin Scalia  Schools do that all the time, don't they?

Antonin Scalia  Well, one of the defendants doesn't have qualified immunity.   David O'Neil  That's exactly right, Justice Scalia.

David O'Neil  Well, this Court could remand on Monell grounds for a hearing on that, which was not addressed in--   Antonin Scalia  You -- you have to, under your standard, have reason -- a reasonable suspicion specifically that -- that the student is hiding the contraband in the student's underwear?   David O'Neil  That's correct, Justice Scalia.   Antonin Scalia  Now, if -- if you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs and you search every other place, you search in the student's pack, you search the student's outer garments, and you have a reasonable suspicion that the student has drugs, don't you have, after conducting all these other searches, a reasonable suspicion that she has drugs in her underpants?   David O'Neil  No, Justice Scalia, we believe that you don't--   Antonin Scalia  All right.   David O'Neil  --without -- without--   Antonin Scalia  Your logic fails me.   David O'Neil  --Well, Justice--   Antonin Scalia  You -- you reasonably suspect the student has drugs.  You've searched everywhere else.  By God, the drugs must be in her underpants.   David O'Neil  --Well, Justice Scalia, you posited that the teacher began the search with reasonable suspicion.  And in that case, if you searched the obvious places like a wallet, a pocket, a desk, a locker, and you didn't find it in those places, the logical conclusion would not be that it must be in the student's underwear, but perhaps that the information that you had--   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  That wouldn't -- that wouldn't satisfy the test you've just given us.  I thought you said there had to be specific indication that she was carrying it in her undergarments.  And what Justice Alito posed was not that, just specific indication that she had it on her person.  Is that enough?  Do you want to revise your test so it's not just specific indication that it's in her undergarments, but specific indication that it's on her person?  That's enough?   David O'Neil  --No, Justice Scalia.  We believe that there must be information beyond that.  And I may have misspoke, and I think the answer to that question is that in that circumstance, a teacher would almost certainly ask, well, where on her person is it?  And if the student doesn't know, then, yes, Justice Scalia, that would not satisfy the standard that we would urge this Court to adopt.   Antonin Scalia  So there is a sliding scale for the dangerousness of what you're looking for?   David O'Neil  No.  It simply means that it's relevant to whether in the totality of the circumstances that school official could have reasonably suspected that the student was hiding it.   Antonin Scalia  Unless the people feel differently.   Antonin Scalia  Some school districts have rules against--   Antonin Scalia  --simply forbidding strip searches on any -- right?   ",08-479X

Antonin Scalia  So you want a sliding scale?   Antonin Scalia  As -- as I understand your -- your presentation, you qualify as a strip search any search that requires the outer garments to be taken off.  So it didn't really matter whether they required her to shake out her bra or stretch the elastic of her underwear?   Antonin Scalia  But is a strip search and -- impermissible along the lines you say, to require the student to even take off the outer garments?

Antonin Scalia  Normally where you are a fiduciary, it's up to you to prove that it was reasonable.   Antonin Scalia  So Congress evidently did not mean ordinary trust law to apply in this context.   Antonin Scalia  No, but he protects the company ultimately, because when investors leave the company that is charging excessive fees to go to other companies, the company that they are leaving sees that something's wrong and has to lower its compensation to its adviser.  Why doesn't that affect the company at issue?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Frederick, I don't understand your statement that they can't fire the investment adviser.  Maybe they can't fire him, but they can insist that he accept a lower fee, right?  Surely they can do that, can't they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can they insist that he accept a lower fee?  Can they do that.   Antonin Scalia  Why?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, no, that's something different.  Let's assume you have a disinterested board of directors, which is what the statute requires.  You tell me even though they are disinterested, they can't fire the adviser.  It seems to me, while they can't fire him, they can say: We are going to cut your fee in half.  Whereupon they don't have to fire him.  He will pack up and leave, and they will get a new adviser.  Doesn't that work?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it must be aware of the -- of the divergence between the fees that investment advisers charge to these companies and what they charge to other clients.  Isn't the SEC aware of that?   Antonin Scalia  And yet has brought no suits against this industry?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  For disclosure, just for disclosure.

And in the other two, where there was conferencing, the act also provides, as any sensible act would have to, for the adoption of procedural rules.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, we can't leave that for another day.  I mean, we -- we have to decide whether we are opening a Pandora's box here, whether there is any sensible way to restrict it to -- to deportation.  What about advice on whether pleading guilty would -- would cause him to lose custody of his children?  That's -- that's pretty serious.  What if pleading guilty will -- will affect whether he can keep his truck, which is his main means of livelihood, or whether -- whether it would be seized by the government as the instrument of his crime?  There are so many pieces of advice which involve legal issues that -- that counsel can provide advice on.   Antonin Scalia  Sure.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's -- that's -- with due respect, that's ridiculous.  If it's important enough to be required to be told to the defendant by his counsel, surely it's important enough to be advised to the defendant by the court before the guilty plea is accepted as voluntary, which includes knowing -- knowing the consequences.  It's a very strange line you draw between what we are going to hold counsel to and what we are going to require the defendant to be advised of by the court.   Antonin Scalia  I would think that the duty of the criminal lawyer is to make sure that the defendant's guilty plea is informed, it is an informed guilty plea.  That is the same obligation of the court in the colloquy, to be sure that it's an informed plea.  And if you say it's uninformed for counsel not to go into the myriad collateral consequences, then I assume it's -- it's -- it's improper for the court not to go into those consequences.  They both pertain to whether the guilty plea is informed.  That's counsel's responsibility.   Antonin Scalia  Well--   Antonin Scalia  --I thought he was asked what was in the -- what was in the containers and he said marijuana.   Antonin Scalia  What -- what about mis-advice as to whether he will lose custody of his children, or mis-advice as to whether his truck which he owns will be confiscated by the government?   Michael R. Dreeben  I would put them, Justice Scalia, all in the same general basket, which is to say, mis-advice on a legal matter of importance to the defendant that could skew his decision to plead guilty may be deficient representation under Strickland.  I think what--   Antonin Scalia  What are the consequences to the lawyer?  I mean, let's assume you are a public defender, and you are confronted with this situation.  Is it -- how -- how much skin is it off your teeth if you provide the advice, even though you are uncertain, and the advice turns out to be wrong?  What happens to the lawyer?   Michael R. Dreeben  I don't know that anything happens to the lawyer, Justice Scalia.   Antonin Scalia  So, what incentive is there to withhold uncertain advice?  Is there any incentive at all?   Michael R. Dreeben  Well, I think that--   Antonin Scalia  I mean, the worst that can happen is your client will get off.   Michael R. Dreeben  --There is the--   Antonin Scalia  He will make a guilty plea and afterwards it will be set aside.   Michael R. Dreeben  --There is a professional incentive to provide advice where you are competent to provide advice and not to provide it where you are not competent.  And I think that the focus on immigration consequences illustrates two things:  One is this is an extraordinarily complicated area of the law, where it is very difficult to give advice.  And for a lawyer to be expected to master not only the criminal aspects of the case but also the immigration aspects of the case will only tend to divert attention from what the lawyer is really there to do, advise--   Antonin Scalia  After -- after a mini-trial, which deprives the government of -- of its whole benefit from the guilty plea.  Governments accept guilty pleas in order to avoid the time and expense of going to -- to a trial.  And here you have to go back and find out what the evidence would have been, so that the court can make the decision you say is so easy.   Michael R. Dreeben  This is the typical regime that the Court has dictated under Strickland, and it has not proved unmanageable in the courts that have adopted the limited mis-advice rule that the government supports.   Antonin Scalia  But I'm not sure the parole eligibility could qualify as a collateral consequence.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It goes to the sentence.  It goes to what the sentence will be, which is certainly part of the trial.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why do you say that?  Where there has not been a revolution or what?  What -- how do you know?   ",08-651X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, but assuming it's a norm and that all lawyers do it, including those that know diddly about immigration law, the norm is to give bad advice.  And here -- here the norm was met, right?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought the point is that -- I thought your point was that -- that Strickland does require professional norms to be observed, but it is professional norms regarding advising a defendant as to the trial consequences of his plea as to those matters that are involved in the prosecution, and not as to collateral matters.  Isn't that your point?   Antonin Scalia  Those are the only norms that are relevant, what norms oblige counsel to advise a defendant regarding trial matters.   ",08-651X
0,"Antonin Scalia  So that's the question, whether that's enough or whether the government's power to prevent discovery, which it can do, is that alone enough?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  But -- but I'm saying there are various steps the governments -- the government can take, and I -- I think you have a point, that even though this case may be an easy one, we're going to have to decide in future cases how much -- how much activity by the government is enough activity to make the government a party.   Antonin Scalia  And if it turns out the government is not going to come in, you can always dismiss the appeal.   Antonin Scalia  Well, anyway, a rule's a rule and discussing all of these consequences is beside the point.  If, indeed, the government's a party, it's 60 days, right, and you say the government's a party?   Antonin Scalia  And is -- is it your position that the government is a party to this case for all purposes, for all purposes of all the rules, or is it just some of them?   Antonin Scalia  As opposed to the government's view, which does sort of pick and choose between--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, your argument goes -- is replying to the government the Respondent's argument that there is no sense in giving 60 days to the government, and what you're saying is, yes, sometimes there is.   Antonin Scalia  Even when the government has not actively participated.  So it really negates, you know, you're doing something that has no point.  It could have a point, to give the government 60 days, even in a case where it has not actively participated.  It may need that long to consult with other agencies as to whether to accept a defeat in this case or -- or on its own to conduct an appeal if the relator doesn't want to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm sure the government will agree with that.  I'm sure that's one of the contexts in which they agree that the government is a party.   Antonin Scalia  But there are some provisions that -- that seem to indicate the government isn't a party.  For example, it specifically provides that even when the government hasn't intervened, the government may request copies of the pleadings.  Doesn't it have to make requests for them?   Antonin Scalia  Well, why would it have to do that if it's a party?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're -- I mean, you're saying they are not a party for that rule at least, that requires the pleadings to be served upon the other party.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not following you.  I'm saying if -- if the government is a party, Rule 5 would apply and the government would automatically get copies of the pleading whether or not it requested them.  So the provision in the False Claims Act that the government will only get copies if it requests them seems to indicate that the government is not a party.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can I come back to the Rule 5 point just for a minute?  You say that the effect of the False Claims Act is simply to restrict what would normally be the right of the government to get copies of all the pleadings.  That's really not how it reads.  It doesn't say that the government shall receive copies of the pleadings only if it requests them.  It says the government shall receive copies of the pleadings if it requests them, as though without that provision it wouldn't have a right to receive copies.  Isn't that the way it reads?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's what we are down here, you know.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Precision.   Antonin Scalia  May be for other purposes?  I thought you told me before that it was for other purposes as well.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Let's stay on track.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where is that?  What provision is that?  I didn't focus on that.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I am sorry.  I didn't mean to eat up your time with this.   Antonin Scalia  I mean, where is it in the stuff that I have?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but that doesn't say anything about discovery in particular.  I thought you were talking about some declination provision that -- that said the government is -- is not subject to discovery.   Antonin Scalia  And -- and the fact that it cannot conduct discovery also involves the fact that it's immune from discovery, how do you get that?  And it is; is it not?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, I'm sure it's the government's position.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But how can that -- how can that be if it's a party?   Antonin Scalia  The declination provision doesn't say that.  The declination provision just says that it is not actively conducting the case.  But how do you get its exemption from discovery?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I agree with that, but -- but it's -- it's for me a problem with your assertion that for all purposes the government is a party.  It seems to me it is not a party for purposes of discovery, and there is no provision in -- in the -- in the False Claims Act that exempts it from discovery.   Antonin Scalia  I have a question for you, Mr. Wall.  [Laughter]   Jeffrey B. Wall  --I thought you might.   Antonin Scalia  What is the government's position on that point?   Jeffrey B. Wall  I actually wanted to start exactly where you and Justice Ginsburg began because I think we've gotten off a little bit on the wrong track.  If this Court wants a bright-line rule, the right rule is intervention.  Now, that would solve 98 or 99 percent of qui tam suits under the False Claims Act.  The government urged intervention as a prerequisite in Devlin, and this Court disagreed.  So the government left open the possibility in its brief that in a very small number of qui tam suits, on the order of 1 percent or less, it might participate, absent intervention, in a way that would justify treatment as a party under Devlin.  But whether or not the Court agrees with us on that -- a question not presented here where the government hasn't participated in any way -- the right rule is intervention, and it's just a question of whether this Court wants to make it cover 98 percent of the suits or 100 percent of the suits.   Antonin Scalia  Doesn't it need the 60 days to figure out whether it would want to intervene in order to be able to appeal?   Jeffrey B. Wall  --Justice Scalia, I think that would be equally true in a number of contexts -- for instance, class action settlements where the government is entitled to notice, presumably so that it can intervene; government contractor suits.  There are any number of Federal cases where the government might find the decision shocking and want to come in, but until it does, it's a non-party.   Antonin Scalia  But they are not statutes which give the government an extended period of time in order to allow the consultation.  This is a statute that does that.  And why would they -- why would they not envision the need for that consultation in the situation where the government has had no participation but comes up with a -- with a decision contrary to what it thinks the good law is, and it has to decide whether it wants to intervene in order to appeal.  Why shouldn't they be given 60 days?   Jeffrey B. Wall  Well, Justice Scalia, with all respect, the False Claims Act itself doesn't say anything about intervention.  It doesn't say anything about 60 days.  It just says the government has a right to come in and take over the action and run it and allow the relator to continue as a party.  And that's why it uses the word ""intervene"" -- because Congress understood that, in its accepted legal meaning, as a process by which a nonparty becomes a party, and the idea was to give the executive branch a choice.  In each qui tam suit, the executive is able to determine whether to assume the greater benefits and burdens of party status.  Petitioner is caught in the awkward position of saying that he thinks that the government is a party at the time the case is filed, not then a party for purposes of discovery, but even though it hasn't done anything, it's somehow a party again when the notice of appeal is filed.  And the government's position is that just where it does not come into the case and doesn't intervene, it's not a party for any of those purposes.   Antonin Scalia  But it is -- it is a potential appellant.  I mean if you say Congress is concerned about situations in which the government is a potential appellant.  It is a potential appellant in these cases until the 30 days have elapsed, at least.  It -- it can intervene, and why shouldn't it have the 60 days to decide whether to appeal or not?   Jeffrey B. Wall  I guess -- and I -- the same answer I gave earlier, Justice Scalia: That's equally true virtually in any Federal case that might affect the United States's interests--   Antonin Scalia  I understand, but this -- this goes to your argument about congressional intent: That they were concerned about preserving to the government time as a potential appellant to think the matter over.  It seems to me that argument is -- is a wash.   Jeffrey B. Wall  --But I think it goes back to what Justice Ginsburg asked much earlier, which is: At the time the judgment is entered, who is a party entitled to take the appeal?  If the United States has done nothing, it's not a potential appellant.  When the 30-day period runs, the case is over, and the United States, if it wants to--   Antonin Scalia  Can the United States intervene within those 30 days--   Jeffrey B. Wall  --It can intervene.   Antonin Scalia  --and then appeal?   Jeffrey B. Wall  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  I think it's a potential appellant.   Jeffrey B. Wall  Well, it is -- yes, and it is -- it is equally true that it is a potential appellant then in any case that might affect its interests.  But we do not commonly consider the United States a party to every class action settlement or in every government contractor suit simply based on the possibility that it may want to intervene.  When it does so very rarely -- we're talking about -- I mean that is the exceptionally rare case in the False Claims Act, and the government is saying, we can make that decision within the 30 days because we are not a party to the judgment at the time it's entered.  And, again, I think what Petitioner strains to do when he says at page 25 of his reply brief that when you decline as the government, you avoid the burdens of party status.  What Petitioner can't explain is why that is any different for the burden of appealing an adverse judgment and the burdens of discovery.  All of those rules speak in terms of party status.  If Petitioner is able to foist on the government a status that it actively attempted to decline, as was its right afforded it by Congress, then it seems to me Petitioner can equally try to foist on the government, though it doesn't here, in future cases party status.  And this Court will have to decide case by case: Is the United States a party for purposes of each rule of civil and appellate procedure?  And I think that approach threatens much more uncertainty than the approach the government is outlining where intervention is a simple, workable, administrable test to determine whether the United States is a party to a qui tam suit.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Except that the government here has considerable powers even without intervening, and they include its ability to move to stay discovery, which normally a party would only be able to do.  It can object to any voluntary dismissal or settlement, which normally would be a party's right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And some courts have allowed the government to move to dismiss.   Antonin Scalia  So unlike -- unlike your adversary here, you -- your adversary says the government is a party for all purposes; you are not saying the government is not a party for all purposes.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, the stated purpose is to promote the game.  The purpose is to make money.  I don't think that they care whether the sale of the helmet or the T-shirt promotes the game.  They -- they sell it to make money from the sale.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, it promotes the game if the money from the sale goes to the whole group, I suppose.  But -- but don't tell me that there is not -- absent this agreement, there would not be an independent, individual incentive for each of the teams to sell as many of its own -- of its own shirts and helmets as possible.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose that -- that could -- that issue could be tried.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But I don't -- I don't think so.

It wants its own adherents and wants to sell its own product.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you -- you say that the -- that the trademarks have no value apart from the -- from the game.  I guess you could say the same thing for each individual franchise of each of the 32 clubs.  They are worthless, if NFL Football disappears.  So does that mean they -- that they -- they can agree to fix the price at which their -- their -- their franchises will be sold, by concerted agreement, because after all, they are worthless apart from the NFL?

So that in a case of discovery where the defendant says, if I produce this I would be giving up a trade secret and it's not necessary for the case, and the judge says no, turn it over -- would there be in your view a right to interlocutory appeal in that case?  And if not there, then why here?   Antonin Scalia  The same thing with a trade secret.  It is a suit between another company who is a competitor of yours--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --And the Judge says, turn over your trade secret, the formula for Cocoa-Cola, and you say no.  No interlocutory appeal, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or do you say there should be an interlocutory appeal there?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Let's talk about predictability.  Once you make an exception for waiver, there is already that limitation.  It's not absolute.  Maybe it can be waived.  Secondly, you have to worry about a district court finding it to have been waived, even though it really wasn't.  That's another point of doubt.  And, thirdly, you have to worry about the Supreme Court affirming a district court that wrongly found it to have been waived because we give, you know, weight to the fact-finding of the -- of the district court.  Once you -- once you factor in all of those uncertainties, you are not talking about a -- you know, about a fail-safe privilege at all.

I thought if -- if there's counsel in a particular case and you want to approach the client about that case, you can't do it without going to counsel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But when there is an entirely different case, there is totally different litigation, you can't approach the fellow without going back to the counsel whom he hired for a different case?  I don't think that's the ethical rule.  But that's the effect of Edwards.  Even if it's a different crime, you have to go back to the counsel whom he hired for a different prosecution?  That bears no relationship to the ethical rules of -- of counsel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What if -- what if we limited Edwards to the same crime?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That didn't look like improvement to me.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think -- I think it was swallowing the worst evidence.  It was telling the jury that was going to think this is a hateful person who had done hateful things.  I agree with you.  I accept all of that, but even if you feel that way, I thought it was a brilliant closing argument.  You said you've -- you've conducted many capital cases.  Have you ever conducted a capital case in which the defendant takes the stand with a Hitler moustache and says he's glad for what he's done and he will do it again?  How many cases have you had like that?   Antonin Scalia  This was an extraordinary trial, and it seems to me that the -- that the technique that -- that counsel used to try to get mercy for this fellow was -- was the best that could have been done.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So I think that we have to defer to all of those, right?   Antonin Scalia  I think, if they could have been relying on any of those, we would have to defer to all, wouldn't we?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  One-by-one, I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --Why would we assume that?   Antonin Scalia  When we -- when you don't know what a lower court has done, the rule is you assume the best, not the worst.  Isn't that the standard rule of review?   Antonin Scalia  You, very often, don't know on what basis the lower court took action.  You assume it was a lawful basis.   Antonin Scalia  Which insulates it from being overturned.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that is not what AEDPA says.  AEDPA says that we have to give deference unless it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.  The burden is on the appealing defendant to show that it was an unreasonable application.  In case of doubt, he loses.  Now, AEDPA could have been written differently.  It could have been written the way you want.  The Supreme Court shall evaluate the reasonableness of the Supreme Court opinion.  It isn't written that way.  It says the burden is on you to show that this was an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.  And where there is a summary disposition, that's a hard road aho.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's -- it's not impossible.  I think there are cases where -- where relying on prior Supreme Court law doesn't get you there.  It's not impossible.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So we should revise the statute and it should not say unreasonable application of Supreme Court law?   Antonin Scalia  Why doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  That's not how the -- that's not how the statute reads.   Antonin Scalia  That's not what it says.  It says that you have to show that it is an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law.  That's what it says.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And if they can't, you lose.  Because that's the way the statute reads.   Antonin Scalia  You want to say if they can't, we have a new statute.  But we don't.  The burden on you is to show that it's an unreasonable application.

0,"Antonin Scalia  What do you mean by a ""for-profit commercial market""?  You mean anything that is sold, right?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Well, of course it is.  I mean, you can't separate the means from the end and say, since its end is simply to prevent the -- the activity, the means, which is to prevent the communication, is okay.  It is targeting the communication of videos that depict this conduct.   Antonin Scalia  Child -- child pornography is obscenity as far as I am concerned, and it has been treated as part of that same traditional classification which there has always been permission for the government to prohibit.  This is something quite different.  I mean, you know, what if -- what if I -- I am an aficionado of bullfights and I think, contrary to the animal cruelty people, I think it -- they enoble both beast and man, and I want to persuade people that bullfights are terrific and we should have them.  I would -- I would not be able to -- to market videos showing people how exciting a bullfight is.  Right?  I would be able to talk and say, oh, you should really allow bullfights, but I cannot make the most significant point that I want to make, get people to watch it.   Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  Wait.  I don't understand that.  Any depiction of bullfighting is educational?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that is true because Congress said so?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I guess a dogfight is educational, too.   Antonin Scalia  So noneducational bullfighting would be prohibited?  If I market this just because I think, boy, bullfighting is really exciting?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  It is covered.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""Or killed"".  How do you limit ""killed"" to cruel -- you say in your brief that it's noscitur ex sociis.  But that's a doctrine that says when you have a string of words, one of which has various meanings, which meaning it has depends upon the words with which it is associated.  So if you speak of staples, staples -- what, thumb tacks, nails, and other fasteners, ""nails"" obviously doesn't mean toenails.  It means a nail that is a fastener, the word ""nail"" having various meanings.  ""Kill"" has one meaning, which is kill.  And you can -- you cannot limit that meaning just because in addition to killing you also prohibit torturing and other things.  Do you have a single case where -- where that doctrine is used not to give meaning to an ambiguous word, but to limit the meaning of a word which on its face is absolutely clear?   Antonin Scalia  What is that?   Antonin Scalia  Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, it's not susceptible to a wide -- that's my whole point.  It means kill.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Some people think eating an animal is animal cruelty.  These people don't eat meat because it is the product of killing animals.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it shouldn't have said that, then.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't have a single case in which a -- an absolutely clear word like ""kill"" is given a more narrow meaning because of other words that are different from that word.   Antonin Scalia  But the first order problem occurs in states where it is not illegal.  These videos are taken in states where bullfighting or dog fighting or cock fighting is entirely legal.  So, I don't know how you distinguish a -- a movie which many people think that violence in movie brutalizes people and causes violence in people's action.  Why couldn't Congress, persuaded by these people say, you know, you can't have -- cannot depict torture?  You know, these horror films that come out around Halloween, you can't depict that anymore.  What is the difference between that and what you have done here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Who knows.   Antonin Scalia  If you dress up like an ancient Roman, the whole thing is of historical interest?  [Laughter]  Is that it?   Antonin Scalia  A different category.  That is traditional First Amendment law that obscenity is not protected.  And child pornography, as far as I am concerned, and I think as far as the Court is concerned is obscenity.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  His message is that getting animals to fight is fun.  That's his message.   Antonin Scalia  To say he -- you know, he can convey that message in some other way, how else does he do it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Simulated dog fights would be okay under this statute?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand.  Are you saying, since there is no human sacrifice in this country and no market to be dried up, the videos would be okay?   Antonin Scalia  Yeah; but we don't have any human sacrifice.  Nobody's doing that stuff.  So you could not proscribe the human sacrifice channel.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's just not significant value; significant artistic, educational.  What are the others?  Scientific?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Strictly entertainment value doesn't count, does it?   Antonin Scalia  And most of the hunting videos I have seen people watch for the entertainment.  They like to see a hunt.   Antonin Scalia  It could be that the reason hunting videos are still out there is that the producers were quite confident that this Court would not allow them to be prohibited on the base of a statute such as this.   Antonin Scalia  I really think you should focus, Ms. Millett, not on the educational value for -- to make people hate bull fighting and things, but on quite the opposite, it seems to me.  On the right under the First Amendment of people who like bull fighting, who like dog fighting, who like cock fighting, to present their side of -- of the debate.  And unless it's a subject like obscenity, which from the beginning has not been considered protected speech, it seems to me that side of the debate is entitled to make its point as -- as forcefully as possible.  That's it seems to me what the problem is here.  Not--   Antonin Scalia  --You can create a lot of First Amendment horribles.  What about -- what about a new Adolf Hitler?  Can we censor any depiction of that new Adolf Hitler and the horrible things that he is proposing, including extermination of a race?  Is that proscribable under the First Amendment?  Is that any less horrible than the human sacrifice contemplation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I would have thought that your response to Justice Breyer's comment about catering to people's worst instincts in the area of the First Amendment, at least, would have been that it's not up to the government to decide what are people's worst instincts.  If -- if the First Amendment means anything, that's what it means.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not up to the government to tell us what our worst instincts are--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Except for those areas that have traditionally been outside the area of -- of protected speech, and -- and once you allow this one, what other -- what other base instincts do people have, besides this one?  One can contemplate a lot of other areas, where government could say, You are appealing to people's worst instincts, and, therefore, the -- the movies cannot be made.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Right.  But -- but when the administrator has interpreted the plan incorrectly and the court finds -- the court of appeals finds that he has interpreted it incorrectly, it doesn't have to send it back and say, you know: Give me another bid; try something else.  It says: You did it incorrectly, and we find that what you should have done is this.  Isn't that what normally happens?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So all a court can do in those trust cases is to say: You've got it wrong, Sam; go back and do it again.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And he gets it wrong again, and he goes back to court; the court says: Sam, it's still wrong; go back and do it again.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can't believe that that's what the law is.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, why -- this is important to me, whether the plan administrator was interpreting the same language when this case was remanded back down.  Originally, he was simply applying the methodology that had been specified in 1990, right?   Antonin Scalia  And the court said that was no good because you didn't give these people notice of it.  But that -- he had been applying that test not since 1990, but since 1980.  In other words, he had taken that to be a reasonable interpretation of the very summary language in -- in the plan itself, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So when it went back, why didn't he stick with that and say: Yes, they didn't have adequate notice of that, but that is still a reasonable interpretation of the original plan, even before we specified that.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  Why did he do that?  Inasmuch as the first interpretation was not adopted in 1990, but it was adopted under the same language that he is now interpreting in 1980, right?  He was applying it between 1980 and 1990.  That's what he thought he -- that's what he thought the plan meant in all those years.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  After 1990.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, I didn't understand.  I didn't understand it.   Antonin Scalia  Well, your -- your brief says:  ""The Plan Administrator has consistently applied the reconstructed account methodology since the early '80s. ""   Antonin Scalia  '90> [""] --  ""1990, the Plan language requiring this methodology provided as follows. ""  So I took that to mean there was no such language before that?   Antonin Scalia  There was plan language requiring it before 1990.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  That's -- that's what I thought, and I thought you said no when I asked that question, that this detailed description of the RAM didn't come in until 1990.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh -- oh, I see.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I got you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you claim -- you claim that what he is interpreting when it comes back to him is not the same text that they invalidated--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --but rather it's the plan without this text.   Antonin Scalia  The court of appeals said it's just an application of equitable principles--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --not an interpretation of the plan.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, yes.   Antonin Scalia  One -- well, I thought you said what this affects is just the floor; it doesn't affect the level of the -- of the defined contribution.   Antonin Scalia  What if I don't think it's the same terms?   Matthew D. Roberts  If you don't think it's the same terms, that would present a -- a different question about whether deference was required.  But still deference would have been inappropriate here, because the fallback interpretation by the plan administrator presented the same notice problems that the original phantom account interpretation had provided, because the summary plan description didn't provide notice that there would be an appreciated offset.  But the rule that the court of appeals adopted was that deference was not required when it was the same terms, and the court of appeals found that.  I don't think this Court needs to -- in resolving that, to decide whether it was the same terms here.  We think it -- it was, because the -- the Petitioners made two arguments in defending their initial benefits determination.  One was we can apply the post-1998 terms, and the other one was, even applying the 1989 plan, that authorizes use of the phantom account, because of the non-duplication of benefits provision.  And now they have come back on remand and they're saying well, no, we're now reading the non-duplication of benefits provision differently.  And that's the -- that's the same plan terms.   Antonin Scalia  So, in principle, if -- if we accept your argument, if other retirees who are later rehired bring a lawsuit in another court, you might have a different result because it would be up to the -- up to that court to decide what was -- what was a proper result, right?   Matthew D. Roberts  In the--   Antonin Scalia  That's the consequence of not deferring to the plan administrator.  You have--   Matthew D. Roberts  --If the plan -- if the plan terms -- in an ordinary case, if there was an abuse of discretion in interpreting the plan terms, the plan terms would still address the issue.  There wouldn't be an additional violation of ERISA's notice requirement.  This is a unique case, in the sense that, here, you've got not just an arbitrary -- an unreasonable interpretation of the plan terms, but you've also got the problem of the lack of notice in the summary plan description, and you've also got the problem that the plan terms are really silent on this issue.  They just don't say anything about how to calculate the offset.   Antonin Scalia  --Can we go back to the urns?  [Laughter]   Matthew D. Roberts  --Well, that's essentially -- that's essentially the -- the principle that we're -- that we're talking about--   Antonin Scalia  Well, we interpret gaps in -- in documents all the time.  That's part of interpreting a document, figuring out what it provides for in a lot of situations that it does not explicitly cover.  I don't know why that isn't interpreting the plan.   Matthew D. Roberts  When -- the analogy here is to the trust law situation, where trusts -- where -- where courts modify the terms of a trust because the terms are illegal or there's a change of circumstances, like the cy pres doctrine.   Antonin Scalia  But the court of appeals held that this one was inadequate because it did not say that you were going to take into account the time value of money.  If that's the reason it held that this one was bad, the same reason would apply to the plain vanilla.   INTERRUPTING ",08-810X

Now, you may have a different point, if -- if you say that what -- and it seems to me you did say this, that the court of appeal -- the court of appeals, not only decided that there was no notice and, therefore, this provision wasn't any good, but you claim that the court of appeals also said that you cannot account for the time value of money.

I think the main -- the main point is whether the FCC could stop it -- the SEC could stop it if it wanted to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Never mind ""Right now, it cannot"".  If it issued a rule that said you need our approval--   Antonin Scalia  --It cannot issue such a rule?   Antonin Scalia  Why not?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They could do that, couldn't they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, let's talk about whether it can't or not.  Why can't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Don't -- don't you think that's what it means, though, realistically?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When you no longer have responsibility to perform a government -- governmental act, you no longer have authority to perform it.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think the government will think it has achieved a great victory if it comes out of this with the proposition that the SEC is not an independent regulatory agency.  And I don't think the government is arguing that position.   Antonin Scalia  ""For cause"" doesn't mean for failure to obey the President's instructions, does it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's why it's called an independent regulatory agency, because it's not subject to presidential control.   Antonin Scalia  I'd love to say that.  That would be wonderful.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is not an argument you have made anyway.  Can we go on to the arguments that you've made?   Antonin Scalia  Thank you.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  The President has adequate control over the SEC only because he can dismiss the chairman of the SEC.  But the activity here is not governed by the chairman of the SEC.  There's no role whatever for the chairmanship.  The -- the governance of this board is by the members of the SEC.  So that's quite different from saying -- you know, I -- I think your syllogism breaks down at that point.   Antonin Scalia  The chairman, which is -- which is -- which is the -- what should I say -- the knife that the President has into the SEC, has no role in the control of this board.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me, but, you know, Congress -- Congress can change the statutory authority of any agency just like that.  Does that mean that Congress is controlling the agency?   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure that -- that the ability to take away responsibility for an agency -- from an agency is the same as controlling what authority that agency does exercise.  It seems to me they are two different things.   Antonin Scalia  No, that's--   Antonin Scalia  --But that's not true.  He can remove -- he can remove the chairman of the SEC.   Antonin Scalia  And he cannot -- he cannot remove the commissioners.  And it's the commissioners that govern the board, not the chairman.   Antonin Scalia  Would you please change it?  Right?   Antonin Scalia  I could do that.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I did, I did.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  We did overrule it, by the way, in -- in Morrison, didn't we?   Antonin Scalia  General Kagan, the government argues here that the head of department is all of the commissioners.  Elsewhere, it is the chairman of the SEC who -- who appoints inferior officers.  Now, which is it?  Are all those appointments by the chairman invalid?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's something quite different.  He makes the appointments.  They can overturn it, but the appointment must be made by the head of the department, and the appointments are not made by the commissioners.  They are made by the chairman.   Antonin Scalia  Do you know any other agency composed of inferior officers that has the power to acquire its own budget, as this board does, by simply assessing a tax upon the people that it regulates?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The SEC can overturn it, but it's up to the board -- the board can do it.  Do you know of any parallel situation where there is a, supposedly, agency composed of inferior officers who have the power to tax the public unless it's overturned by somebody else?   Antonin Scalia  But you can say the same -- you can say the same thing about Congress.  I mean, this is not the kind of control that an executive officer normally is supposed to have over inferior officers; when they do something, you can take away their authority.  --Congress can do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which is nothing, which is nothing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- when I was OLC, I would -- I advised the President, you can't interfere with -- I think, if the President called up the FCC and said, I want you to rule this way, I want this kind of a rule from the FCC, I think there would be an impeachment motion in Congress.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Congress set up that agency to be independent from the President.  That was the whole purpose of it, wasn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's okay for him to ask them?  It's okay for him to suggest to an independent regulatory agency that this is how he wants something done?

What's the third?   Antonin Scalia  What would you think of a rule that said where most of the delay is attributable to the defendant, he doesn't -- he doesn't walk?  That seems like a reasonable rule.  Whatever the delay is, if most of it is attributable to the defendant himself, it is -- it is not a basis for dismissing the indictment?

Is it -- is it in the brief somewhere?  You know, it's nice to know what we are talking about.  When -- when you are relying on a section, it would be nice to have it in the materials.  I mean, I guess I could send for it, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --So it really doesn't matter what ""under"" means, right?  I mean, even -- even if you accept the other interpretation of ""under"", to wit, that it includes regulations pursuant to the subchapter, your point is that this regulation is not even pursuant to the subchapter.   Antonin Scalia  I understand.  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Why -- why would it -- I don't -- the big obstacle I find with your position is that it doesn't make any sense.  Why would Congress want to exclude review for discretionary judgments by the Attorney General that are recited explicitly to be discretionary in the statute, but provide judicial review for judgments that are just as lawfully discretionary because the Attorney General is given the authority to make them discretionary and has done so?  I mean, a discretionary judgment is a discretionary judgment.  Why -- at least if it's a legitimate one, I can understand why you would say discretion which is given to the Attorney General under the statute, as opposed to discretion which he has wrongfully assumed, but -- but both -- both exercises of discretion are just as lawful, right, under the statute?  One is explicit in the statute, and the other is pursuant to the authority of the Attorney General to make it discretionary.  Why would Congress want the one to be subject to judicial review and not the other?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, and I'm saying: Why is it a rational line to say -- I think it's a rational line to say, when lawful discretion is being exercised, since it's a discretionary judgment, you're not entitled to it anyway, and therefore, we won't review it.  That makes some sense.  And I -- but where discretion is lawfully exercised, why would -- why would Congress go, Oh, when the discretion is lawfully exercised because the statute says so, we have one approach, but where discretion is lawfully exercised only because the statute allows the Attorney General to prescribe discretion, we will not allow?  I don't understand why -- why it would want to do that.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you -- you don't -- you don't contest that the regulation can provide discretion.

""Disgruntled"" and the opposite of ""disgruntled"" is ""gruntled"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So why is this different?  I mean, it's clear that ""property"" can mean that.  You acknowledge that it can mean the government's entitlement to money from taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it can mean that.  Now why -- why should we say it doesn't mean that here?   Antonin Scalia  Is the word ""property"" used in the antitrust laws?   Antonin Scalia  What does it say?   Antonin Scalia  And it -- and it's clear that for purposes of the antitrust laws, property does not include the government's entitlement to income from taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but that -- that's something different.  This isn't just the general, you know, you hurt the economy and therefore you hurt the State.  Here, what they're saying is: You caused people who owed me taxes not to pay taxes, an identified sum of money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it might have been inchoate but still -- they would have to be prove that, I assume, in the litigation here, wouldn't they?  I mean, let's assume we let the litigation go forward.  Wouldn't they have to prove what taxes were not paid?   Antonin Scalia  So worry about that later.  I mean, just because some of them might be difficult to prove or not provable doesn't mean that the rest that are very clear do not constitute property.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a different issue.   Antonin Scalia  You're going to talk about that one, aren't you?   Antonin Scalia  You've got it.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Why should that help?   Antonin Scalia  So how can you call it -- I mean, part of the problem with calling it property is there -- there is such a low chance of recovery of the amount owed here.  Even if the Jenkins Act filing had been made, you still have to -- have to assume that this -- number one, you have to assume that the State would turn the list over to the city, which the State isn't required to do.

But, secondly, after you get the information we have to assume that you're going to move against these people.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you follow up by writing them a letter and what your footnote 8 says is, when you wrote them a letter, about half of them coughed -- coughed up the tax.

On the seller's part or on the New York buyers' part?  They will be -- the New York buyer is doing it because it's cheaper because he is not going to pay taxes on it.  But it seems to me the seller couldn't care less whether the buyer pays taxes on it or not.  So long as he pays the money for the cigarettes, the seller has gotten what the seller wanted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Usually you're not liable for misrepresentation unless it causes -- it's relied on.  You really think that the -- that a large percentage of the people who were getting this stuff really, really were gulled into believing that New York State was somehow being done out of taxes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Really?   Antonin Scalia  No, I am sure the purchaser knows: I'm not going to pay taxes, even though I should pay taxes.  But you're -- you're telling me that the only reason the purchaser doesn't pay taxes is because of this misrepresentation that you don't have to purchase -- you don't have to pay taxes.  I've known a lot of New Yorkers, and not many of them are that gullible.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I'm -- I'm not sure.  Let's talk about the contraband cigarette trafficking.  I'm not sure that these people would be in violation of it.  It makes it unlawful for any person knowingly to ship or transport, also receive, possess, sell, distribute, or purchase, cigarettes which bear no evidence of payment of applicable State or local cigarette taxes.   Antonin Scalia  But there is no applicable State or local cigarette tax upon the shipment of these cigarettes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not what it says.  It makes it unlawful to knowingly ship it when they bear no evidence of payment of applicable taxes, and--   Antonin Scalia  --there is no applicable taxes at the time that they ship it.

Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose the question under the statute is whether it would be a reasonable attorney's fee, and I guess one way to determine that is to ask whether it would be considered reasonable if a law firm that billed a client according to their regular hourly rates came in and said, but we're going to kick it up another -- you know, another $10,000 because this -- this second-year associate, boy, he's a whiz, and he performed like a senior partner.  So we are going to -- we are billing him at the $500 rate, instead of the $200.  Would -- would that be considered a reasonable attorney's fee?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I didn't think so.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or, indeed, you don't know that the brilliance of the second-year associate enables the $500-an-hour partner to spend less time on the matter.  Presumably it does.  It's so great when it comes to him, he doesn't have to do much work.   Antonin Scalia  You are saying we can never exceed the lodestar amount?

Antonin Scalia  What are you referring to, if not attorney performance?   Pratik A. Shah  Right.  The government sets out one example in our brief of where we think an upward enhancement might be appropriate, and that's where an attorney takes on a particularly unpopular client or cause that causes some external harm, external to the case, to his practice or income, where--   Antonin Scalia  You think that's what we had in mind, huh?  You think that's what we had in mind when we said they are extraordinary circumstances?   Pratik A. Shah  Well -- well, Your Honor, I--   Antonin Scalia  I think it's very imaginative, but I would never--  [Laughter]  --but I would never have thought of it, and I doubt whether we did.   Pratik A.

And I think it is--   Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander.  [Laughter]  I mean, if -- if you get rewarded for unpopularity, you ought to be get penalized for popularity.  You got a lot more clients because of this case.   Pratik A. Shah  Well, Your Honor, I don't think there is any basis in the -- in the private market for that sort of downward adjustment.  Justice Sotomayor, if I can address your concern about these alternative arrangements that -- that occur in -- that are starting to emerge -- at least Respondents suggest in their brief to this Court by citing a few newspaper articles and the proverbial word on the street that these are an emerging trend.  First of all, there's no -- absolutely no evidence in the record in this case that those type of arrangements were available in the relevant market.  But even if they were, those sort of alternative arrangements are essentially modified contingency arrangements.  And this is made most clear in Respondents' own amicus brief, the brief of the law and economic scholars.  And this is at page 10 and 11 of their brief.  They call these partial contingency or hybrid contingency arrangements.  It's not the same standard hourly rate and then a client decides to throw in a kicker of a million dollar bonus.  Rather, these are discounted rates with a success bonus, essentially a modified form of contingency arrangement.  They are prohibited for exactly the same reason that this Court prohibited a contingency risk enhancement in Dague.  The same reasons would prohibit relying on those sort of alternative arrangements to provide an attorney enhancement for performance.   ",08-970X

I think that's much more objective than whether -- whether this attorney is the best one I've seen in 28 years.  I have another problem with it.  I don't like judges -- it's certainly not in the tradition of the bench to comment upon the performance of lawyers.  I can't tell you how often I would like to give a separate grade for--  [Laughter]  --for the lawyer who won a case.  You know, one grade for the case and the other for the lawyer.  But we don't do that.  And if you do this going up, you've got to do it going down.  And you could expect the judge to say: This is the worst performance I have seen in 28 years.  Judges don't do that in our system, and I don't think -- I don't think we should set up a mechanism that induces them to do it.   Antonin Scalia  You say discretion.  I say randomness.  I mean, that is not a matter of discretion.  It is a matter of randomness.  How -- how long has the judge who observed this case been on the bench?  If he has been there just a couple of years, kiss good-bye to your -- your extra money for being excellent.  That's random.  That's not discretion.   Antonin Scalia  So you want this Court to look to those cases -- you know, it's the world turned upside down.  Instead of the lower courts reading our cases, we have to read lower court cases to decide what this statute means.  Is that it?   Antonin Scalia  I don't do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, this statute was passed before we adopted the lodestar approach, wasn't it?

I find it very easy to get from the opinion of the court of appeals the proposition that if there is discretion, it's not a firmly established rule.  Where do you get your theory, that they had changed it from a discretionary rule to a mandatory rule at the time that the State court made this ruling?  Where do you find that in the opinion of the court of appeals?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's -- that's a different issue.  Now, your -- your assertion is that what the court of appeals was based on -- decision was -- was not this that you are arguing now, but rather, it was based on the fact that there had been a change in the law from discretionary to mandatory.  I can't find that, frankly, in the opinion, except in its reference to Doctor, so I have got to go back and read Doctor and guess that that's what they meant when they referred to Doctor.  But assuming it's true, Justice Breyer says, even if it is true, what difference does it make?

The trial court thought that it had discretion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's clear from the trial court's opinion, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  And they concluded that was ridiculous, so they stopped doing it.   Antonin Scalia  Before or after his execution?  [Laughter]   ",08-992X
1,"Antonin Scalia  There is another discretion that you don't seem to object to.  You say that one -- one way the debtor can get out of the bind that he's put in by the fixing of the confirmed plan is simply to move for a revision of the confirmed plan.   Antonin Scalia  What constrains the judge in allowing or not allowing the revision?  Doesn't he have the same kind of discretion with regard to the revision that you're objecting to with regard to his establishing the payments?   Antonin Scalia  But that's the same thing that's being argued here, that -- that you start with the fixed calculation based on the 6 months before and then you have to show that there were some extraordinary circumstances that justify a change.  I don't see that there's any difference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What your case comes down to is the bankruptcy court can do this, but it has to do it by simply revising the plan, not by establishing the plan initially but by revising it.   Antonin Scalia  Maybe?   Antonin Scalia  That was a friendly question.   Antonin Scalia  Can I--   Antonin Scalia  --Can I come back to Justice Ginsburg's question about whether there would ever be the opportunity to adjust the confirmed plan?  Because as you say, the plan here would not have been confirmed, but that -- that isn't the case always.  I mean, in many cases a plan would be confirmed because the -- the bankrupt could -- could barely make the payments that it requires; and then when it -- it is clear that, because of the extraordinary event in the preceding 6 months, the bankrupt is -- is not going to have that -- that amount of money, there would be the opportunity to adjust.   Antonin Scalia  In other words, is your response to Justice Ginsburg ""always"", that it will always be the case that where there would be an adjustment under this theory, there would not have been a confirmation in the first place?   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask -- yes, there is one more question.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask whether 1323, which you have now invoked, does not provide the same kind of discretion to the court that you are objecting to?  What -- what standards are there for granting or not granting modification of the plan?  Is it pretty much up to the judge?   Antonin Scalia  Well, then -- then -- okay.  You are between a rock and a hard place.  Either 1323 gets you out of that formula, which is what you've said, it's one way out, or it isn't.  Which is it?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So any -- any amendment has to relate to a period--   Antonin Scalia  --subsequent to the filing.   Antonin Scalia  Well, ""know will happen"" is quite different from ""likely to happen"", and I thought your test was likely to happen.   Sarah Harrington  Well, likely to happen based on what you know now.  I think -- we haven't suggested a particular burden of proof.  I think--   Antonin Scalia  Not -- not likely, based on what you know.  Well, that's quite different from you know it will happen.   Sarah Harrington  --Right.  So there is an example mentioned earlier: If the debtor is repaying a loan to her 401(k) program, that is the type of loan that can't be extended time-wise.  And so she will keep making those payments, which will be deducted as an expense in the calculation of her current disposable income, but -- but you know at a certain point, she is likely to stop making those payments.   Antonin Scalia  Is there a difference between your test and the Respondent's test?   Sarah Harrington  Not according to what I heard Mr. Goldstein say at the argument.  Again, we do not mean to suggest that a court should use--   Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's ""know will happen"".  That is ""know will happen"".  But I don't know how you can, at one and the same time, say: Courts shall not speculate, and then say that the test is ""likely to happen"".   Sarah Harrington  --Well, again, in this--   Antonin Scalia  I mean, to -- you know, to look forward and say: Is it likely or not likely?  That's speculation.  I don't know a better definition of speculation, to tell you the truth.   Sarah Harrington  --Okay.  But then, we wouldn't -- we are not trying to advance that view of ""likely"".  And again, in this case the change had already occurred, so there is no uncertainty about what her situation is now and what we can project it to be going forward.   ",08-998X

1,"Antonin Scalia  Gee, I thought Bowles was a nice, clear case.  I mean, you could always find some distinction in the next case, and I thought the object of Bowles was to say if it's a limit on appeal, it's jurisdictional.  That would -- and that's, I gather, what the Federal circuit took it to mean.  And I would have done that if I was down there, probably.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't the Social Security context -- it doesn't speak of an appeal, does it?  It talks of a civil action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you're right that there is -- you know, there is a parallel in what's going on, but the statute does not call it an appeal.  It calls it bringing a civil action to challenge the decision.   Antonin Scalia  Go ahead.   Antonin Scalia  Although that -- although that would happen when he appeals from the -- from the veterans' appeals court, right?   Antonin Scalia  But this one to get to the Veterans Court is 120 days, which is a lot of time.  Do you know of any other time limit that is that long?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, for appeal.  For appeal.  Do you know of any other appeal statute--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, the latter I can understand, but I don't have a whole lot of sympathy for -- I mean, when he loses below he gets a notice that says specifically he has to file an appeal with this Court, doesn't it?  Doesn't it say that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So he sends it -- he sends it to the VA instead of to this Court?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would equitable tolling even cover that situation?  It would seem to me -- I'd say it told you where to file; you simply didn't follow the instructions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that--   Antonin Scalia  --They don't navigate it entirely on the system.  I mean, isn't there usually assistance from a nongovernmental organization such as the American Legion or--   Antonin Scalia  --That's right.  Do they drop them like a hot potato once the VA portion is over?  They don't counsel about how to file an appeal?   Antonin Scalia  And you think normally he is not assisted -- he is not assisted by one of these people?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not talking about a lawyer.  I'm talking about advice from somebody that's in the American Legion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So whenever we have time limits in the future that do not contain any explicit provision for waiver of failure to meet those time limits, you are asking us to find that all of those are non-jurisdictional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, is it a filing requirement?  It's -- it's--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It's an appeal.  It's a requirement for appeal.  Whenever there is an appeal deadline that does not have an exception for -- you know, you -- you can get it extended for 10 days or what-not -- whenever there is no exception, you want us to hold it's not jurisdictional?   Antonin Scalia  Although you are willing to -- to have that happen when there is an appeal from -- from the first appeal, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, why give them notice?

So it -- it ought to be a question of -- of what this language ought to be taken to mean.  What's its fairest reading?  Now, I'm not sure that means you win, but -- but surely that's the issue, not -- not what, whether -- whether Congress could have been so mean.  They didn't think of this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You -- you say that a copy of the notice is also sent to the representative, the American Legion or whoever, who has been representing the veteran?   Antonin Scalia  Did Congress -- let's assume we -- we come out with a decision against the veteran.  Could Congress change the rule retroactively, including for this poor fellow.   Antonin Scalia  And that wouldn't be contrary to any of our decisions because the Government is the defendant and is essentially waiving its sovereign immunity?  Would that be the case?

Antonin Scalia  So can Congress say, you know, go back and do it over again and give it to this guy?

Now, I'm not going to go back and answer a hypothetical question of whether, if the Ninth Circuit said on the basis of those facts alone before the California court, if the Ninth Circuit had said that, would that opinion be affirmed?  That's not the opinion they came up with.  They added facts.  So it seems to me that you have to live with what they wrote.  And the basis of their decision included additional facts.   Antonin Scalia  That's your very point, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Page 35.  I spent all that time.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Kennedy, can I bring you back to page 35?  The -- the court of appeals opinion, Ninth Circuit's opinion, says accordingly if 2254(e)(2) were linked to the scope of the evidence before -- it would exclude only the new mental impairment theories -- the new mental impairment theories introduced in Federal court, and their exclusion would not affect our result.  The State contends that there -- there was other factual material, not just those theories but also the 6-and-a-half-hour time sheet evidence.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So at least, you know, that really doesn't cover the waterfront of -- of all new evidence.   Antonin Scalia  To say that they were on record in the State court is not to say that they were part of the record, of the trial record.  And these things were not part of the trial record, right?

""The new mental impairment theories introduced in Federal court. ""  That that's the only new evidence that would be -- would be excluded.  And the other side contradicts that.   Antonin Scalia  How do you believe that, you have nothing to support it.  I mean, I'd say that's just lawyer's puffery, unless you come up with a record that shows 6.5 hours.

Would that have to be reported?  And if not, why not?   Antonin Scalia  Fine.

If -- if that's the only product they make, you say, totality of the circumstances, that may be enough?   Antonin Scalia  I don't know if scienter is -- it seems to me ridiculous to -- to hold companies to -- to irrational standards; and we did -- and we did say in -- in Basic that it's viewed -- whether it would be viewed by the reasonable investor.  And -- and you are saying well, the reasonable investor takes account of the irrationality.  I don't think that's what we meant in -- in Basic.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Frederick, I'm -- I'm not clear on why you can draw a distinction between materiality and scienter for purposes of the issue before us here.  If, indeed, satanic effect is enough for materiality, you say, well, it may not be enough for scienter.  Why?  I mean, if the company knows that satanic effect is material, then the company has -- knowingly withholds it because it thinks satanic effect is irrational, why doesn't that company have scienter, if it's material?  The scienter is withholding something that is material that is known to be material, and once you say that -- you know, that Satan is material, if the company thinks Satan is involved here, it has to put it in its report, no?   Antonin Scalia  So there's no difference between the materiality issue and the scienter issue.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You can't push this problem off onto the scienter side of the equation.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Shah, what do you think about Satan?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They haven't said that.  They haven't said that our sales are going to double.  They're just walking along at normal sales.   Antonin Scalia  And they find out that 10 percent of nutty-nuttys out there are not going to buy their stuff because of Satan.  What about that?   Antonin Scalia  So the government's position is that reports of adverse effects that have no scientific basis, so long as they would affect irrationally consumers, have to be disclosed, assuming the company has said we're doing well, right?

How -- how would it--   Antonin Scalia  --How does that change when you -- when you alter the hypothetical so that he was already an employee of Stanford, but was not working as an employee of Stanford when he was at this other company?  You could still say that -- that Stanford was not the inventor.   Antonin Scalia  Plus the word ""retained"", don't forget that, too.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But this isn't vesting it in the United States.  This is -- this is speaking of the -- the university retaining title.  If -- if the government was going to make such a huge change from normal patent law where the inventor owns his invention until he assigns it to his employer, why wasn't that set forth clearly?  All they needed was one paragraph.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It says when you're working on a -- on a government-funded project, you have no right to your invention as an -- as an employee.

Antonin Scalia  Well, I think what Arizona would answer to that is: Well, that's the only option the Federal Government left us.   Antonin Scalia  They excluded everything else.  We might have used reticulated penalties or, you know, enforced the Federal law ourselves, but they forbade that.  But they did allow us to enforce the law, immigration laws, through licensing, right?  So it all essentially comes down to -- to the licensing issue, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  That would be remarkable only because nobody would think that with this scheme in place, the Federal Government would not enforce it.  Of course no one would have expected that.  But what Arizona says has occurred here is that the scheme in place has not been enforced, and Arizona and other States are in serious trouble financially and for other reasons because of -- of unrestrained immigration.  And therefore, they had to take this very massive -- I agree this step is massive, and one wouldn't have expected it to occur under this statute, but expectations change when the Federal Government has -- has simply not enforced the immigration restrictions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It could have named that, if that's it meant.   Antonin Scalia  It could have named that, that particular licensing scheme, if that's what it meant.  But it didn't name it.  It said licensing generally.  What did it intend to add to that?  Barbers' licenses, beauticians' licenses?  How would any of this have anything to do with the immigration laws?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what they are saying.  That's exactly what they are saying.  We -- we have--   Antonin Scalia  --I think it's very common to talk about authority to do business within a State as -- as a license.  You say ""licensed to do business in"" so many States.  It's a common expression.  Now, I have -- maybe you will persuade me otherwise, but I have no doubt that insofar as this law limits the authority to do business within the State, it is a -- it is a licensing law.  It's a little harder extending licensing to formation of a corporation, but when you issue a corporation charter you really do two things.  You create the corporation and enable the limitation of liability that creates; and secondly, you authorize that new creature to do business within your State.  So at least half of that corporation law is licensing, it seems to me.  Now, if that's what I think, what--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.  Go on.   Antonin Scalia  But you do not need the kind of a document that an out-of-State corporation needs.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Don't depart from that.  What does that mean, ""enforcement shall be uniform""?   Antonin Scalia  What does that mean, ""enforcement shall be uniform""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that any different from--   Antonin Scalia  --from what is the assumed situation with respect to all Federal rules?  Are Federal laws not to be applied uniformly?   Antonin Scalia  I don't see the problem in diverse adjudication.  Wouldn't there be a Federal question presented if a company claimed that it was deprived of the ability to do business because of a mistaken interpretation of Federal law, that the person it hired was not an authorized person?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wouldn't that be a Federal question that -- that could be--   Antonin Scalia  --Doesn't the State law basis refer to the Federal law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought it tracked it.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Are you saying, and I think the Petitioner here may have been saying as well, that if you have a licensing law that permits the revocation of the license, the revocation is not a licensing law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose I have a licensing law which says if you do this your license will be revoked.  Does that remain an a licensing law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why make exception for licensing laws therefore if you can't evoke a license under it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once you are in you can do whatever you like, you think that is what Congress meant?  You can pass upon their fitness when you issue the license, but once its issued they can do whatever they like, is that what you are telling me?   Antonin Scalia  And revocation.  Okay.  So that raises the question what does it make, why does it make any difference if the revocation provision is contained in the narrow licensing law or if there is a general State law which says all licenses that are issued may be revoked for certain reasons?   Antonin Scalia  So they should just -- Arizona should just amend all its licensing laws to require what they now require when the license is issued, and to say in each specific licensing law, that it can be revoked for the same -- on the same.

Are you conceding that any variation from the Federal standards for -- for criminal and civil liability is automatically precluded?  I mean, as I read the exception, it's an exception for State licensing and similar laws.  And it doesn't say,  ""So long as those licensing and similar laws go no further than what the Federal government has done. ""  I mean, we often allow States to impose regulatory requirements that go beyond the regulatory requirements that the Federal government has imposed, and that is not automatically considered to be preempted.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's an extraordinary proposition.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Mann, do you assume there is always a reason for Congress's not passing a law?  I mean, it's hard enough to figure out their reason for passing a law, but there could be an infinitude of reasons why a law is not passed.   Antonin Scalia  Do you know of any case in which the failure of Congress to amend a law in order to overrule a court decision other than a decision of this Court has been held to be an implicit approval of that decision?  Do we have a single case where we said, oh, there was a line of court of appeals cases and since Congress failed to amend the statute to take account of those court of appeals cases, Congress must have approved them.  Do we have any case like that?   Antonin Scalia  I don't know of any.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Mann, I thought you disagreed with the premise of Justice Ginsburg's question; that is, that you assert that the language related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency is quite clear.

1,"Antonin Scalia  It might just be somebody going to the toilet, right?   Antonin Scalia  So, you have to suspect that the reason the toilet is flushing is somebody is trying to get rid of evidence.  And in order for that to be the case, you have to have smelled marijuana?   Antonin Scalia  What if -- what if the defendants here had not flushed the evidence down but had answered the door and said, ""Yes""?  Would the policeman have been able to do anything just because they had smelled marijuana?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, yes, but they say: Oh, heck, no, you can't come in; do you have a warrant?   Antonin Scalia  So basically the -- the police were taking advantage of the stupidity of the criminals, is that right?  That's terrible, that's not fair, is it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, after -- after they've heard the movement inside or the flushing or whatever, you can't just kick it in because you've smelled marijuana.  Can you do it, because you -- you knock on the door because you smell marijuana, nobody answers, and you kick the door in?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but without that noise.  Just--   Antonin Scalia  --No, of course not.   Antonin Scalia  Why -- why not?  I mean people -- you know, when there's a knock on -- on the door, is the normal human reaction to walk into the other room and shut the door?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's peculiar behavior, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Is that a common experience, that you knock on a door and all you hear is somebody walking out of the room and shutting a door?   Antonin Scalia  I don't recall it ever happening to me, but maybe -- maybe I'm a likable fellow and people open the door.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They could say: Go away.  They could do a lot of stuff.  But walk in the other room and shut the door?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Strange.   Antonin Scalia  You don't know that they're destroying evidence unless you have reason to believe that there is contraband inside.  I mean, the -- the hypothetical is an unrealistic one.  They knock on the door and somebody moves inside, that doesn't give them any--   Antonin Scalia  --Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's a different hypothetical.  There's a hypothetical in which--   Antonin Scalia  --they knock on every door under which they smell marijuana.   Antonin Scalia  Perfectly okay.

Is that a Fourth Amendment violation in and of itself?   Antonin Scalia  So your -- the -- the unlawfulness test would not prevent that?   Antonin Scalia  It would not?  Oh.  Maybe we have to come up with an unreasonable test, then.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it'd be okay for officers to do that?  Pretend they have a warrant?  Open the door or we'll kick it in.

Is -- is saying ""Open up, police"", is that unlawful?   Antonin Scalia  Miss Drake, the problem I have is there are a lot of constraints on -- on law enforcement, and the one thing that -- that it has going for it is that criminals are stupid.  [Laughter]  And we had a case some years ago in which the issue was whether the Washington police could enter buses arriving from -- from the south and -- and randomly ask passengers, do you mind if we look in your luggage?  And the -- the -- the mules who were carrying marijuana were stupid enough to say: Oh, of course, just to show that they had nothing to fear.  And an enormous number of arrests were -- were effected in that fashion.  We didn't say that's not fair because you're taking advantage of the -- of the ignorance of these -- these poor criminals.  We said that's perfectly okay.  And it seems to me the same thing is going on here.  These people could have answered the door.  There's a policeman knocking on the door.  All he's saying is open the door, open the door, say, yes, what do you want?  Say, you know, blah, blah, blah.  They say, well, get a warrant.  Shut the door.  They didn't do that.  But everything done was perfectly lawful.  It's unfair to the criminal?  Is that -- is that the problem?  I really don't understand the problem.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But I -- you -- you -- you might have considerable support on the Court for the proposition that if the exigent circumstance is created by unlawful activity by the police, which would include conveying the impression that they are about to kick the door in, then -- then you have a different case.  But -- but I thought the case we had before us is what if the police officers are behaving perfectly lawfully and they're not threatening to kick down the door, and they smelled the marijuana and then they hear the motion inside, does that justify their going in?  And that's what I thought we took the case for, and that's a different question.  You're trying to -- you're trying to make the police officers' actions unlawful, and I will stipulate that if their actions were unlawful you have a different case, and probably the evidence would have to be suppressed, but I didn't think we were here to decide that, whether they knocked too loud, whether they threatened to kick in the door.  The opinion below says if they created the exigent circumstances whether they did so lawfully or unlawfully, they cannot go in -- and that's, that's the issue.   Antonin Scalia  That wasn't the basis for the decision below, though.  The court below didn't say these police officers were behaving as though they had a warrant and were about to kick in the door.  The opinion below just said, yes, there were exigent circumstances, but they were the result of the police knocking on the door and saying we're the police.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you have any doubt that it's unlawful for a police officer to threaten to burst into a home?   Antonin Scalia  So why do you need unreasonable?

It's not that every -- every contract which -- which has a benefit for some person allows that person to sue.  There has to be an intent.  And I -- I have trouble finding that intent here, either on the -- on the part of the Secretary -- would the Secretary have had that intent when -- when Congress clearly did -- did not have the intent to allow private individuals to sue?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, you didn't hear my question.  My question was the mere fact there's a duty to a third party in the normal contract does not give that third party the right to sue, only if the contracting parties intend the third-party beneficiary to have the right to sue.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I--   Antonin Scalia  --But the government's footnote doesn't -- doesn't rely on the contract.  It says that -- and it wasn't purporting to say the basis that the court applied in the District of Massachusetts case, but it was explaining why, in the government's view, it is a different situation.  And what it said is it is a different situation, not because of a different contract, but because in that other situation, Medicaid -- the Medicaid rebate -- Medicaid generally is, quote, ""a cooperative Federal-State program"".  I mean, the point is that the States are explicitly given authority for enforcement in that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And here the entities you're representing are not.   Antonin Scalia  A big -- a big difference, it seems to me, Mr. Frederick, is that the States are sovereign.  They can enforce their own laws.  The entities at issue here are not sovereigns.

Anything that would embarrass the corporation is -- is a privacy interest?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Anything that hurts the -- the -- the image or the goodwill of the company?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Klineberg, can you give me any example of -- your -- your brief talks a lot about the adjective ""personal"".  But we're not talking just about the adjective ""personal"".  We're talking about the phrase ""personal privacy"".  ""Personal"", yes, can indeed apply to corporations sometimes; but there are certain phrases where it clearly does not.  For example, you talk about personal characteristics.  That doesn't mean the characteristics of General Motors.  You talk about personal qualities.  It doesn't mean the qualities of General Motors.  You talk about a point of personal privilege.  It's not a privilege of a corporation.  And I think personal privacy is the same thing.  Can you give me any examples in common usage where people would refer to the personal privacy of a -- of a corporation?  It's a very strange phrase to me.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I'm not talking about that.  I'll grant you that -- that ""personal"" could refer to a corporation, although the government distinguishes it by etymology and so forth.  Never mind that.  I'm talking about personal privacy.  Do you have any examples from the New York Times, from, you know, Boswell, from anywhere, that anybody refers to the interests of a corporation as the ""personal privacy"" of General Motors?  I cannot imagine somebody using the phrase like that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Another reason might be that personal -- nobody ever thought that personal privacy would cover this.   Antonin Scalia  But if Attorney General Levy's description, which was -- which was issued for the purpose of telling all the agencies of the Federal government what this new statute meant -- and it had a lot of ambiguities in it -- if that was wrong about -- about this subject, you would have thought somebody would have objected.

The government -- the government is blowing the whistle; it is the government which is saying, you are in default, and under the law, since you're in default, we can walk away, and indeed we can claim the money we've already paid you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That seems to me the moving party in the -- in the context of a contract.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Reynolds was talking about that because that was the fact situation in Reynolds.  But I'm saying that the logic of the matter, the logic of the matter when applied to a contract situation such as this ought to be the party who is blowing the whistle, who is trying to use the law -- the one -- the one who is asserting that -- that the law requires this result, and then we say, well, we can't tell whether the law requires this result or not.  That, it seems to me, ought to be the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It wasn't the undoubted right of the government before the lawsuit was filed.  It was the undoubted right of the lawsuit only if the contracting officer was correct that there had been a default.  If he was wrong about that, it was not the right of the government.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but they -- they claim that you knew that it was impossible to do what they contracted with you to do at the weight of plane which they promised to come across with.  They say that you knew that because of -- of other contracts that you had had, and yet didn't -- didn't tell them about it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't know whether that's true or not, and we're never going to know it's true, because you came in and blew the whistle and said: State-secrets privilege.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are you saying it was not impossible to do it at that weight?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  At the weight contracted for?   Antonin Scalia  I don't care how the contract's written.  I mean, if we're going to -- if we're going to say that there's been a broken play, that we're not going to try to apply the contract because we can't tell who's in the right and who's in the wrong, it's totally irrelevant what the contract says.  You just leave the parties where they are.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --To a moving party, and you are never the moving party.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's granting nobody relief.  We're leaving you where you are.  ""Get out of here"" is what we're saying.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't know what the answer is, so go away; we leave you where you are.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  That assumes that the contracting officer's termination for default was valid.  And we don't know that it was valid, and we don't want to have to inquire whether it was valid.  So to say ""go away"" means everybody keeps the money he has.   Antonin Scalia  Why is that unliquidated?  I didn't get the distinction between the -- why is the 1.35 unliquidated?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the other?

Antonin Scalia  Mr. Fergenson, I suppose you could say the same thing about any United States manufacturer--   Antonin Scalia  --who would desire to sell his product in any of the States that would buy it?   Antonin Scalia  And to say that this foreign manufacturer is therefore suable in any State would mean that any American manufacturer is suable in any State?

Antonin Scalia  That's true when there is a proper jurisdictional basis, which is what we're talking about here: What does the United States mean when it says there is a proper jurisdictional basis?

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. -- Mr. Boies, you talked about loss causation.  The Respondents assert that that's not what the Fifth Circuit was really doing, that -- that really they're just trying to rebut the presumption essentially of -- of Basic by -- by showing that at the -- at the far end, there was -- there was nothing that could justify the presumption.  Would you be satisfied if we just said that we agree with you that the requirement to prove loss causation is -- is no good, and sent it back to the Fifth Circuit and then let the Fifth Circuit adopt the theory that Respondents assert they have already adopted?  I mean, it's sort of a Pyrrhic victory, it seems to me, if you haven't just disapproved loss causation.   Antonin Scalia  Well, they -- they would construe it the way Respondents say they have already construed it.   Antonin Scalia  I think what you've said is that there's really no difference between loss causation and what Respondents assert that the Fifth Circuit found.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Okay, but -- but you -- you would want us to say that and not just say that loss causation--   Antonin Scalia  But you acknowledged that if the cause was the fact that the market was not efficient, that could be raised at the certification stage.   Antonin Scalia  Can you -- can you do this in reverse?  I mean, suppose the class comes in and, instead of proving at the outset that the market's an efficient market and allege a misrepresentation, they come in at the back end and they say: When that statement that we assert was a misrepresentation was corrected, the price of stock went down and we lost money.  Now, it seems to me you would have to argue, well, that's a good allegation if it's an efficient market, which is a common question, right?   Antonin Scalia  So they can certify under Rule 23 by using the back end.  Instead of proving the efficient market, they can prove that there was a statement correcting the alleged misrepresentation, the price of stock went down, right, and they can certify the class?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why not?  It would be -- it would be a common question whether the market's efficient or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They're not relying on that assumption.  They -- they come in and show that there was a correction of what we alleged was a misstatement and the market went down.  That's all that they allege.  And of course, that proves anything only if there's an efficient market.  But that will be a common question to the whole class, so we'll, we'll -- we'll save that for later.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but they assert that.  They assert that the reason it went down was because of the initial misstatement.   Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  I'm just saying that seems to me it's a crazy way to run a railroad.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you can allege what's upfront, you can allege what's -- what's in the back, and what's upfront becomes a common question, so you certify the whole class.   ",09-1403

Rule 23 only requires that -- that there be a common question.   Antonin Scalia  I thought that the whole reason you -- you say that the class certification stage is so significant is precisely because once the class is certified, there will be immense discovery on the merits of the case, which will be so expensive for defendants that they're inclined to throw in the towel.

He knows that -- that he drove, what -- how far away was it?  Six blocks or -- a good distance from where the shooter was.  He knows all of that.  The only reason he could be giving the name of the person who shot him is so that person could be apprehended and punished.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  One way to evaluate those statements is what they are made in response to.  If they are made in response to a certain type of police inquiry, they are more likely to be testimonial.  And another kind -- you know, are you dying?  They are more likely not to be testimonial.  But it is ultimately the statements that -- that we have to evaluate, whether they are testimonial or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, if it was an emergency, he wouldn't have asked, ""What happened""?  He would ask, ""What is happening""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  To ask what happened is to ask the declarant to describe past events, which is testimonial.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you were worried about that, do you run immediately over to the person lying on the ground or do you examine the gas station first, rather than expose yourself to the -- to the shooter that you think is still in the gas station?  The -- the behavior of the police here gave no indication that they thought they were in danger immediately, and -- and were interrogating this person in order to assess the danger to them.  That wasn't what they were after.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So at least whenever the police come upon somebody who has been the victim of a violent crime, whatever interrogation they conduct could plausibly be to -- to make sure that the person is not still nearby, and that testimony will always be admissible?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no, no.  It's not designed to assess the risk.  You don't know what they are designed to do.  These policemen didn't say: We are assessing the risk.  They just asked the questions.  And that's what is going to happen in future cases.  And you are saying, whenever policemen come upon a victim of violent crime and said: Who did it?  What's his name?  All of that will always be admissible, because they -- they could be assessing the risk, right?   Antonin Scalia  Only when he's excited, right?  Only when the victim who has been the object of a violent crime is excited.  Or if State law doesn't apply and we are dealing with a Federal crime and Federal officers, right, and trial in Federal court?  And in that case, what Justice Breyer just said would not apply.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you distinguish between collecting evidence for a future prosecution and collecting evidence in order to pursue and arrest the felon?  Do you distinguish those two?  And you can say these police -- these policemen weren't collecting evidence for a future prosecution; they just wanted to know who the shooter was and where he was so they could go get him.  Would that -- would that not be collecting evidence for a future prosecution?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you say it has to be for the purpose of a future prosecution.  Just -- just in order to an arrest and bring into jail the person who committed this crime, that doesn't qualify?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When does that not exist in the case of a violent crime?  When does that not exist?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There is a violent criminal out there.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So if you use a gun, a knife, or a machinegun, whatever the victim says gets admitted into evidence, because the police could -- could be not -- not trying to get evidence, but just trying to safeguard society against the -- the felon on the loose?   Antonin Scalia  I thought that's how you just described it.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Who did it.   Antonin Scalia  That's always the case.  That's such a phony evasion of what the purpose of a testimonial rule is.  That's always going to be the case, at least when there is a violent crime.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you may as well take Crawford and throw it out, in -- in the majority of serious cases, if that's going to be your rule.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The crime was ongoing in -- in Davis when -- when the woman was on the phone with the operator.  It was ongoing.  She was seeking help from the emergency that was occurring to her at that moment.  There is nothing like that here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Will they ever know that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, is that -- is that likely not always to be the case when -- when you come upon a person who has been the -- they victim of a violent crime?  You can say it all the time.  No, they didn't know where the -- where the offender was, so whatever this person says comes in as evidence in a trial.   INTERRUPTING ",09-150X
1,"Antonin Scalia  I think your answer, counsel, is that we decided that in Crawford from which Justice Breyer dissented.   Antonin Scalia  That's what we said in Crawford, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Van Hoek, what is the basis for your concession that a dying declaration is an exception from the Confrontation Clause?  It is an exception from hearsay, for certain, but from the Confrontation Clause?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You conceded it.  It's been the whole basis for Justice Ginsburg's subsequent interrogation.   Antonin Scalia  I -- I thought it was an open question only -- only where the -- the defendant has effected the death of the person who has made the dying declaration.  I don't know of any cases that allow a dying declaration in over a Confrontation Clause objection.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it hasn't been reached and if it is not an established exception to the Confrontation Clause, there is no basis for saying, therefore, the Confrontation Clause pertains only to reliability.  It pertains to the opportunity to cross-examine.  And -- and reliability exceptions are what we used to do under -- under Reynolds.  If it was reliable, we let it in.  The mere fact that it is reliable as a dying declaration instead of reliable as to something else ought to have nothing to do with the Confrontation Clause decision.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The guy in the gas station is present.  It's not past.  He is making an assertion the guy who is now in the gas station shot me.  The shot me is past, but he is asserting that the person is now in the gas station.  That is a statement of a present fact.   Antonin Scalia  Do it.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I guess it depends on what you mean, by in the past, as Justice Breyer put it.  Undoubtedly under the regime of United States v. Reynolds which was what, 25 years old -- when--   Antonin Scalia  --Roberts, I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  Roberts.  Reynolds was the Mormon case -- which was about 25 years old or so when Crawford was decided, yes, hearsay was your protection, and that was it.  But if by -- what you had mean is in the past, Crawford examined the past and its conclusion as to what the past said is quite different from what Justice Breyer now says, although he joined Crawford.   Antonin Scalia  Well, they can always do it.  You -- you don't say they can't do it.   Antonin Scalia  They can always ask the questions.  The only issue here is not whether they can ask the questions, but whether after they ask them the answers can be introduced at trial.   Antonin Scalia  Would they ask his name?  God, it's really important for us to know, four students on the ground.  What's the name of the guy that did this?  That's not the emergency.  They would say where is he.   ",09-150X

Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Frederick, I have this problem with -- with your interpretation.  As -- as has been said, the government interprets ""unavoidable"" to mean unavoidable with respect to the vaccine that has been approved.  If it doesn't mean that, if it simply means unavoidable with some other vaccine, you could always avoid them if you have a vaccine that is significantly less effective.  I mean, what other vaccine are you comparing it with?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that, but the plaintiff comes in and says, Look, you could have eliminated this, this, and this, and these side effects would not occur.  Of course the vaccine would only be effective in 75 % of the cases, but nonetheless, it was avoidable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that doesn't answer my question.  I acknowledge it rests on current scientific knowledge, but current scientific knowledge would enable you to design a drug that does not have these side effects even though it's significantly less effective, and there is no criterion as to how much less effective it has to be to qualify and so forth, whereas the government's interpretation of the word ties it to a -- to a particular vaccine.

The later judgment is -- is not just a later judgment with respect to the same act.  It's a later judgment with -- with respect to a different act.

Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So that's your only point, not that it's going to be very difficult for employers to figure out who can be protected and who can't?  You abandon that issue?

Antonin Scalia  You don't even have to agree with his description of what Sanders Brothers and the APA say.   Antonin Scalia  Isn't there a doctrine of the scope of persons protected under a particular statute?   Antonin Scalia  Doesn't the word ""person aggrieved"" bring that whole lore along with it?   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure it's broader.  Why do you say it's broader?  It says  ""adversely affected or aggrieved within the meaning of the relevant statute. ""  and it's that language that says, well, the statute was only meant to protect this group of people, and the fact that somebody else was incidentally harmed would not be covered.  I don't know why you say that's broader.  If anything, it's narrower than what we have here.  We just say ""aggrieved"".  It doesn't say within the meaning of a relevant statute.

Antonin Scalia  What if, in fact, there isn't -- what if both Counsel say, no, you should not declare a mistrial?  Can the judge go ahead and declare a mistrial?   Antonin Scalia  That's not a very big fact.   Antonin Scalia  Was there an objection here by counsel for the defendant?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. McGormley, is it your burden to answer that question?  Given AEDPA, is it up to you to show that this case is within the mainstream or is it up to the other side to show rather conclusively that it is not in the mainstream?  I thought that's what AEDPA required.   Antonin Scalia  It is Petitioner's burden to show that there are cases like this, where I guess to show that uniformly in cases like this, there is no discharge of the jury.  And I'm not aware that they have carried that burden.  But we will ask when they come up.  It is their burden, however.   Antonin Scalia  But again, that's -- that's not your burden.  We are operating here under a statute which says:  ""In a proceeding instituted by an application for a writ of habeas corpus by a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a State court, a determination of a factual issue made by a State court shall be presumed to be correct. ""  ""The applicant shall have the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing evidence. ""  Now, what is the factual determination that has been made here?  I assume it's the factual determination that the jury was deadlocked.   Antonin Scalia  And that has to be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence, correct?   Antonin Scalia  Why didn't you answer that to those questions.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. McGormley, what evidence was there to the effect that the jury was not deadlocked?   Antonin Scalia  Which is presumably what the other side has to prove by clear and convincing evidence, if -- if we accept the factual finding of the State court.   ",09-338X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Ms. -- Ms. McCowan, you are -- you are arguing the case as -- as though the -- the only question for us is whether it was an abuse of discretion by the district judge -- by the trial judge here.  That would certainly be the case if this is coming up through the Federal system and we had a Federal trial judge who had made this determination, but it is not.  It -- it is coming up from a State court and Congress enacted a statute designed specifically to reduce the interference of Federal courts with -- with State justice.  And that statute says specifically that where there has been a factual finding by the State court, it cannot be contradicted by -- by the Federal courts unless it is refuted by clear and convincing evidence.  Now, what clear and convincing evidence is there here that there was not a deadlocked jury?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, what was the basis for that declaration of mistrial?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Michigan Supreme Court's determination is simply a determination of the same fact: There was a manifest necessity because the jury was deadlocked.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, that factfinding is implicit not -- not only in what the trial court did, but also in the Michigan Supreme Court's decision.   Antonin Scalia  But our -- but our cases have required much -- much more than that, much more than referring to a generalized standard that our opinions have set forth.  They have required proving that the application of that standard in our opinions comports with the provision of the statute that requires you to show that the claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to or involved in unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  Now, our cases don't show that you can simply come in and say, well, it's an abuse of discretion standard, that was clearly established by the Supreme Court of the United States, and therefore all I have to show is that this is an abuse of discretion.  I don't think so.  I think our cases show you have to show that the standard as applied by our cases does not cover your situation.  And you don't have any cases like that.   Antonin Scalia  That may be.  That may well be--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which says it's a terrible statute, but there it is.  It says it has to be contrary to clearly established Federal law as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.  And you are saying, no, it's enough if it's established by an unbroken line of lower court decisions.  That's not what the statute says.   Antonin Scalia  Well, maybe that's right and maybe it's wrong, but the State courts thought that it was evidence of acrimony, which it could be.  And you say: Well, it also couldn't be.  That may well be.  But we are bound to accept the factual determination of the State court, unless you can show by clear and convincing evidence that that's wrong.   Antonin Scalia  Don't waste your time.  I will look for it.   Antonin Scalia  Don't waste your argument time.  I will look for it.   Antonin Scalia  So the standard of review for setting aside a determination of the State Supreme Court is exactly the same as the standard of review for reviewing a Federal district court and a Federal court of appeals despite AEDPA?  We simply look and see whether there has been an abuse of discretion.  If there has, we set aside the State Supreme Court judgment?   Antonin Scalia  But it's objectively unreasonable, you say, whenever there has been an abuse of discretion by the -- by the trial court, right?   Antonin Scalia  So it's not just abuse of discretion; it's abuse of discretion plus something else?  Plus what?   Antonin Scalia  But ""objectively unreasonable"" is already built into the criterion of abuse of discretion.  You don't abuse your discretion if what you have done is reasonable, you know, within the ballpark.  It seems to me you are doubling up here.  I -- I don't -- I don't understand how it works.   Antonin Scalia  Do you always have to poll the jury, is that what you are saying is a requirement?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I am not aware that you would always have to poll the jury, and I could see some real disadvantages to it as a matter of fact.  It perhaps puts more pressure on those who are the -- the holdouts, it identifies, in some cases, whose are the holdouts.  I'm not aware that that's a requirement.   INTERRUPTING ",09-338X

What does that do?  Does that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I mean, doesn't that necessarily mean that there are indeed two final judgments?

It happens all the time.  The judge makes a mistake; society pays for it.   Antonin Scalia  Now, what -- what can the defendant do within that 90 days?  He has to wait 90 days before he appeals the sentence that he has been given; is that right?   Antonin Scalia  That's 3 months that--  that he has to sit on his hands.   Antonin Scalia  Must take it into account--   Antonin Scalia  --if you read 3553 the way it's written.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- I have a question going just to that.  It seems to me that if 3553, as -- as I said -- maybe you shouldn't have agreed -- requires the sentencing court to consider the totality of the sentence it's imposing, including the restitution, that would mean that the judge cannot impose a sentence before the expiration of the 90 days; that is, has to wait until the restitutionary issue is resolved to impose the incarceration part of the sentence.  No?   Antonin Scalia  Before you do that, tell me what the government appeal would consist of.  The 90 days has expired--   Antonin Scalia  --And you -- you tell me the court -- the court has no ability to impose restitution after 90 days.

I think it's bad enough to have the issue of whether this victim suffered $100,000 damages decided by the judge, if that's what you're going to be sentenced to, but at least it's being decided by the judge who tried the case.  And under your proposal, it can be decided by some other judge who is just -- just pulled in, because the -- the trial judge has -- has been deceased.  That doesn't seem to me to make any sense at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't the statute establish time limits for filing an appeal?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Same thing here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let me see if I understand this.  He has 14 days to appeal that.  And if he doesn't do that, then later within the 90 days or even after the 90 days, a sentence of restitution is imposed, he can -- he can appeal that sentence of restitution, right?   Antonin Scalia  On the same grounds on which he would have appealed the -- the sentence of imprisonment, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If -- if it's an error in the trial, he claims: I was innocent.   Antonin Scalia  No?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What was that statute on imprisonment?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I've got it.   Antonin Scalia  Even though there's no amount given?   Antonin Scalia  Simply because when you state an amount, that amount can be amended later, that leads to the conclusion that you need not even state an amount?

Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't think anybody thought that Buck would have fired him just for that one absence.  That was the trigger.  But it was the trigger that followed a long series of prior absences for which he had been disciplined before.  I don't see any inconsistency between those two versions.   ",09-400X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Page 3 of the blue brief.   Antonin Scalia  I think that you've misread -- I think that you've misread the ""cat's paw"" principle of the court of appeals.  I don't think that it is, to them, a determination of proximate cause at all.  As I understand their opinion, they say that the statute requires that the -- let me get the right language here -- that the discriminatory, prohibited discriminatory factor, must have been a motivating factor in the employer's action.  And they say that means it must have motivated the person who took the employer's action.  It's not a motivating factor in the employer's action unless the person who took the action on behalf of the employer had that as its motive.  Then the court of appeals makes an exception: However, if the person who appears to be taking the action on behalf of the employer is really not the person who took the action, but was totally under the control of a subordinate who -- and the person just swallowed that subordinate's determination, then we will hold, even though the ultimate firing -- the person who signed the pink slip, even though that person didn't have the motive -- if in fact the decision was effectively the decision of a lower subordinate, we will hold the employer.  It has nothing to do with proximate cause.  It has to do with the text that it has to be a motivating factor in the employer's action; not a motivating factor somewhere down the line, but in the employer's action.  That's how I read the court of appeals opinion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not the point.  It seems to me you have to establish -- we are not going to second-guess the jury determination here.  I understood your point to be that there's a difference between a motivating factor in the decision, which means the person who made the decision on behalf of the employer must have had that motive, and on the other hand, a factor which was relevant to the decision, or a factor which influenced the decision.  That's quite different from a motivating factor in the decision.  You have to get us to believe -- and I'm not sure we will -- that motivating factor in the decision refers to motive on the part of the person who made the decision.  That's essentially your point, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  How does the Secretary of Labor administer this statute?  What are -- what are his or her responsibilities under the statute?   Antonin Scalia  Can I turn to the Secretary of Labor's regulations?  Are what we talking about anything more than the following statement in his commentary accompanying the final regs, namely that an employee, quote,  ""need not show that his or her protected activities or status was the sole cause of the employment action. ""  ""The person's activities or status need be only one of the factors that a truthful employer would list if asked for the reasons for its decision. ""  Is that -- is that the only--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --This is the one that the government refers to.   Antonin Scalia  That doesn't seem to me to be so damning of your case.  I think if this employer had been asked the reasons for its decision it would have given Ms. Buck's reasons.   ",09-400X
1,"Antonin Scalia  It was the same in Hanrahan.  There was a right to a certain process in the lower court, and the -- the person complaining achieved reversal.  It was sent back and said: Do it right.  Give this person the process that -- that he's entitled to.   Antonin Scalia  As the Respondent points out, the position you're taking is unusual for the government.  The government is usually arguing against fees, because the fees are often assessed against the government.   Antonin Scalia  So long as you know that you're making your bed and you're going to have to lie in it--  [Laughter]  --and you're essentially saying that when there is simply a procedural victory, which happens all the time, when -- when an agency is -- is reversed in its procedure even though the -- the -- the petitioner here doesn't get any concrete relief until it goes back to the agency and may lose in the agency ultimately, you're -- you're content to say that fees are assessable in that situation, just by reason of the procedural victory.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I'm talking about other prevailing -- I'm talking about other statutes that don't say ""prevailing party"".   Antonin Scalia  Sure.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm -- I'm -- I'm not sure it's reasonable to interpret an attorney's fee provision as having anything to do with trust law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's -- it's a requirement of attorney's fees enacted by -- by the Federal Congress, and I -- I find that very artificial.   ",09-448X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Future claimants will not ask for summary judgment from the district court, presumably, in light of Conkright.  They will ask that the case be remanded.  So, in future cases, will they have obtained a victory?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, we've -- we've already told them they can't get that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The claimant doesn't -- doesn't really claim that.  The claimant just says this was a wrong decision and they should do it correctly.  And the claimant knows that all he's going to get from the district court is a remand.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So he would not ask for money and, therefore, would be victorious, on your analysis.  If all he asked for was a remand, he got a remand.

Which one of them was -- was within, what, 5 miles of any -- any field of the genetically engineered alfalfa?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What?  From what?  From--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --From somebody within 5 miles, 10 miles, 20 miles?   Antonin Scalia  So you want the Court to assume that somebody is going to be planting a field of the genetically engineered alfalfa within, what, 5 miles of--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --one of your named plaintiffs?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The fact is there isn't a single named plaintiff who -- who has -- has any claim that within the utmost limits of -- of risk, he is at risk currently.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  But you have to bring in a member from that organization--   Antonin Scalia  --who is concretely harmed.   Antonin Scalia  You -- you don't think the free market would produce companies that advertise: We only cut natural seed fields?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't think that would happen?  I am sure it would happen.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I am really losing you now.  I thought he was referring to the number of farmers who would be planting and harvesting genetically engineered alfalfa.  Isn't that -- farmers who wanted to do it.  He was saying: We now have 200,000; we are going to have a million.   Antonin Scalia  All right.  Acreage, whatever.  He's talking about acreage of farmers who plant and want to plant--   Antonin Scalia  --genetically engineered seed.   Antonin Scalia  He's not talking about how many unwilling farmers are going to have infected fields.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I'm not sure we understood.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me pretty doggone imminent if the agency has come before the court and said: This kind of partial deregulation ought to be allowed, and we're in favor of it.  I mean, you are not sending it back to an agency that's a blank slate.  You know that the agency favors this degree of deregulation.   Antonin Scalia  I mean -- I'd -- you know, I -- boy, I'd take a remand to the agency any day.   Antonin Scalia  This isn't contamination of the New York City water supply.  It's the creation of plants of -- of genetically engineered alfalfa which spring up that otherwise wouldn't exist.  It doesn't even destroy the current plantings of non-genetically engineered alfalfa.  This is not the end of the world.  It really isn't.  The most it does is make it difficult for those farmers who want to cater to the European market, which will not accept genetically engineered alfalfa.  It makes it more difficult for them to have a field of 100 percent non-genetically engineered.  But that's not the end of the world, Mr. Robbins.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought you were comparing it to New York City dying--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --from poisoned water?

[Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What happened with it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We -- we don't necessarily have to do that.  We just have to decide whether the lower courts did it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, if we concluded that they didn't do it, that would -- that would be enough, wouldn't it?  We wouldn't have to do it ourselves.

0,"Antonin Scalia  And I suppose the prosecution can alter the consequence based on what it chooses to bring in a single prosecution.  I mean, if it has a -- other enhancements, it should bring a separate prosecution for that.  So long as it brings it in one suit, you say, in one prosecution, you get the break.  But if -- if the other enhancement is brought -- has been brought in a separate prosecution, you don't get it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.  Yes, I understand what you are saying.   Antonin Scalia  So let's suppose somebody commits a rape and a maiming in the same criminal act.  You are saying that the prosecution -- and let's assume it's his third.  It's his third violent crime.  So he would get the enhancement as being, you know, a three-time violent crime loser.  You are saying he could get that enhancement and the enhancement under this -- under this gun -- he had a gun at the same time.  He can get it if the prosecution charges rape in one prosecution, for which he will get the three-time loser enhancement, and then in a separate prosecution, it charges maiming and the use of a firearm.  Then he gets both enhancements, right?   Antonin Scalia  That seems--   Antonin Scalia  --He's disagreeing with you.  He -- your theory -- you are not reading a crime to mean an affair in the world.  You are reading it to mean a particular prosecution for a particular violation of a statute.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, read it that way.  If he wants to read it as an affair in the world, what--   Antonin Scalia  --There has never been any incentive to do so, until we accept your interpretation.  Then there will be means to do so.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me, before you go on.  Your last remark, it has to be a previous conviction.  So why doesn't that leave it in the hands of the prosecutor whether to bring that conviction, that other case, prior or subsequent?   ",09-479X

Antonin Scalia  So, you know, I think what the Chief Justice says is very obvious when you are just talking about C(1)(a), but it isn't obvious to me that if -- if the firearm is discharged and in addition it's a machine gun or destructive device, that you'd only get the 30 rather than the 30 plus 10.   Antonin Scalia  That isn't obvious to me.  And the ""except"" clause would -- would handle that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where is 930(c)?

1,"Antonin Scalia  I guess you could argue that on its face the agreement is so one-sided, so unconscionable, that one of the parties must have been coerced into signing it.  I guess you could make that argument, can't -- couldn't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Has -- has that argument been made here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was the argument made that because it was so unconscionable, the employee must have been coerced into making it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I didn't think it -- it had been made.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't agree with that.  I mean, if -- if the argument is made -- I gather it wasn't made here, but if the argument is made that this agreement was not voluntary, and the evidence of that involuntariness is how outrageously unfair it is -- now, I'm not sure that that's enough evidence.  You may need some other stuff as well to -- to persuade a court.  But if that is the argument, that the one-sidedness is evidence that the agreement was not voluntary, I don't see how that's for the arbitrator.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't think that could be used along with other evidence?  I think all you're saying is that it is not in and of itself enough, that every unfair agreement is not a coerced agreement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you could use it as evidence if there's other evidence supporting that.  Couldn't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think you can answer that yes or no.  Can you use that in addition to other evidence to show that the agreement was not voluntary?   Antonin Scalia  Do you agree that a contract cannot be unconscionable unless it was coerced, that a finding of unconscionability is the same as a finding of coercion?  You don't agree with that, do you?   Antonin Scalia  Can you--   Antonin Scalia  --Once again, has this argument been made here?  I thought that the only basis was unconscionability.  I suppose you could have made the argument that the contract is void because one of its essential provisions has been rendered unlawful and, therefore -- and is not severable, and, therefore, the whole contract fails.  I suppose you could make that argument.  That hasn't been made, has it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can they make it here now?  Can they make -- I mean, even if they had -- you know, even if there was no reason to make it in the district court, is the law--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that since they didn't have an opportunity to make it in the district court, they can make it in the Supreme Court?   ",09-497X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Is that -- is that right?  Is the arbitrator free to decide unconscionability in a vacuum without taking into account State law at all?  And doesn't he get reviewed afterwards by the State court on the basis of a much more lenient standard than -- than if the court decided it de novo.  But can he really disregard State law regarding unconscionability?   Antonin Scalia  No -- I mean, you -- I thought you were saying that if we allow this to go to the arbitrator, the arbitrator can simply disregard the question of unconscionability.   Antonin Scalia  And that's not my understanding.  My understanding is that he's -- he is obliged to take account of State law regarding unconscionability, but it's going to be his call, as it would be the district judge's call if this had gone to court, whether in fact this is unconscionable.  Afterwards, there will be court review.  And if he has totally disregarded all State law regarding unconscionability, wouldn't -- wouldn't you have a basis to set aside the -- the arbitration?   Antonin Scalia  That doesn't mean -- does that mean he can disregard -- let's assume the contract is a contract to maim.  I mean, it -- you know, it's -- it's like -- it's a Shylock contract, okay?  He's going to be able to exact a pound of flesh.  Now, there are State laws which invalidate contracts to maim.  Do you think that the arbitrator can ignore that, and say, well, you know, I don't really think it's so bad; a pound of flesh sounds reasonable to me?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can he ignore the State law?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that right?  You don't think a State court would in the blink of an eye set aside an arbitration that allowed a -- a pound of flesh?   Antonin Scalia  I think you have a misunderstanding of the law, then, if that's what you believe.  I -- I think there's no doubt what would happen in that case.   Antonin Scalia  You wrote that, didn't you?  Didn't you write that opinion?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Let's assume Nevada law says you cannot -- you cannot fire somebody for coming in late to work any fewer than 10 times, all right?  And an individual is fired.  He goes to arbitration, or at least the company tries to take him to arbitration on it.  And he says, no, because I was fired in violation of Nevada law.  Now, is it your position that that -- that that case would have to go immediately to court and could not submit to the arbitrator the issue of whether indeed he was fired for coming less than 10 times, and indeed whether if he was coming in less than 10 times, that would be an invalid basis for a dismissal?   Antonin Scalia  Well, your -- your position seems to be that unconscionability is the same as coercion in the making of the agreement.  And I don't know that that's true.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I don't care what we--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I don't care what we said in dictum.  It doesn't seem to me that unconscionability is the same as duress or the same as fraud--   Antonin Scalia  --that you can -- you can be a stupid person who voluntarily signs an unconscionable contract.  Now, the courts may protect you because you're stupid, but you haven't been coerced.  Is there no distinction between unconscionability and coercion?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why is that?   Antonin Scalia  Why is that?  I would say all unconscionability challenges, if you have an agreement that's as clear as this one, would go to the arbitrator.  Which ones would have to go to the court?   Antonin Scalia  Not much use signing an arbitration agreement then, not much use for the employer.  He's going to end up in court anyway.  Every one of them will be acknowledge as unconscionable.  So what's the use?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, kiss good-bye to arbitration.   Antonin Scalia  No?

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Phillips, this is what troubles me about -- about your position: You make a viscerally appealing case on the facts of this case, where you say that your clients, the railroads, are being taxed more than competing carriers, truckers and -- and water carriers.  But if all -- if all it says is 85 and doesn't make the same exemption for railroads, the railroads win, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?  How do you limit the term ""discrimination""?  Just a discrimination in favor of other competing carriers?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why -- why do you assume that?  Congress didn't limit it to that in -- in the property tax exemption.

The railroads were to be given, you know, the most favored treatment of -- of all the industrial and -- and commercial entities, I -- I think.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I agree with that, and that makes me suspect that Congress didn't -- didn't want to forbid exemptions in (b)(4).   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't make any -- any sense, you are quite right; but -- but Congress thought it made sense in (1) to (3), so why doesn't it make sense in (4)?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's the argument.   Antonin Scalia  Use a lot of conjunctions.

I don't see where solving your predictability problem, you're worried about it, you know, we don't know how to tax anymore.  I don't know why it's any more certain if we -- if we say the key is whether it's a generally applicable tax than it is if we say the key is whether it discriminates against railroads.  I mean it's the same inquiry.  So what do you care?  It's just as -- just as unpredictable ex ante.  It's exactly the same inquiry, whether it's generally applicable or whether it discriminates against railroads.  Isn't -- isn't -- isn't that what you have been saying?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, it's twiddle dum or twiddle dee, maybe we should, you know, dismiss this as improvidently granted, it doesn't make any difference.

Antonin Scalia  That's not what -- it depends on the context of ""make"".  If you're talking about making heaven and earth, yes, that means to create, but if you're talking about making a representation, that means presenting the representation to someone, not -- not drafting it for someone else to make.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But if JCM falsely represented what it would do, it made that false representation to the Fund, and the Fund, as has been acknowledged, would have a cause of action against JCM.

The representation was made in the prospectus issued by the Fund, not by JCM.  Now, the Fund may have a cause of action against JCM, but what's crucial here is whether -- whether you can establish that it is JCM who made the representation to the public, and I don't see how you can get there.  You might proceed under the control provision, but not by saying that they made the representation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's fine.  Just like writing a speech for somebody.

Didn't it have outside lawyers who advised it whether it should allow this statement to be included in its prospectus?  How can you say that they -- they didn't have control?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that may mean that they're duped, but it doesn't mean that they don't have control.  They had control, but you say they -- they were duped, but that's quite a different theory from saying that they had control -- that they didn't have control.

Antonin Scalia  Okay.

Why is it somehow a -- a greater infringement upon a State sovereignty to allow a State to be sued in Federal court by a private individual, who doesn't even have to be a Virginian, for Pete's sake, he could be from anywhere, he could be from Iowa.  And yet it somehow offends State sovereignty more when -- when you allow a State agency to sue a State?  I don't -- I don't see why that is so horribly worse, unless you are arguing that -- that it somehow destroys the State system of separation of powers.  But that's a different question and -- and the answer to that is simply, you did it yourself.   Antonin Scalia  And -- and that has independent litigating authority.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  I mean, that's the difference here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This agency was given independent litigating authority.   Antonin Scalia  Your argument is really -- really is a sovereign immunity argument.  You are saying that the waiver of sovereign immunity, unless it explicitly includes a waiver to be sued in Federal courts, applies only in State courts -- okay -- and that that limitation should not be evaded by applying Ex parte Young to a suit in Federal court where the suit is by another State agency.   Antonin Scalia  So sovereign immunity is part of your argument, but--   ",09-529X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Now, that can't be a Ninth Circuit rule.  I mean, that has to depend upon each -- each of the States in the Ninth Circuit, no?  I mean, some State could -- could have a different ruling, I assume.  You're -- you're telling us, however, that California has that rule?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do -- does the court sometimes deny explicitly on procedural grounds?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you are saying that if it's on both grounds, if they agreed with both the procedural and the merits ground, they may well just -- just deny without any explanation?  But if they deny only on the procedural ground, they will -- they will say it?   Antonin Scalia  All right.   Antonin Scalia  I thought you just told me that if they -- if they agreed both on the procedural ground and the merits ground, they could issue just -- just a denial without explanation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now you are telling me that -- the opposite.   Antonin Scalia  It will always be in the order.   Antonin Scalia  Why -- do you think it makes a difference whether the expert would have helped or not?  I mean, counsel has to make that decision of whether to call an expert ex ante, not ex post.  I mean, you -- we shouldn't evaluate his decision on the basis of whether, even if it's a 1,000-to-1 long shot, it turns out that that testimony would have been very successful.  Don't we have to examine it ex ante before he knows what the result will be?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical would include the situation where he doesn't know that the prosecution is going to introduce any expert testimony.  He knows that there is blood there.  He should -- he should get his own expert, whether or not the prosecution uses one.  Right?  I mean, can it never be ineffective assistance not to call an expert where -- so long as the prosecution doesn't have one on the other side?   Antonin Scalia  Well, could?  Really?  Is that your test?  It could, there is some remote possibility?   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me, you lost me.

Antonin Scalia  We've never adopted the ABA standards, have we?   Antonin Scalia  That standard seems to me quite silly.

There is no majority for either ground and yet you find in favor of the State?  How can that be?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but you are positing that the only time they do not say either procedurally barred or on the merits is when they don't have a majority for either one?

I -- I didn't read the opinion as ever saying that he would have gone to trial.  The opinion says he could have gotten a better deal.  That's quite a different -- quite a different question, and I -- I'm not prepared to make that the test.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's not the test that -- that Hill prescribed.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Wax, as far as the confession is concerned and its excludability, what effect do you think we ought to give to this passage in the -- in the defendant's agreement to the plea:  ""I understand that any admissions, statements, or confessions which I may have made or any evidence obtained by virtue of the search and seizure of my property may well be inadmissible against me in evidence, unless my constitutional rights have been safeguarded. ""  ""I understand that if I would like to speak to an attorney concerning my constitutional rights, that the Court will grant me time for that purpose. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  Wait.  This is not the attorney speaking.  I mean, this is what he said.  He said,  ""I understand that any admissions, statements or confessions which I have made may well be -- may well be inadmissible against me in evidence.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Are we just talking about a funeral?  That's one of the problems I have with the case.  There was also this video that your client watched, right, later, after the funeral.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  Well, what does that have to do with the funeral?   Antonin Scalia  That's fine, but it -- it does not intrude upon the funeral.  I mean, no.  You either have two separate causes of action -- one is the intrusion upon the funeral and the other is the harm caused by viewing this posting on the Internet -- but I don't see how they both relate to intrusion upon the funeral.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And they were just submitted to the jury as one big lump, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose there hadn't been a funeral protest, just the epic.  Would that have supported the cause of action you assert here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes or no?   Antonin Scalia  Even though it's -- he doesn't have to watch them?  They are just posted on the Internet.   Antonin Scalia  It's his choice to watch them, but if he chooses to watch them he has a cause of action because it causes him distress.   Antonin Scalia  That statute applies to any protest at funerals: Protesting the Vietnam War, protesting whatever.  Your case involves, at least if we accept your version of it, a protest of the dead soldier who -- who is going to hell and whose parents have raised him to go to hell.  So simply to say you can have a protest within a certain distance is not to say you can have a protest within a certain distance that defames the corpse.  That's a different issue, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the intrusion upon the privacy of the funeral is out of the case then, right, because that sign would intrude upon the privacy of thea funeral just as much?  That's not really what you are complaining about.  You are complaining about the personal attacks, aren't you?   Antonin Scalia  I thought that they had to come in a different entrance?  Is that the extent of the disruption?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In order to avoid the protest.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you wouldn't have objected to that if there weren't these nasty signs, you just said, right?   Antonin Scalia  All right.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Summers, I'm a little concerned at your apparent acceptance of -- of the proposition that if one comes up to a Marine and says, you are contributing to a -- a terribly unfair war, that that alone would -- would form the basis for the -- the tort of intentional infliction of an emotional distress.  What -- what are the requirements for that?  I thought that it had to be outrageous conduct.  Doesn't it have to be outrageous conduct?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean -- I mean, why accept that as -- as parallel to what -- to what you are claiming here?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Summers, can I ask you: Suppose I don't think you have a cause of action for invasion of privacy when these people were at this distance from the funeral.  But that was one of the causes of action submitted to the jury.  If I disagree with you on that cause of action, I suppose I would have to say there has to be a retrial now.   Antonin Scalia  So you have to support both causes of action here, the intentional infliction of emotional distress and the invasion of privacy, right?   Antonin Scalia  Waived what issue?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, all right.  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  I guess that that kind of a call is always necessary under -- under the tort that you're -- that you're relying upon.  The conduct has to be outrageous, right?   Antonin Scalia  That always requires that kind of a call, unless the tort is unconstitutional, as applied to all -- all harm inflicted by words.

1,"Antonin Scalia  My goodness.  We did have a doctrine of fighting words, and you acknowledge that if somebody said, you know, things such as that to his face, that wouldn't be protected by the First Amendment.   Antonin Scalia  Unprotected.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that so?  Do we know that?   Antonin Scalia  Do we know that?  Is it the criterion of the fighting words exception to the First Amendment that there be an actual fight?  Certainly not that.  Is it a requirement that there be a potential for a fight?  I doubt it.  Where -- where do you get the notion that it has -- that there has to be an imminent fight?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which say what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The person was too remote?  The fight was not -- was not imminent?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And she's a Quaker, too.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think that everybody--   Antonin Scalia  --Excuse me--   Antonin Scalia  --Let's talk about subjectively.  You're concerned about -- surely fighting words is -- you know, whether something is a fighting word, that is a very subjective call, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  You don't think it's subjective?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think that's solid, absolutely, what's a fighting word, whereas what is an outrageous statement is very much different from what's a fighting word?  I don't see the difference.  Besides which, isn't it the case that in order to recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional injury, you have to substantiate the injury with some physical manifestation, which the plaintiff here had?  And my goodness, for fighting words, you don't even need that.  You can just say, these words angered me to the degree that I would have been inclined to fight.  At least for this tort, you have to have physical manifestations.  Why isn't that a very objective standard?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well--   Antonin Scalia  --That's -- that's the problem.  I mean, you can talk about a grievance procedure.  I suppose there's always one in -- in companies that -- that are unionized, but an awful lot of companies aren't.  Your -- the -- the Respondent is -- is going to argue that this statute doesn't apply to private filings of complaints anyway, that it relates only to the filing of a complaint with the government.  And that -- that's a new -- a new point in this case, and normally I would not be disposed to consider it.  My problem is, I cannot decide on -- on the question of whether filing means filing only in writing or also includes verbal filing, without resolving that other question.  That is to say, if indeed the complaint has to be quote, ""filed"" with the government, I'm inclined to think that an oral complaint pursuant to procedures established by the agency which permit an oral complaint, even a complaint by telephone that would be okay.  But my goodness, if it applies to private employers as well including employers that have no grievance procedures, including employers who have employees who go to cocktail parties, I am -- I am very disinclined to think that it -- that it could mean an oral complaint in -- in that context.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you are filing your argument right now.  Now come on, people don't talk like that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That -- that -- that is absurd.  You are not filing an argument right now.  Nobody uses the language that way.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure that's true.  You -- you can complain orally to somebody at the Labor Department who decides that the complaint isn't serious enough to -- to warrant commencing a proceeding.  I mean, if you go in and insist, I -- you know, I want to begin a proceeding, that's -- that's something else.  But you can file a complaint orally without -- without doing that, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not if it's never instituted.  If no proceeding is ever instituted, you can hardly be accused of having caused a proceeding to be instituted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So if you make an informal complaint and it doesn't go any further, and they ask --  ""You know, do you want to -- No, I don't want to start a proceeding, but -- but this company is just, you know, it's acting improperly, you guys ought to look into that. ""  That's -- I'm 00 I'm prepared to say that's filing a complaint, if you are only talking about filing complaint with the government.  But if you are talking about oral filings of the complaints with employer, I am very troubled.   Antonin Scalia  This is one of the oldest, though, isn't it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is it the very oldest?  It may well be the very oldest.  You are talking about a really old fogey Congress that -- that passed this thing.   Antonin Scalia  What -- what is the language in those statutes?  All those statutes use the language ""file a complaint""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I don't understand how those agencies have any part in the administration of private lawsuits under this statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It administers lawsuits?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it seems to me it's a matter for the courts.  An agency interprets the statutes that direct the agency's own actions if it has to enforce things and so forth.  But where there is a provision for a suit in court, it seems to me it's up to the courts to decide what it means.   Antonin Scalia  What do you mean by the very same language?  Just--   Antonin Scalia  --And the remainder of it?  Institute a proceeding--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Be a member of a committee?

And so in a way we are resolving a very strange question, that is if as is not clear, you have a right to sue in the district courts for an injunction, can that suit proceed because of 1500 when there is a suit pending in the Court of Claims and that is sort of an abstract question.   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that unrealistic?  You don't want an accounting for the sake of having an accounting so that you can put the accounting in your desk.  Oh, look it, they stole $1,000,000,000 from us.  You want to get the $1,000,000,000.  If the suits are directed at the same object, and it is fanciful to think there is this separate suit for an accounting.  The object of that suit is the same thing as the object of the suit in the Court of Claims.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Were those accountings available before the Administrative Procedure Act was passed?  Is the jurisdictional basis for that the waiver of sovereign immunity that allows you to demand an accounting from the United States?  Is that just the APA?   Antonin Scalia  So you didn't have a right to that before the APA was passed?   Antonin Scalia  Either in the district court nor in the Court of Claims.  So this is not an unthinkable situation, is it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It was thought about for a century, anyway.   Antonin Scalia  Well, why have -- you say Congress has specifically recognized it by statute.  You're referring to the APA?

You -- you had to bring them both in the court of claims, no?  You didn't still have the option of -- of still bringing two different suits, did you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You had to go to the court of claims.   Antonin Scalia  No, but if they were just making it easier, they -- they would have said, you know, you can do either one.   Antonin Scalia  If you give it that narrow meaning, however, the government says you are contradicting what was the case with regard to the cotton suits.  That, in fact, some of them were asking for funds from this -- money from this common fund, and others were seeking relief against the individuals who had taken the cotton or replanted the cotton.  Those are different claims, as you define ""claim"", anyway.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That is different from the word ""claim"".  I mean, if you are hanging the whole thing on the word ""claim"", you gave me a very plausible alternate definition of ""claim"".  But your case does not follow that.

I know you say -- you say it has to shock the conscience, but if a State wants to apply a lesser standard of unconscionability, can we strike that down?   Antonin Scalia  So how do you address Justice Scalia's -- if you are saying there is no difference between those two things, then how can a State find those terms unconscionable?  Under what theory, general theory of law, would they be--   Antonin Scalia  --That is bad, absolutely, but that's not what the State is going to do.  The State is simply going to say: We find this to be unconscionable.  And you say it's not unconscionable; it's very fair.  And the State says: Eh, we think it is unconscionable.  Are we going to tell the State of California what it has to consider unconscionable?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but some -- some elements of unconscionability can only arise in a litigation or an arbitration context, such as requiring the complaining party to litigate or arbitrate at a distant location.

Isn't it the case, or do I misunderstand it, that so long as there is one payment, you get the entire deduction?   Antonin Scalia  Even one payment of $1, you get the entire deduction.  So to argue this case as though it's a question of whether you actually expend the money that you are getting the credit for is simply -- is simply false.  You don't do that under either side's interpretation, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm trying to help you, Mr. Burke.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  What -- what happens under the tax law?  Do they make an adjustment under the tax law as well?   Antonin Scalia  A standard--   Antonin Scalia  --Right.  So that they -- what is suggested is that you look at it and apply the IRS's approach as to whether you get into the chart, but then you don't use the IRS's approach when the trustee takes you out of the chart.  Is that what you think is the law?   Antonin Scalia  What's the language we are dealing with, Mr. Burke?  Do you want to quote the language to us?  Nobody's quoted the language.  What does it say is applicable?   Antonin Scalia  Wait.  The -- the applicable amounts specified where?   Antonin Scalia  Read the text of the statute, would you, please, for me?  I couldn't even get it from your brief.  You had to refer me back to the petition.  Why isn't an appendix to your brief or printed in the beginning of your brief, instead of kicking me back to dig out your petition.   Antonin Scalia  ""Amount specified under"" the standard.   Antonin Scalia  ""Applicable amount specified"", not the ""amount specified if applicable"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand what you are saying.  He asked are they split 50-50 on the point that is before us here, yes or no.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, once again, Mr. Burke, this is -- I don't know why you don't point this out.  This is not the difference between your position and the position of the other side.  You get the deduction for the other side as well, whether or not you are making the payment.  Now, maybe it can be adjusted by the trustee, but as far as the statute is concerned, so long as you make one payment of one dollar, under their theory you are entitled to claim the deduction; isn't that right.   Antonin Scalia  So.   Antonin Scalia  Is that -- is that by reason of the Internal Revenue Service--   Antonin Scalia  --manual or is it by reason of the Bankruptcy Code itself?   Antonin Scalia  So it's in the chart--   Antonin Scalia  --that you claim -- okay.   Antonin Scalia  Is this a problem distinctive to your case?  Doesn't the other side have the same problem with ownership?  Don't they acknowledge that even if you are leasing the car you get the deduction?   Antonin Scalia  I don't see why this is distinctive to your case.  It's a problem both sides face.  And we don't avoid it by coming out against you, do we?   Antonin Scalia  Why aren't -- why isn't one of the criteria the provision that says maximum allowances for housing and utilities and transportation, known as the local standards, vary by location and unlike the national standards, the taxpayer is allowed the amount actually spent or the standard, whichever is less?  Why doesn't that apply?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, because, Your Honor, in that case it's the IRS commentary we are referring to that is on page 1A of the red brief appendix.  And that -- what that's referring to is, it says the amount actually spent or the standard.  And that's distinguishing between the amount that is actually spent or the standard, which is the standard--   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --amount in the table.  Right.  And of course, we look to what -- the text that Congress enacted in the Bankruptcy Code, and that says that the debtor's monthly expenses shall be the debtor's applicable monthly expense amounts specified under the national standards and local standards.   Antonin Scalia  It's not applicable.  It's not applicable if, in fact, you haven't spent that much.  Just as you claim it's not applicable if you have no payment at all.   Nicole A. Saharsky  I think that it would further Congress's purposes to say that you have to -- that you look to the actual costs that the debtor has.  But we just don't think the text goes that far, because it says that if the expense amounts, the category, is applicable to the debtor, that then you use the expense amounts specified under the table.  But--   Antonin Scalia  It would have to go to 1,500 a month or he, out of the goodness of his heart, would decide to pay that amount?   Antonin Scalia  Fine.

I mean, it seems to me, if you are going to read in the requirement that have to have made a lease payment, you should also read in the requirement that you are referring to now, which would mean your deduction is limited by the -- by the amount of your lease payment.

Antonin Scalia  So all they have to do as far as the government is concerned is amend their complaint to say,  ""we intend to charge higher rates than the State law allows.

Antonin Scalia  But assume there hadn't been.  Assume there hadn't been such a regulation.  Do you understand it to be the government's position that the licensed drug manufacturer is not protected from State suits, even though it has a Federal permission to give certain warnings, unless it has lobbied the FDA to change those warnings?   Antonin Scalia  I thought you said you had to tell the FDA about it.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  I didn't understand that.

Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but -- but -- no, but -- but surely you have to establish not only that the generic manufacturer requested a label change, but that a label change would have been approved.  Otherwise there's no causation.  Surely--   Antonin Scalia  --that's part of your case, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  No, but -- but their -- their preemption claim is we had to give these warnings, and you don't contest that.  They had to give the warnings that they gave, unless the FDA said that the warnings must be changed, so--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I mean, I don't see how you can hold them liable, so long as they continued to give the warnings that they had to give.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought you said that generic manufacturers don't make any requests.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, I see.   Antonin Scalia  Does a generic manufacturer have to be an expert in the field in which it manufactures?   Antonin Scalia  What does -- what does being an expert mean?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In this context, being an expert means being able to produce exactly the drug that has been approved by the FDA, right?  You don't have to be expert in anything else?

It surely has to possess the chemical expertise to produce exactly the product that the -- that the -- that has been approved by the FDA.  What other expertise is necessary?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think that'd take any expertise.  You have people who complain, I've taken -- I've taken your pill, and it -- it, you know, it's caused -- this is expertise?  That's not what I normally think of.  Whereas a drug manufacturer does, indeed, require expertise, conducting tests and knowing what changes will produce what results and so forth; right?

[Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Well, I assume that the patient's physician has the same opportunity.  Anybody could go to the FDA and say this label ought to be changed, right?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not talking about what the -- the FDCA regulation.  We're talking about what State law would allow, and State law would allow a suit against the physician because he did not take advantage of the opportunity to go to the FDA and propose a label change.

I mean, no matter how soon, if he does it a week after, doesn't California have a rule that you can't come back with another habeas with material that you could have produced in the -- in the former habeas?   Antonin Scalia  So time -- time has nothing to do with that.  It's just a separate -- a separate bar.   Antonin Scalia  Do you think 5 years is too long, though?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Wait.  No.  Why do you concede that it would be -- can't the State, if it wishes, give grace to people who did apply late, but because the case is so meritorious or for any other reason?  The issue is whether those people who filed 5 years later and knew that it was very late, whether they are entitled to have their cases heard, not whether the state allows somebody who filed 6 years earlier to have it heard.  How does that do any injustice to the person who knew that 5 years was, you know, you are likely to be denied?   Antonin Scalia  I don't see why the State has to be consistent in it.  If -- as a matter of grace, it can -- it can allow some people, so long as the people who are denied had every reason to believe that they were coming in too late, and 5 years is coming in too late.   Antonin Scalia  But -- but the cases that you are using in which we insisted upon adequacy in the sense of equal treatment of equal people are cases in which the effect of the State decision was to exclude the matter from Federal -- from Federal supervision.  The matter could not come before the Federal courts.   Antonin Scalia  This is something quite different.  This is applying a time limit.  I don't see why we have to apply the same rule and -- and look into the -- whether it's not discretionary.  I mean, to say it's discretionary always means that sometimes similar cases may be treated differently.   Antonin Scalia  So I don't know why you -- you concede that -- that we take an adequacy rule that is used for one purpose and should apply it to a totally different situation.   Antonin Scalia  But none of this is -- is a device as is used in the cases that -- that you are referring to that go into adequacy, a device to exclude the Federal courts from the case.

As I recall, their briefing gives some other definitions from an earlier version of Black's or whatever.  But what they say about the Commission understanding, which you acknowledge to be contrary to your understanding of actual damages, what they say is that at least shows that it isn't clear what actual damages means.  And -- and in their estimation, once you -- once you establish that it isn't clear, then you trigger the -- the -- the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity will not be considered to have any scope except that scope which is clear.   Antonin Scalia  Of course you are talking about statutes that require that the material have been made public, not that say establish a violation if one agency provides the information to another agency?  I mean, as the government points out, this statute goes far beyond any -- any State statutory or common law protections of privacy.  It's really very picky, picky.  And -- and to say that, you know, whatever emotional harm comes from that is -- is quite different from saying that under State privacy laws emotional distress is compensable.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's right.  But all you have to know is that you shouldn't give it to the other agency, because you are not making it public.  You are not doing the kind of thing that constitutes an invasion of privacy under State law.  You just failed, intentionally failed, to follow the very detailed and as I say picky, picky prescriptions contained in the Privacy Act.  To say that you get emotional distress for that as opposed to genuine -- what I would call genuine privacy incursions, which State law covers is a different question.

Now what the government says is, of course, the -- the waiver of sovereign immunity, you would acknowledge must be unambiguous, but the government says further, moreover, the scope of the waiver of -- of sovereign immunity must be unambiguous.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any reason to put the one before the other?   Antonin Scalia  It could mean that, but it need not mean that.  It could mean either that or just -- just part and not whole; and which of the two it means is often decided by the other words with which it's associated.  I mean, if -- if you have a phrase that says, you know, ""tacks, nails and"" -- what?  ""Tacks, nails and wooden pegs. ""  it's clear that ""nails"" doesn't mean toenails; it -- it means a fastener.  And so also here, when -- when it says ""portion, split or percentage"", it seems to me that the natural reading is that portion or percentage means not, as it could mean, the whole, but rather just a portion.   Antonin Scalia  That's not what we have.  We have -- we have a statute that says you shall not take any portion or split.   Antonin Scalia  Okay?

That's immense.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but if we don't then we reject deference to HUD, which you want us to -- to apply.  We can't at one time, at one and the same time, give deference to HUD and yet disagree with what HUD says.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but I assume that HUD's interpretation of a criminal statute like ours must give the defendant the benefit of the doubt, so that if there is any ambiguity -- I mean, that's our standard rule.  If there's a genuine ambiguity, you find for the interpretation that favors the defendant.  And this here, I think this is at the very least ambiguous.  And you are telling me -- well, I guess you're right.  I guess HUD is favoring what would be the defendant in this case?   Antonin Scalia  Wait a minute.  If -- you know, if I charge you an exorbitant amount for cutting down a tree, you know, 2,000, $20,000, then I present my bill, you would say that I have not earned it, simply because it's exorbitant?

And if somebody says, I'm going to give 8 percent, yes, 8 percent with or without points?  I mean, that -- I don't think that the mere fact that the interest rate was 8 percent means that you can't charge points and that any charging of points is a charge for a service not performed.  The service performed is giving you an 8 percent rate.  Now, if she didn't want the points, she should have when it came to the closing say, what are these points for?

So, you know, under (a) a finder's fee is -- is made unlawful, right?

It isn't the order that -- that produces any -- any new fine, is it?   Antonin Scalia  What do -- what do you care?  I mean, you have the fines, don't you?  So why don't you just argue that?  Why do we have to wrestle with the more difficult situation where there are no fines?  It's conceded that there are fines, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  So, you know, sufficient unto the day the evil thereof.  We don't have to consider more difficult cases.  But as I understand it, you can get review by applying for an after-the-fact permit from the Corps, and the only -- the only expense you would incur in order to get that would be to fill in, as the order requires you to do, which is something like what, $27,500 or so?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that such a hard -- a hard hit?  That's a lot less than, you know, 37.5 a day.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but their challenge to the compliance order is simply that they don't have wetlands.  It's the jurisdiction of the EPA.  And surely that can be raised in the -- before the Corps of Engineers, no?   Antonin Scalia  How long does it take to get one of those after-the-fact permits?   Antonin Scalia  Do they issue permits when there are no wetlands?  I thought it was a permit allowing you to do something on wetlands which otherwise would -- would not be allowed?

They've thought about this.  Maybe they got it wrong, but to say it's arbitrary or capricious, you are going to lose.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This wouldn't be a problem if -- if this procedure were not employed.  If there were not this -- this prior compliance order that issues before actual suit by the -- by -- by EPA to hold you liable for violating the act, then you'd just have one -- one suit, and the -- the issue would be clear as to what burden the agency has to sustain.  But it's -- it's really the dual nature of this process that creates the difficulty, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's in the statute.  The agency didn't make that up, right?  The statute provides for compliance orders and it calls them ""compliance orders"", doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, you know, you are not going to be out of the woods.  Even if you get this APA review, okay, some of the factual questions that go to whether these are wetlands or not are going to be decided giving substantial deference to the agency's determination of the facts, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And so even if you lose on that, you might still think you can win when the EPA finally brings a -- a civil action seeking to impose a penalty, where the burden will be on the EPA without -- without any deference to its fact-finding.  So, you still won't know where you are, will you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You've have lost one but you may win the other.  You will have to roll the dice.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but maybe the agency is only entitled to deference when in fact it has made a record.  When it hasn't made a record, maybe there's no reason to give it deference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But then -- they'll just issue warnings is what they'll do.   ",10-1062

""  --cap ""O"" --  ""may subject respondents to: One, civil penalties of up to 32.5. ""  --now 37.5 per day.  That's how it reads.  It could have read:  ""Violation of or failure to comply with the Environmental Protection Act may subject respondents to civil penalties. ""  It's quite specific that it is violation of -- failure to comply with the foregoing Order, which includes not letting -- filling in immediately and so forth.  It says what it says.  It's the violation of the order that -- that the additional penalties are attached to.   Antonin Scalia  It could -- it could as a theoretical matter double the penalties.   Antonin Scalia  You are just saying as a practical matter it doesn't often do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not going to bet my house on that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about those provisions of the original order?  I must say I was not edified by the fact that when litigation was threatened or actually brought the EPA modified its order: Oh, you don't have to plant the trees.  Does it do this as a matter of practice, issue compliance orders that go well beyond what the EPA would -- would demand?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's very nice.  [Laughter]  That's very nice, when you have received something called a compliance order, which says you are subject to penalties of 32.5 for every day of violations.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It shows the high-handedness of the agency, it seems to me, putting in there stuff that is simply not required by the EPA.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose the Corps of Engineers agrees that it is not a wetland and its basis for refusing to issue the permit is: We don't give a permit; you don't need a permit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that binding on the Environmental Protection Agency?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can -- can the EPA issue a warning instead of using this order procedure?  Compliance order procedure?   Antonin Scalia  So they can just dispense with this compliance order and tell the Sacketts: In our view, this is a warning; we believe you are in violation of the act; and you will be subject to -- you are subject to penalties of 37.5 per day for that violation; and to remedy the violation, in our judgment, you have to fill in and you have to plant, you know, pine trees on the lot.  It could do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And there would be no review of that.   Antonin Scalia  Can't you usually obtain a declaratory judgment if prosecution is threatened and you think that there is no basis for it, and you can't -- you are not -- you're not compelled to just stand there and wait for the prosecutor to, to drop the hammer?  Can't you normally bring a declaratory judgment action, saying there is no basis for prosecution?   Antonin Scalia  Well, in those -- maybe with an informal warning, but when you have something as formal as this which shows that the agency does intend to prosecute, why wouldn't you be able to bring a declaratory judgment action?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1062
0,"Antonin Scalia  It's -- it's a formal adversary proceeding in a very limited sense and not in the sense that caused us to require counsel to be provided in criminal proceedings where the other side is armed with the legal knowledge that the poor defendant does not have.  Many of these proceedings do not involve counsel on the other side, do they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm talking about counsel.  Is it not true that many, perhaps most of these proceedings, do not have counsel on the other side?  It is the wife who is trying to get -- a payment of -- of the -- of the defaulted alimony and does not have counsel--   Antonin Scalia  --Why don't you argue for a rule that -- that the State must provide counsel for the defendant in these cases where it has provided counsel or there is paid counsel on the other side?  Wouldn't that be fair?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Waxman, for those of us who think the Due Process Clause doesn't contain whatever we think it ought to contain, but contains what the people who ratified it thought it contained, what's the earliest case that you have which adopts the proposition that you're now espousing, that whenever a civil contempt citation is imposed upon an indigent person, that person is entitled to counsel as a matter of due process?   Antonin Scalia  Whenever there is an erroneous judgment in a civil contempt case, it becomes a criminal contempt case; is that -- is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  My goodness, if -- if you're relying for that proposition only on the fact that we've already said it, why don't you also say we've never said what you want us to say now?  I mean, if that's the only argument, we've already said it.  If it was wrong, we should unsay it.   Antonin Scalia  But if all of the arguments you're making to us are correct, why shouldn't the other accompaniments of a full dress criminal trial apply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So he has counsel, but the burden's been put on him rather than on the State to prove, in fact, that he -- whether or not he is indigent?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's an illogical distinction is what I'm saying.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe Justice Alito can--  MR. WAXMAN -- I'm not sure, but--  --can ask his question.   Antonin Scalia  Why -- why isn't the requirement that the judge satisfy himself that there's a willful failure to comply with the order?  Why doesn't that amount to saying the judge has to satisfy himself that this individual cannot pay, or can pay?   Leondra R. Kruger  Justice--   Antonin Scalia  It's not willful if he can pay.  If he -- if he can't pay.   Leondra R. Kruger  --If he can't pay--   Antonin Scalia  You know what I mean.   Leondra R. Kruger  --I do know what you mean.  I understand you, Justice Scalia.  I think there's two separate questions, both of which concern ability to pay, but one is retrospective and the other is prospective.  The question whether the alleged contemnor has willfully violated a child support order is a retrospective question.  During the -- the alleged contemnor missed child support payments because he wasn't gainfully employed and didn't have the ability to comply.  Then the question for purposes of determining an appropriate sanction is does this person have the present ability to comply, such that sending that person to jail might reasonably be expected to induce them to -- to--   Antonin Scalia  I see.   Leondra R. Kruger  --carry out their financial obligations.   ",10-10XX
1,"Antonin Scalia  Did the Petitioner know about rule 23?  Where had he learned about that?  He didn't have counsel, right?   Antonin Scalia  Okay, before -- before it got up to the--   Antonin Scalia  --Mr. Bibas, I have a question about -- about the position of the government in this case.  The government agrees with you that we don't need counsel, but says that we ought to reverse the judgment anyway, because there were -- because the other aspects of due process which the government asserts would make it unnecessary to provide counsel, did not exist in this case.  Did you think under our ordinary rules we -- we can do that?   Antonin Scalia  Question presented was just whether counsel was necessary, right?   Antonin Scalia  And I suppose it's fully within the power of the government to say why, you know, in general counsel is not necessary because these other procedures are good enough.  But then to come forward and say moreover, those procedures were not applied in this case and therefore you should reverse, that's -- that's a new point, it seems to me, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I would think that the rule would be that if -- if South Carolina has not complied with minimum due process procedures, minimum due process procedures are required, not counsel is required.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand all of this discussion.  The question presented is not what due process procedures are required in these cases.  That is not the question presented.   Antonin Scalia  It is simply whether counsel is necessary.  Isn't that the only matter that we should be discussing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The government is not a party here, is it?   Antonin Scalia  It's just an amicus.  So this expansion of the -- of the question presented from whether counsel was necessary to what are the due process procedures required is all at the suggestion of an amicus; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Could I ask a question about your mootness point?   Antonin Scalia  You say it's not capable of repetition, and yet evading review, because should this happen again, he could get a stay, as he could have gotten in this case.  Do you have any case of ours which -- which uses that reasoning and says the fact that in a future case you may be able to get a stay suffices to establish that this is not capable of repetition yet evading review?  It's -- it's a new argument to me.  Is there any case of ours that applies it?   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, I don't understand how we could say that if you do not meet minimum due process procedures, you must meet more than minimum due process procedures.  I mean, once we say that it's enough if you do A, B, and C, but this State has not done A, B, and C, how can we say therefore you must appoint counsel?  All we can say is you must do A, B, and C.  I don't know of any instance where we impose more than the due process minimum because you have failed to comply with the minimum.   ",10-10XX
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  I mean, my goodness.  You could say the same underlying facts justify, you know, a suit for -- for libel, and also justify a much -- a much greater suit.  I'm not sure that we look to simply the underlying facts.  We look to what kind of liability was sought to be imposed upon the defendant.  That's what determines how much money the defendant is willing to pay for his lawyer, and how much he has to expend in defending.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So how do you calculate that?  I mean that -- that's what the question was.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But that's not why we took the case, to correct the factual application.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So they messed up the application of the but-for test.  I thought the issue before us whether -- was going to be whether the but-for test is a proper test, not whether this particular court, having expressed a proper rule, misapplied it.  don't care about that.   Antonin Scalia  I don't -- you -- you -- you've done this several times in the course of your argument, sort of equating, you know, the attorney's fees for frivolous suits with the normal attorney's fees that the plaintiff gets when the plaintiff is victorious.  I'm not sure that we should treat the two situations about the same, because the plaintiff gets his attorney's fees whenever the plaintiff wins, whenever the plaintiff wins, whereas the defendant gets those fees only when the plaintiff has brought a frivolous suit, which should not have been done, which is wrongful, which is perhaps sanctionable under Rule 11.  I'm not sure that we have to evenhandedly apply the same kind of rules.   INTERRUPTING ",10-114X

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What principle of law that's going to help the lower Federal courts would come out of that holding?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  550?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  830?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How are we supposed to apply that kind of a rule?   Antonin Scalia  Above 830 or below 830?  Which?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It just seems to me not a -- not a patent rule that we could possibly apply.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But doesn't -- doesn't any -- any medical patent rely on natural processes?  I mean, even if you invent a new drug, what that new drug does is -- is natural.  It affects the -- the human physiognomy in a certain natural way.   Antonin Scalia  Is it -- is it therefore precluded from patentability?   Antonin Scalia  What is different here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's another one of your arguments, but one of your arguments says you can't patent nature.   Antonin Scalia  Right, and that relates to the question that I asked.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, tell me why you can't patent nature, then?   Antonin Scalia  Well, excuse me.  Does that render it nonpatentable because it's not novel?  Is that the reason why it -- it renders it nonpatentable?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not what we're talking about here; we are not talking about novelty, are we?   Antonin Scalia  But once you say conventional nature, you are saying it's not novel.  If -- if the step is not conventional, it's okay.  Why?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because it's novel.   Antonin Scalia  What if -- what if they -- what if they just split up the patent?  They -- they got one patent number for arthritis, another patent number for transplants, another patent number for each one of the autoimmune diseases you are talking about?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would each of them be okay, because--   Antonin Scalia  What about--   Antonin Scalia  --What about the discovery of a new physical change in the body caused by an old drug?  You -- you find that it affects another part of the human system.  Is it -- is that discovery patentable?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  Well, I think that's a harder question, but there are, for example -- and I think the Court was looking at some of this in the Caraco case on Monday, follow-on patents with respect to pharmaceutical products, where you patent it originally for one use and then you can later patent it when you discover a different use.  And in fact there is an entire regulatory system set up to deal with that.  So I do think there are circumstances in which that can be patentable, yes.   Antonin Scalia  He says the solution to that is that -- you're saying their patent is not useful.  That would be your defense.   ",10-1150

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Bibas, I have -- this is almost a question of personal privilege.  You -- you make your whole argument on -- on the basis of Landgraf.  So does the government.  You do not cite, the government cites but does not discuss the relevant portion of a -- of a later case which involved the same question, Republic of Austria v. Altmann.  I concurred separately in Landgraf because I thought that the test that the Court was using, upsetting settled expectations, was indeed the proper test for constitutional provisions forbidding ex post facto laws, which is where the Court derived it from, Justice Story's opinion in a New Hampshire constitutional case.  But I said in my concurrence that the proper test for -- for the other issue of retroactivity, namely, constitutionality aside, does this statute mean to be applied only in the future or in the past?  And for that I propose -- well, I'll read you what we said in Altmann:  ""Our approach"" -- which postdates Landgraf.  ""Our approach to retroactivity in this case thus parallels that advanced by Justice Scalia in the concurrence in Landgraf. ""  Quote, and it's quoting the concurrence:  ""The critical issue is not whether the rule affects vested rights or governs substance or procedure, but rather what is the relevant activity that the rule regulates. ""  ""Absent clear statement otherwise, only such relevant activity which occurs after the effective date of the statute is covered. ""  ""Most statutes are meant to regulate primary conduct and hence will not be applied in trials involving conduct that occurred before their effective date. ""  ""But other statutes have a different purpose and therefore a different relative retroactivity event. ""  --""relevant retroactivity event"".  And that is what we have here.  The -- the event that is sought to be regulated is entry into the United States, and it is clear that this statute applies only to prospective entry into the United States.  It doesn't apply to past entry so that those people who came in, in violation of this statute can be deported.  Now, why shouldn't we apply that rule in this case, as we did in the Republic of Austria case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why would it be limited just to the foreign sovereign immunities context?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why do you say that's the majority's approach?   Antonin Scalia  Its -- its holding.   Antonin Scalia  But there are a lot of -- but there are a lot of statutes which we interpret to be valid and not retroactive which have a substantial effect.  You can pass a statute altering the rules of evidence which have the effect of making someone who committed a prior murder convictable, whereas before he was not convictable.  And we don't just look to the effect and say, well, it has that substantial effect so it's operating retroactively.  We say, no, it's a rule of evidence that applies in the future and that evidence can come in.  That's the big problem with this other approach.  There are often adverse effects upon activities that occurred before the statute was enacted, but we still regard the statute as prospective only and therefore not subject to special rules for people who are affected.   Antonin Scalia  We are trying to figure out what Congress intended, right.  We're not talking about constitutionality.  We are talking about a rule that it's presumed that statutes are only prospective, right?  And your argument is the reasonable expectation of Congress when they passed this was that it would only apply to two people who, what, committed the crime or were convicted after the statute passed?  Just as a matter of statutory interpretation?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1211
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose you could say that there's a -- a likelihood of quite inequitable enforcement if indeed you adopt a position we're going to pick up all of these people and send them away.  That's not going to happen.  It'll -- it'll be hit and miss.  And on the other hand, you can enforce it rigorously and equitably upon everyone if you only forbid reentry to those people who want to come back in, and they'll have to, you know, give their names to Immigration, and you can check on -- on this status.  That seems to me a sensible reason.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  I -- I don't know -- I think it would be prospective and unconstitutional because it's irrational.  I mean, not -- not everything that's unconstitutional is unconstitutional -- not everything that is unconstitutional is not prospective, it seems to -- or do you think that's so?  If it's -- if it is unconstitutional in violation of the ex post facto law, the statute has to be pro -- has to be prospective.  I'm sorry, has to be assumed not to cover that prior conduct.  Is that right?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  And if it does, it automatically has to be interpreted not to cover that, by reason of the presumption that--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, yes.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Dreeben, I'd like to get to it now.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I have to give a little prologue to my question.  When -- when wiretapping first came before this Court, we held that it was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because the Fourth Amendment says that the --  ""the people shall be secured in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures; and wiretapping just picked up conversations. ""  ""That's not persons, houses, papers and effects. ""  Later on, we reversed ourselves and, as you mentioned, Katz established the new criterion, which is, is there an invasion of privacy?  Does -- are you obtaining information that a person had a reasonable expectation to be kept private?  I think that was wrong.  I don't think that was the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment.  But nonetheless it's been around for so long, we are not going to overrule that.  However, it is one thing to add that privacy concept to the Fourth Amendment as it originally existed and it is quite something else to use that concept to narrow the Fourth Amendment from what it originally meant.  And it seems to me that when that device is installed against the will of the owner of the car on the car, that is unquestionably a trespass and thereby rendering the owner of the car not secure in his effects -- the car is one of his effects -- against an unreasonable search and seizure.  It is attached to the car against his will, and it is a search because what it obtains is the location of that car from there forward.  Now, why -- why isn't that correct?  Do you deny that it's a trespass?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's too bad.  That doesn't make it a trespass.  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It may be a sneaky thing to do, but -- but every sneaky thing is not a trespass.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So we've narrowed the Fourth Amendment?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the -- the privacy rationale doesn't expand it, but narrows it in some respects.   Antonin Scalia  Undoubtedly, but the rationale of that case was that it was not an unreasonable--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --it was not an unreasonable search.   Antonin Scalia  Don't we have any legislatures out there that could stop this stuff?   ",10-1259
1,"Antonin Scalia  I didn't own my license plate?  I didn't know that.  How do you know that?  [Laughter]  I paid for my license plate.   Antonin Scalia  Well, this is ridiculous.  Look at -- you give the State permission to put the license plate -- to carry -- to have your car carry the State's license plate.  You do not give anybody permission to have your car carry a tracking device.   Antonin Scalia  And whether it's put directly on the car or directly on something that the car is carrying doesn't seem to me to make any difference.   Antonin Scalia  So it doesn't make it a seizure.  That doesn't make it a seizure.  It makes it a search.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you can say that there is a trespass for the purpose of obtaining information, which makes it a search.  But I don't see how it's a seizure.  A seizure, you have to bring something within your control.  You have to stop the person or stop the vehicle.  What has been seized when you -- when you slap a tracking device on a car?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you have any case involving seizure of -- of data floating in the air as opposed to papers?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it must be unconstitutional if it's scary.  [Laughter]  I mean, what is it, the scary provision of what article?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Leckar, your -- all of this discussion, you're going into it, but the questioning leads you into it, it seems to me leaps over the difficult part of your case.  The issue before us is not -- not in the abstract whether this police conduct is unreasonable.  The unreasonableness requirement or the unreasonableness prohibition does not take effect unless there has been a search.  And our cases have said that there is no search when -- when you are in public and where everything that you do is open to -- to the view of people.  That's the hard question in the case, not whether this is unreasonable.  That's not what the Fourth Amendment says, the police can't do anything that's unreasonable.  They can do a lot of stuff that's unreasonable without violating the Fourth Amendment and that -- the protection against that is the legislature.  But you have to establish, if you're going to go with Katz, that there has been an invasion of, of privacy when all that -- all that this is showing is where the car is going on the public streets, where the police could have had round-the-clock surveillance on this individual for a whole month or for 2 months or for 3 months, and that would not have violated anything, would it?   Antonin Scalia  Why?  Because there is no invasion of privacy.  So why is this an invasion of privacy?   Antonin Scalia  100 times zero equals zero.  If -- if there is no invasion of privacy for 1 day, there is no invasion of privacy for 100 hundred days.  Now, it may be unreasonable police conduct, and we can handle that with laws.  But if there is no invasion of privacy, no matter how many days you do it, there is no invasion of privacy.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So is a tail.  So is a tail when the police surveil -- surveil you for, for a month.   Antonin Scalia  Excellent.  Yes.  Of course a legislature can take care of this, whether or not there is an invasion of privacy.  And they can pick 5 days out of the air.  You can't do it for any more than 5 days, or you can't do it to more than -- than 50 people at a time.  They can take care of all of that stuff.  We can't do that in a decision under the -- under the Fourth Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why isn't this precisely the kind of a problem that you should rely upon legislatures to take care of?   Antonin Scalia  I don't see why it's any of Congress's business if it's a -- if it's a purely intrastate operation.  Congress can control police practices that don't violate the Fourth Amendment throughout the country.  I mean, maybe interstate, interstate beepers and interstate tracking devices, yes, but so long as you track within -- within the State isn't that okay?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1259
1,"Antonin Scalia  Of course, Lampf was a disaster, wasn't it?  Congress had to try to patch up what we had done.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but we've -- we've said that, under our recent jurisprudence anyway, we would -- we would treat that as a statute of limitations.  And I assume we'd treat it like a normal statute of limitations subject to tolling?   Jeffrey B. Wall  --Justice--   Antonin Scalia  Do you think whenever -- whenever we encounter a -- a statute of limitations that is -- is phrased in jurisdictional term, there can be no tolling?   Jeffrey B. Wall  --I think, Justice Scalia, that where you have statutes that say there shall be no jurisdiction after a particular time, this Court has read them to cut off equitable tolling after that time.  But Congress could have written the statute to say the time limit shall not be tolled.  And there are statutes like that.  Now, most of those statutes say there shall be no tolling except in particular circumstances, because Congress has considered it more finely.  But they could make the prohibition absolute.  And the second argument that I understand Petitioners to have is basically structural.  They say, well, look, they borrowed the language from the outer prong of the two-prong limit.   Antonin Scalia  I don't -- I think you understate the -- the strength of the Petitioners' argument in -- in this regard.  It seems to me where you say, you know, 3 years unless the plaintiff knows sooner than that, and then you say 2 years unless the plaintiff knows earlier than that, and then you say 2 years, it seems to me that the implication is 2 years, period.  Whether the plaintiff knows earlier, later, doesn't matter.   Jeffrey B. Wall  Justice Scalia, I don't know what else to say except that that would overrule Exploration Company and Delaware State College.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but what if those three provisions had been -- you know, followed each other immediately.  You know, 3 years unless, you know -- with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and 2 years with a cutoff that would make it shorter, and then a third one just says 2 years.  You think there would be no implication that the 2 years means 2 years, period?   Jeffrey B. Wall  I -- I think the implication would be that in the others Congress created a period of repose by using very specific language to do that.  And in the third, it didn't.  It wrote it like an ordinary statute of limitations.  Now, it could have written it differently, Justice Scalia.  It could have said  ""no suit shall be brought after X time. ""  which is the ordinary language of statute of limitations.  ""And that time shall not be tolled. ""  Congress has done that in other statutes.   Antonin Scalia  Maybe -- maybe you'd better go -- well, go on.  I think you better go to the other point, because I want to know whether you differ from the Petitioner on the second point.  As I understand the Petitioner, he does -- he does not think that you reach the same result if indeed the violation had been nonintentional.  Now, do you take that position as well?   Jeffrey B. Wall  --No, Justice Scalia.  I think that is the one place in everything Mr. Landau said where there is daylight between the Petitioners' position and ours.  In the government's view, the traditional equitable rule is the statute is tolled until the plaintiff has actual or constructive notice of the facts underlying her claim.

Unless that was absolutely clear, it seems to me a verdict had not been announced.  She just said how we voted the last time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  When you say she was announcing a decision, then you mean they can't go back on it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  She was announcing a vote.   Antonin Scalia  But that -- so long as it's still tentative thoughts, it doesn't matter.  The jury could have -- suppose the jury went back after this announcement, yes, you know, we've decided on the greater charge or we voted on the greater charge for the defendant, suppose they go back and one of the people who wants to convict on the lesser charge, as to which they are deadlocked, finally says, well, look it, if you won't come along to convict him on the lesser charge, by God, I'm not -- I'm not going to acquit on the greater charge.  Isn't that the kind of stuff that goes on in jury rooms all the time?   Antonin Scalia  So there is no certainty whatever that -- that what was the vote at that time would be the vote when they finally got done.   Antonin Scalia  Only if -- only if, and I think this is the premise of your argument, only if there is a constitutional necessity to, to sever the various charges, there is a constitutional necessity to let the jury come in on one charge without coming in on the other.  It seems to me that's the premise of your argument.  And I don't know where that constitutional necessity comes from.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your manifest necessity depends upon the necessity of severing, yes, if you sever then there is no manifest necessity of resubmitting the greater charge.

0,"Antonin Scalia  It seems to me that -- that the two parties are at extremes and that there is indeed something in the middle.  I mean, you say it has to be the determination of entitlement to compensation by the agency.  The other side says: No, it's just entitlement, whether it's been decreed or not.  Why -- why wouldn't it be an award, however, if it was the employer that voluntarily paid the amount due, which is what he's supposed to do anyway, right?  Why wouldn't that be an award of compensation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, a sense that -- that the text would bear, as opposed to the -- to the sense that the other side argues here.   Antonin Scalia  Where -- well, I wish you would submit the sections of the act that use it that way, that say compensation without an award.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's--   Antonin Scalia  --No, he doesn't.  No, he doesn't.  He can just begin payment.  The -- (c), which is the section we are talking about here, doesn't just provide for newly awarded compensation.  It also says  ""survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits. ""  ""Currently receiving"".  Now, does that mean it has to have been decreed by the agency?  I don't think so.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That clause.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand.  But it -- but it applies to the question, it seems to me, that Justice Ginsburg asked, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  No?   Antonin Scalia  But only if you have been receiving compensation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay?  If neither the employment -- if neither the employer gives you the compensation voluntarily nor as you -- as you contend, there has been an award by the agency, you are out; (c) doesn't apply.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How else would it apply?  You are either receiving compensation, which I would understand to mean receiving it from the employer or by reason of an award, or else you have been newly awarded compensation, which I guess means it hasn't yet been paid, but -- but you have the award in your pocket.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't say that, counsel.  It says ""survivors currently receiving compensation"".  It doesn't say by virtue of an award.  It says ""receiving compensation"".  So if the employer is paying it voluntarily, you are in there.  And then it goes on and it contrasts with receiving compensation those newly awarded compensation.  You are not yet receiving it, but you have been awarded it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  But I'm just trying to make sense out of the provision.  And it doesn't seem to me to make any sense unless you read it just the way I suggested.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't say that.  It says nothing about an award.  The last part talks about an award.  It says  ""currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits. ""  And if you are receiving it from your employer, I don't know why that isn't covered by that.  Why isn't it covered?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think it affects your case.  It's just a matter of understanding what this provision is talking about.   Antonin Scalia  But if the employer has been paying voluntarily, you don't penalize the employee for not having an award, right?  I mean he's in the same position; the employer has conceded the liability.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand why that's so only for employment -- for employer payments and not the case for awards.  If that's so for the employer's payment, why isn't it so for awards that have been decreed?  Why don't they change every year?   Antonin Scalia  Okay, so then my reading makes perfect sense.   Antonin Scalia  You don't really have to establish that, do you?  All you have to establish is that there is no way in which newly awarded compensation means entitlement to compensation.  That's all you have to establish.   Antonin Scalia  You don't have to show that it's used consistently throughout, only that it's never used to mean entitlement to compensation.   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, if I understood your response to my prior line of questioning, you deny that they are treated differently.  The one who is receiving compensation is treated the same, under the same provision.  There are two parts to it: Survivors currently receiving compensation and survivors newly awarded compensation.  Those two classes are treated exactly the same.  The only one that is treated differently is somebody who is neither being paid by the employer nor has yet received an award.   Antonin Scalia  No?   Antonin Scalia  I see.  Partial disability, in other words.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  I mean, it seems to me you have to acknowledge that it would be a much better statute had it been written differently.  And really your argument here is it's not up to us to revise the inadequacies of a statute.  I mean, your argument is you just can't read the language that way.  And it provides a stupid result.  And there are such things as stupid statutes and this is one of them, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Counsel, could I ask you about another inconsistency in this section?  We have gone over one, which I think is there.  Isn't there a group left out of this thing, even under, even under the government's interpretation of it?  What happens to people who are receiving compensation for temporary total disability or for partial disability?  They don't -- they don't come under either one of those two categories, even under the government's interpretation, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, they haven't gotten an award yet.  They have not gotten an award yet and they are only partially disabled or have temporary permanent disability.  They are not covered by (c), are they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, that's right, but they -- but it doesn't take effect--   Antonin Scalia  --during that year.   Antonin Scalia  Well, does that make any sense?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, it doesn't.  But you say the statute doesn't make sense.   Antonin Scalia  That's not a serious--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, you're -- you're making your case harder than it has to be, it seems to me, by saying that it always means an award of compensation by the agency.  I -- I think in -- in 8(d), I don't think it means that, but it certainly means an amount due and not an entitlement.  It means an amount, a specific amount due.  And that explains its meaning elsewhere, but that's quite different from saying that it means entitlement.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, I think that's true, but only because of the earlier portion of 6(c) which -- which covers all other payments that are not by virtue of an award, receiving compensation.   ",10-1399
1,"Antonin Scalia  Your -- I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  We're not talking about how the scheme works.  Grant you that it makes a lot more sense your way, but will you grant that it's not up to us to rewrite the statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  So what we're talking about is whether ""awarded"" in that provision can bear the meaning that you want to give it.  Let's assume that Congress passes a -- a new statute providing for tax credits for -- for each child, okay?  My wife gives birth to a child just before Christmas, and I say: Oh, goody; I've been awarded $2,000.  I wouldn't say that.  That's not a normal use of the language.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I am entitled to it under this statute.  But when the event of having a child occurs, I don't say: $2,000> [""].  You might say it analogously.  I mean, you know: Oh, hey, I've been awarded $2,000.  But that's analogous.  And statutes are not written by analogy; they're written to say what they say.  And I don't know anybody that would use the term ""awarded"" the way you want it used.  The Chief Justice's example is another one: Oh, good, I've been awarded damages.  You haven't been awarded damages.  You're entitled to them.   Antonin Scalia  Let's go through those.   Antonin Scalia  And you -- you show me how -- I agree with you that they don't mean the entry of an award by the agency, but I don't agree with you that the only -- only reading you can give them is entitlement.   Antonin Scalia  933 of the gray brief?   Antonin Scalia  I'm sorry.  Give me a minute.   Antonin Scalia  The language is important, isn't it.   Antonin Scalia  What page?   Antonin Scalia  Okay, got it.   Antonin Scalia  And the language is?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, yes.  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's true.  And what that means is that it can be considered an award if you've gotten it from the employer voluntarily.  That is still an award of compensation.  That's all that that last sentence proves.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, yes.  Yes.  I agree he's wrong.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  No, no, no.  I think he's persuaded me that in -- in the section we're talking about, subsection (c), the only meaning left for ""award"" is an award by the agency, because--   Antonin Scalia  --But -- but you have to show me one other provision at least where the only meaning you can give ""award"" is entitlement to money.   Antonin Scalia  (H)(1)?   Antonin Scalia  ""Upward adjustments to""--   Antonin Scalia  --""compensation to""--   Antonin Scalia  --Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What -- what does  ""awarded compensation at less than the maximum rate. ""  mean?  I'm not sure what that refers to.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Aren't you entitled to get the maximum?  No?   Antonin Scalia  I got you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're right, it doesn't make sense.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, yes.   Antonin Scalia  I agree with that.  You can speak of the statute as awarding something.  But when you use the phrase ""newly awarded"" you are not referring to the enactment of the statute.  You are referring to the time at which the person qualifies under the statute.  And I don't know any usage of that sort that a person -- well, you know, when my wife has a baby, ""I have been awarded money"".  You haven't been awarded money.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, that's what you say.  But, I don't know any common usage that employees the term--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Give me your example again of award used as -- a penalty?   Antonin Scalia  No, no, no; not from the statute.  You, you -- 24--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That wasn't -- you, you gave another example.   Antonin Scalia  No, not a case.

Antonin Scalia  Webster's Third, as I recall, is the dictionary that defines ""imply"" to mean ""infer""--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and ""infer"" to mean ""imply"".

And I do not think that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act would be interpreted to eliminate the sovereign's liability, if indeed this statute provided for it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.

That is to say, these other countries that have jurisdiction, they decide for themselves, don't they, what -- whether there's been a violation of the international norm or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure, national courts have been the deciders when -- when the violation occurs within the nation.  But to give national courts elsewhere the power to determine whether a United States corporation in the United States has violated a norm of international law is something else, it seems to me.

You're confident you can establish not only displacement of Federal common law, but also preemption of State common law, right?   ",10-174X
0,"Antonin Scalia  I'll add a third thing that it goes to and that's Article III standing.  It's clear in our cases, if as you say the relief requested here will not remedy the complaint of these people, you don't have to go to prudential standing.  That it seems to me would deny Article III standing.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand why you assert that the remedy here will not provide the relief -- you acknowledge that, don't you, that the remedy here cannot possibly stop global warming, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It does?  In Massachusetts v. EPA the relief was allowing a Federal agency to regulate the entire society's carbon emissions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think -- do you think that was the holding of Massachusetts v. EPA, that EPA can only regulate the transportation section?   Antonin Scalia  Is that the holding of the case and -- and do you think the -- the -- the forthcoming EPA rules can only govern transportation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course not.  Of course the case covers--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --what the EPA could do.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't think--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't think that they have to have in mind State law for preemption, either.  If indeed the State law just positively conflicts with a Federal statute, it doesn't matter whether Congress had State law in mind, does it?  I don't know--   Antonin Scalia  --But you haven't told us how.  It -- it -- it's certainly not harder to find because for preemption you require congressional intent, whereas here -- whereas for displacement you don't.  That's not the -- that's not the difference.  What -- what is the difference?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're -- you're lumping them all together.  Suppose you lump together all the cows in the country.  Would -- would that allow you to sue all those farmers?  I mean, don't you have to do it defendant by defendant?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Cow by cow, or at least farm by farm?   Antonin Scalia  So you can lump everybody together, so you can lump together all the people in the United States--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --who breathe, I suppose.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.  All -- all homes--   Antonin Scalia  --all homes that -- that emit carbon dioxide in their -- in their heating systems.

Would the EPA's number prevail or your number prevail?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, yes.

I mean, the advantage of -- of the Petitioners' is they use a -- a dictionary definition.  It may be a very broad one and you don't like it for that reason, but it is the way the word is sometimes used.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know any dictionary that would define the word the way you say it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Don't we have to say why?  Don't we have to say why they are they are that?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't usually just say yes, no; you know, we usually give reasons.   Antonin Scalia  Let's talk about the purpose of the statute.  Surely, that should bear upon how you read the -- what you read the words to mean.  I had thought that the purpose was as -- as Petitioner's counsel said, the purpose was to allow people to bring qui tam actions who have their own information and who are not just relying on information that they -- that is not personal to them.  Is that accurate or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He only knows that because of the FOIA response.   Antonin Scalia  Because -- because the agency said we don't have any reports for those 5 years.  Why isn't that information from the agency a report by the agency that we don't have any documents from those 5 years, and, therefore, your client says they didn't file documents for those 5 years?   Antonin Scalia  But your client would search if they weren't filed, and on the basis of no other information except this FOIA response.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How else does your client know that there were no reports filed for these years, which is part of the -- part of the claim here?   Antonin Scalia  He wasn't there during those years, was he?   Antonin Scalia  You don't understand the circumstance.   Antonin Scalia  I don't -- I don't want to have to play these games every time there's -- there's -- there's one of these qui tam actions.  I mean, the advantage of Petitioner's solution is that it -- it's easy -- it's easy to apply.  I don't find yours easy to apply at all.   ",10-188X

Let me ask you: Have you provided ineffective assistance of counsel if you are a lousy bargainer?  You are just no good at the -- you know; I don't know -- the game of bargaining.  And so you do a bad job in bargaining down the sentence, I mean a notoriously bad job.  Is that ineffective assistance of counsel?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't even agree with the first part.  I don't think our legal process is -- is a bargaining game.  It shouldn't be.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, the difference -- that's not the difference at all.  It seems to me the difference is when you plead guilty you deprive yourself of the 24-karat test of fairness, which is trial by jury before nine people who have to find you guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  When you plead guilty, you give up that.  When you don't plead guilty you get what is the best thing in our legal system.  You can't do any better than that.   Antonin Scalia  So your position is you are entitled to effective assistance of counsel before you plead guilty, but you are not entitled to effective assistance of counsel in evaluating plea offers?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Jay, you disagree with the assertion that Justice Breyer made that this was unfair.  This man deserved to get the sentence he got, didn't he?  He had a full and fair trial.  A jury of 12 people, finding him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, determined that he deserved that sentence.  How could it be unfair to give him the sentence that he deserved?

Were they -- were they -- were we answering the question for the same purpose, or were we asking it for purposes of whether Federal regulation could extend to the whole river?  For that purpose, it's easy to say if the whole river is -- you know -- used for commerce, the Federal Government can regulate even those portions of the river that are non-navigable, that -- but that have to be portaged around.  But that's a different question from who -- who owns title to the -- to the bed under the -- the portions that have to be portaged.   Antonin Scalia  But -- but they are closed where they are -- they're impassable for ships anyway.  They're closed.  What do you mean, remain open?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You've -- you've got falls.  You've got waterfalls, you got rapids.  What does it mean to be sure that that river remains open to commerce?  Commerce is impossible over it.   Antonin Scalia  The question is has it held that.  Do you have a case where it would have made a difference?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If this is such an understood and traditional rule, why didn't Montana make its rights known earlier when these private owners bought the land?  Indeed the State gave them condemnation power to flood adjacent lands so that they could build their dams.  And you say while all this was going on, well of course everybody knew that Montana owned this land.  Now they come back what, 100 years later and they not only want to get the land back, they want to tax them for their use of it over all these 100 years?  That's extraordinary.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You are willing to concede on behalf of the State that if we find that the State does not have ownership of the bed, the State does not have regulatory jurisdiction for all of these purposes that you were now describing?

I mean, if the contract of purchase is made apart from the slaughterhouse itself, they -- they could make it unlawful for the -- the person who raises the animals to sell them when they are nonambulatory and unlawful for the slaughterhouse to contract to buy them, right, so long as the contract is off the premises?

[Laughter]   INTERRUPTING ",10-224X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, no, no.  Provisions of the act, at least as amended, also require humane treatment of the animals while they are being processed.  That has nothing to do with whether the meat is any good.  It has to do with humane treatment of the animals.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wait.  You mean the Federal requirements of humane treatment do not apply once the slaughterhouse decides that this animal will not be slaughtered for meat; then the slaughterhouse can do whatever it wants with the poor animal?  That can't be right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about the--   Antonin Scalia  --What about the provision that says that they will not be exposed to sharp -- sharp instruments that can injure them?  Does that apply to only those that are going to be sold for meat.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait, no.  But that act amends, amends, the act that does have a preemption clause.   Antonin Scalia  And therefore it seems to me the preemption clause applies to the humane provisions as well.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just in slaughterhouses.  I mean, to the extent it's incorporated in that act, it only applies to humane treatment by slaughterhouses, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's an additional requirement.  I don't know why it's conflict preemption.  It's express preemption.  If indeed the Federal regulations say that these diseases disqualify the animal from being slaughtered and sold as meat, and California says no, we think additional diseases should disqualify the slaughter and sale, that's an additional requirement.  I don't know how you say that's somehow conflict preemption.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You keep saying ""not within the scope"".  I don't know what you mean by ""not within the scope"".  Why is it not within the scope?   Antonin Scalia  Right, and what -- what limits it?  What enables the State to disqualify other diseases that the Federal law does not disqualify?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  ""No additional requirements"" is what the act says.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it doesn't say that.  It says ""no additional requirements"" with respect to all of the operations, both the operations that pertain to those animals that are later sold as meat and the operations that pertain to those animals that are slaughtered and whose carcasses are burned or disposed of.  How do you get the limitation to only those animals that are -- that are slaughtered for meat?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We are not talking about conflict preemption.  If it said you must and the State says you can't, then there would be conflict preemption.  But we are talking about express preemption, which says in so many words no additional requirements.  And I don't know how you can get around the fact that this is an additional requirement.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think that's what within the scope means.  The preemption provision here in the statute has two provisions.  The first one which is the one we are talking about says requirements within the scope of this chapter with respect to premises, facilities and operations which are in addition to or different than those made under this chapter may not be imposed.  That's the first one, okay?  Requirements within the scope with respect to premises, facilities.  Now the second preemption provision reads:  ""marking, labeling, packaging or ingredient requirements in addition to or different than those made under this chapter. ""  Now, I -- I read the difference between those two being, under number two it has to be different from something that has been made, whereas under number one it just has to be different from anything that could have been made under this chapter.  It's within the scope of the chapter.  It's within the Secretary's authority to prescribe under this chapter.  I think that's what Congress meant by the difference between requirements within the scope and in number two,  ""in addition to or different than those made. ""  and that to my mind is -- is a much more plausible explanation of ""within the scope"" than, you know, it's directed to the purpose of -- of the statute.  I don't think within the scope has anything to do with the purpose.  It has to do with whether the Secretary is authorized to act in this field under the chapter.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The other argument is that it is within the scope of the Act because it is preeminently something that the Secretary is authorized to regulate, this nefarious diamond skin disease which we are all familiar with.  It's within the scope of the Act, because he could act and indeed is -- is told to act to prevent stuff like that.  And that's why it's within the scope of the Act for California to do something in addition to what he has chosen to do.  And that's why there is a difference between one and two, requirements within the scope, and marketing labeling and packaging requirements in addition to or different from those made.  This one isn't made but it is within the scope of what the Secretary could make, and therefore California should butt out.   Antonin Scalia  Suppose I agree with you on that but don't agree with you -- or least I'm dubitante on that and -- and disagree with you on the rest.  What do I do?   INTERRUPTING ",10-224X

Antonin Scalia  Apparently only FELA juries cannot understand it; all other juries find it okay.   Antonin Scalia  Your client is entitled to have the jury disregard a proper instruction, right?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If that's true, that -- everything that's natural and probable is foreseeable, but not everything that's foreseeable is natural and probable, you were requesting a jury instruction that didn't go as far to help you as was possible, but you were still requesting a jury instruction that was on the road.

Antonin Scalia  That's what but-for cause means.  Tell me about the snake.  Is the snake covered?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once you abandon a proximate cause requirement, however you want to define that, I don't see why the snake isn't covered, or the lightning on 42nd Street.

If the -- if the car had not traveled to New York over the speed limit, the -- the passenger wouldn't have been on 42nd Street when the lightning struck.  I mean, how can you say it didn't play a part?  Of course it played a part.   Antonin Scalia  Is that correct?   Antonin Scalia  That negligence didn't play a part?   Antonin Scalia  But for the negligence, the train would not have stopped.  How can you say the negligence didn't play a part?  Had the train not stopped, he wouldn't have been walking along and been bitten by the snake.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean do words mean anything?  How can you possibly say that negligence didn't play a part?  It obviously did.  It seems to me you're arguing for -- not the nonexistence of proximate cause.  Nobody in his right mind could argue for the nonexistence of proximate cause.  You are arguing for some different -- different definition of proximate cause, and I would like to know what that -- what that new definition is, as opposed to the definition that Mr. Rothfeld proposed.   Antonin Scalia  And you don't assert that that's a foreseeable consequence of the negligence of using a wide-body train?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you -- you don't--   Antonin Scalia  --You say it doesn't have to be foreseeable.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, so you -- you conceded that it ought to be foreseeable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm trying to see what your case is because I can't believe you don't believe in proximate cause.  I just think you're -- you're giving a different definition of it, and I'm trying to figure out what your definition of it is.   Antonin Scalia  Do it.  I'm still waiting to hear your instruction, which is supposedly something other than ""but for"".  Is it just ""but for""?   Antonin Scalia  With -- what are the words?  Give me the words.   Antonin Scalia  You don't think that's ""but for""?   Antonin Scalia  I don't care whether I think.  We've got words here.  What do those words mean?   Antonin Scalia  Negligence is a given; the negligence is not what I'm asking about.  I'm asking about causality, and what you have just read is ""but for"" cause.   Antonin Scalia  If the other side doesn't insist on that, the other side -- we'll give you that one.   Antonin Scalia  Well, this jury found it, though.  What -- what would you tell the jury?   Antonin Scalia  This jury found it unclear and asks you.  What would you say?   Antonin Scalia  You think that eliminates but-for cause, to tell them that negligence plays a part, no matter how small, in the injury?  You think that eliminates but-for, rather than invites it?

But that -- that donor is still going to have that -- that senator or whoever it is just as much indebted to him if he gives $10 million, regardless of whether everybody else gets $10 million as well.  How does it -- how does it combat corruption unless -- unless the other side is correct that its whole purpose is to suppress the contribution of $10 million, to make it unworthwhile for anybody to give $10 million?   Antonin Scalia  I don't know how you can say that there's no evidence that it's been deterred.  Is something true just because you say it?  There are in the briefs statistical evidence of how much the population of Arizona has increased and how much less since the enactment of this law the total expenditures have increased.  There was testimony in the, in the district court from individuals who said that they withheld their contributions because of this.  It's -- it's obvious statistically also that many of the expenditures were made late in the game, where perhaps they were not as effective, in order to be unable to trigger the matching funds in time for the opposing candidate to do anything about it.  I do not understand how you can say that there is no evidence.  I mean, maybe you might say I do not find the evidence persuasive, but don't tell me there's no evidence.   Antonin Scalia  Ah.

I would have thought that if I'm an incumbent with name recognition, I would love to be able to not raise any money and just -- just take the public funding, knowing that if worse comes to worse and I have an opponent who does have a lot of independent expenditures for him, I'll be able to get that money free from the State.  It seems to me it's very much pro-incumbent rather than anti-incumbent.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which -- which one should expect campaign finance restrictions to be.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your answer -- your answer depends upon whether you believe that this scheme will keep the expenditures down, or rather, will elevate the expenditures.  And if you believe that it will deter people from making contributions, it will keep the expenditures down.

Antonin Scalia  I mean, what if -- what if the State of Arizona says we're not going to give -- just give money to the other candidates; we're going to send out officers of Arizona to argue on behalf of these other candidates?  That would be clearly banned, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And would you come in and say, well, it's perfectly okay because its purpose is to make public funding attractive to candidates?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So, there's no discretion; is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion, you don't have discretion.   Antonin Scalia  What do you know about -- about the unchallenged fact that the central company had a policy, an announced policy, against sex discrimination, so that it wasn't totally subjective at the managerial level?  It was, you make these hiring decisions, but you do not make them on the basis of sex.  Wasn't that the central policy of the company?   Antonin Scalia  Now, how was -- how was that established?   Antonin Scalia  And that causes them intentionally to discriminate on the basis of sex?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That causes -- how could that possibly cause them to intentionally discriminate on the basis of sex?   Antonin Scalia  That -- that's just an assessment of why the percentage is different.  They differ not only at Wal-Mart, but at -- throughout the industry.  To say that that's the explanation is not to tell your people: Don't promote women.   Antonin Scalia  If you have an aggressive woman, promote her.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Have you sufficiently shown -- despite the fact of an explicit written central policy of no discrimination against women, do you think you've adequately shown that that policy is a fraud, and that what's really going on is that there is a central -- a central policy that promotes discrimination against women?  Do you really think--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Can I just say something here?  Doesn't your class include both those women who were underpaid and both -- and those women who weren't underpaid?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Doesn't your class include both?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that commonality?   Antonin Scalia  What -- what -- what -- what's -- what's your answer assumes is if there is a disparity between the advancement of women and the advancement of men, it can only be attributed to sex discrimination--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, otherwise, how could you say that all -- all of the companies are -- are -- are presumptively engaging in sex discrimination?   Antonin Scalia  See, I wasn't talking about this case.  I was talking about your answer to Justice Alito--   Antonin Scalia  --which said that, you know, it may well be that every industry in the United States is guilty of sex discrimination--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --unless there -- you know, there -- there's equality of promotion for men and women.   Antonin Scalia  This -- this takes evidence, to establish that -- that it's more reliable to have a hearing with evidence on the particular promotion or dismissal of the individual, that that is more reliable than using -- I don't care how admirable a statistical guess you make; I mean is that really a question?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We must have a pretty bad judicial system then.   Antonin Scalia  We should use that in jury trials, too, for really old cases.  We should just put a statistical model before the jury and say, you know, this stuff is too old; so, we'll--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --we'll do it on the basis of -- is this really due process?   Antonin Scalia  In fact it's more than half the class that's gone, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But nobody's leaving yet.   ",10-277X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, this is just the general purpose behind the exception to 301, right, the -- the exception for providing attorney's advice.  The ordinary private litigant doesn't have to show, when he refuses to turn over attorney advice, that there's some conflict which would make it harmful for him to turn that over, does he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Not in the trustee context.  I'm just talking about the normal operation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and so, once you establish that this isn't the normal trust complex, we apply the normal Rule 301 law, and -- and that does not require the person who declines to turn over the information to show why it would really hurt him to turn it over, right?   ",10-382X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Has it ever been applied, to your knowledge, where -- where it was not the case that the trust paid for the attorney's advice out of the trust funds and where the trust did -- where -- where the trust owned the papers that consisted of the attorney's advice?  Is there any case where those two conditions or either one of them did not exist where the -- the trust was required to turn over the attorney's advice?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but, see, that's the argument of the government, that the exception, the trust exception to the extent that it exists, was based principally upon the fact that these papers belonged to the trust and that the attorney's advice had been paid for by the trust, so of course the trustee is entitled to get it.   Antonin Scalia  But you don't have a single case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  Why can't the trustee say: I'm going to hire my own lawyer?  I'm not going to pay this lawyer out of trust funds, so it will be my lawyer, and his advice is only to me and serving my interests?  Why wouldn't -- why wouldn't that suffice?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The trustee cannot hire his own lawyer, you're saying.  So long as he's a trustee, he cannot hire his own lawyer to get advice on how to manage the trust in a way that will avoid his liability.  He just can't do it, right?  Trustees can't--   Antonin Scalia  --Again, as the Chief Justice pointed out, that seems to me an artificial distinction.  What I ask from -- for from the attorney is advice as to how I can manage the trust so as to avoid liability.  I mean, the -- the two are connected.  You can't separate out advice as to how to manage, how to manage the trust from advice as to how to avoid liability.  In the -- in the context of asking, of a trustee's asking advice, the two are the same.   Antonin Scalia  Did it do -- did it do on that basis, retrospective versus prospective?   Antonin Scalia  We're not talking here about competing interests.  I mean, the example you give of -- of the life beneficiary and the remainderman, those are interests of the beneficiaries that conflict.   Antonin Scalia  We're talking here about an interest of the trustee that conflicts with what he is supposed to do, with respect to the person who is the beneficiary of the trust.  That -- that's a totally different situation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And ordinarily if there is that kind of a conflict where the trustee has a personal conflict, he has to step down as trustee.  You can't continue to be trustee when you -- your own financial interests, for example, are against the financial interests of the beneficiary; right?   Antonin Scalia  That's what the government asserts: I have other duties as government besides my duties to the -- to these Indians.   Antonin Scalia  And sometimes those duties conflict with my duties to the Indians.   ",10-382X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I -- I didn't understand that to be your position.  There -- there is a statement in your brief that the question is whether plea negotiations that did not result in a guilty plea constitute a critical confrontation that gives the rise to effective assistance of counsel during such negotiations.  So I thought your position was that so long as the -- the plea negotiations don't result in a guilty plea, effective assistance of counsel doesn't even come into the equation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you can say yes or no.  I mean, you can retract the question on that, I suppose.   Antonin Scalia  When they do not result in a guilty plea.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but we don't care about that.  What do we care about that?  We -- we don't take cases to figure out those -- those picky, picky factual questions.  The issue that I thought was important here is whether this is a critical stage when -- when the defendant is not -- does not accept the -- the plea and plead guilty.   Antonin Scalia  And if it were a critical stage, I suppose that counsel would be ineffective, not only if he was a lousy lawyer and didn't know the law, but if he was a bad negotiator.  I mean -- right?  Being a good criminal lawyer means you -- you got to be a good horse trader, right?   Antonin Scalia  You tell him to turn down a deal that in fact, you know, was a pretty good deal, that would be ineffective assistance of counsel.  So you must -- you must know how to handle yourself in a used car lot, right?   Antonin Scalia  No, but the -- the guilty -- I mean, no, the reason why that is not true is that the guilty plea must be entered with advice of counsel.  You acknowledge that, don't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the guilty plea doesn't erase everything if it has been entered without advice of counsel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have admitted that you got what you deserved, right?   INTERRUPTING ",10-444X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Why?  Why is it unfair for the law to apply to this individual the punishment he deserved for the crime that he committed?  I mean, the object of the system is to put -- is to punish people who commit crimes in a certain degree.  And here he admitted he did the crime and he got the degree of punishment that the law provides.  What could be more fair than that?   Antonin Scalia  Ex ante, I suppose you could say that.  But when you look at it later, it's clear that that would have been unfair.  In fact, this individual was perfectly willing to admit that he had been guilty of more than what the prosecutor had offered.   Antonin Scalia  That's true, and he did that when he entered the plea of guilty.  You do not contest he was well advised when he entered that plea that it was knowledgeable and he admitted that that's what he had done and was willing to accept the degree of punishment prescribed by law.   Antonin Scalia  Doesn't -- doesn't the rule that the plea offer may be withdrawn at any time by the prosecutor -- indeed even after it has been accepted -- doesn't that well enough establish that there is no right to profit from that plea offer, that there is no constitutional right he's being deprived of, given that the prosecutor can withdraw it even after he accepts it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- I had hoped you were making some argument other than the knowing argument, because as prior discussion has shown, even if he had known, it would have made no difference to whether he had accepted the later plea.  Suppose he had been told,  ""by the way, there was an earlier plea. ""  ""It's too late to accept it now. ""  ""Do you want to take this plea? ""  He says,  ""oh, I'd like the earlier plea. ""  ""I'm sorry, the earlier plea is gone. ""  ""Do you want this plea or not. ""  He would have taken it.  What does the knowledge of the earlier lapsed plea have to do with whether his guilty plea is knowing and voluntary?  It doesn't seem to me to have anything to do with that.  So I -- I thought you had some other argument that was somehow a right to profit from the earlier offer.  And I find it hard to see that right, given that the prosecutor can withdraw the offer and indeed even withdraw it after it's accepted.   Antonin Scalia  But if that's ineffective assistance of counsel, surely it's ineffective assistance of counsel to advise him to turn down an offer that he should have snapped up.  Isn't that ineffective assistance as well?  If it's absolutely clear that this was a great deal, and the lawyer said,  ""nah, you shouldn't take it. ""  Is that ineffective assistance or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I gave you the circumstances.  It's clearly a super deal.  Any good lawyer would have told him to take it.  And this lawyer says ""don't take it"".  Is that ineffective assistance?   Antonin Scalia  It would not be?   Antonin Scalia  It would be ineffective assistance and the question would be prejudiced.  Is that it?   Antonin Scalia  Give me -- give me a yes or no to the question whether, if every reasonable lawyer would have told him to snap up this offer but his counsel tells him, no, turn it down.  Yes or no, is that ineffective assistance?   Antonin Scalia  Then we are in the soup.  Because every one of these pleas is subject to the contention that oh, there was an earlier plea, or I should have -- I should have taken it but -- I mean -- and I suppose that if he goes to trial, then you -- you would also say that trial should not have occurred because it was the ineffective assistance of counsel that caused him to turn down the plea.  And therefore, we are going to -- right, retry, set aside the trial?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but at the time that offer could have been withdrawn by the prosecutor.  And you are saying now it can't be withdrawn.  So you are really not putting him back in the situation he was in.   Antonin Scalia  I think that's right.   Antonin Scalia  And that's one of the things that causes us to be suspicious of whether there is a constitutional violation--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --because there really isn't any perfect remedy.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In some cases not even a close to perfect remedy.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure I understand the difference between an open plea and a plea agreement.  He just comes to the judge and says I'm willing to plead to this without the prosecution having offered it?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Well, he could still--   Antonin Scalia  --He could--   Antonin Scalia  --But -- but you're--   ",10-444X

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would you -- would you spend a little bit of time on your other argument, I take it to be a separate argument apart from the -- you know, time limit argument, the argument that the problem here is that this law does not promote the progress of science and useful arts, and therefore does not comply with the Copyright Clause?   Antonin Scalia  Why doesn't it promote the progress of science and the useful arts?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let me put it -- I think it's the same point another way.  Let's assume I'm a multibillionaire and I receive an award as a great patron of the arts because I have furthered the arts by giving several million dollars to someone who has already composed an opera or who has already written a book.  Wouldn't -- wouldn't I be furthering, be viewed as furthering the arts?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's what the copyright law permits -- the -- the -- excluding things from the public domain, so long as in the process of doing it, you're furthering the arts.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, the assumption of this line of questioning, I suppose, is that the mere marketing in the United States of stuff that has already been created promotes the progress of the useful arts.  I'm not sure it promotes the progress of the useful arts.  It makes more money for the guy who wrote it, but doesn't incentivize anybody--   Antonin Scalia  --to create art.   ",10-545X
1,"Antonin Scalia  General Verrilli, I do not find that an appealing argument.  It seems to me Congress either had the power to do this under the Copyright Clause or it didn't.  I don't think that powers that Congress does not have under the Constitution can be acquired by simply obtaining the agreement of the Senate, the President and Zimbabwe.  I do not think a treaty can expand the powers of the Federal government.  I mean, this is either okay under the copyright clause or it isn't.

Antonin Scalia  Can we try whether it's a sham?  I thought you said we couldn't try whether it's a sham.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is a sham different from a pretext?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you would allow the, the government courts to probe behind the church's assertion that this person is a minister?  You would allow that, right?  But once it is determined that the person is a minister, you would not allow the government to decide whether the firing was a pretext?   Antonin Scalia  And that term is a legal term.  What constitutes a minister is -- is decided by the law, not by the church, right?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  What makes it not true?  What is the legal definition of ""minister""?  What is it?  That you have to lead the congregation in their religious services or what?   Antonin Scalia  Okay, but this is -- you're saying a fortiori, but basically you'd be here anyway even if she hadn't been ordained; right?   Antonin Scalia  Which if we adopt your test -- why isn't it a perfectly reasonable test whether the person -- although the person may have a lot of secular duties -- whether the person has substantial religious responsibilities?     --And the reason that is not a satisfactory test is that it fails to take account of the important governmental interests -- for example in this case, in having everyone have access to the -- to the courts--   Antonin Scalia  It's not paramount.  Would you -- would you -- take the firing of the Catholic priest example.  Does that get into the courts?     --No, it doesn't, and the reason--   Antonin Scalia  Why not?     --The reason is -- and that points out, Justice Scalia, that there are ample doctrines to protect church autonomy.  One is that under the Establishment Clause, there can be no reinstatement ordered by a court of someone into an ecclesiastical position.  Another mentioned by General Kruger is that--   Antonin Scalia  But he can sue for money; right?     --I -- I do not believe that he can be reinstated or to get damages for removal from the -- from the priesthood.   Antonin Scalia  He can sue for money.  He can sue for, you know, the loss of--     I think in that case that that is very likely to fail because you're going to run into a -- issues of religious doctrine, or evaluations of distinctly religious matters like EEOC v. Catholic University.  Those doctrines still stand.  The problem with the -- this categorical exception is it sweeps in cases like this one, where the well-pleaded complainant in this case simply says I was dismissed from my employment because I said I was going to make a report to the EEOC, and she's not seeking reinstatement.  She just wants the economic loss -- there's no need--   Antonin Scalia  --Do Lutheran schools and Catholic parochial schools share public funds the same way public schools do?     No, they don't--   Antonin Scalia  What is this argument you're making?  I don't understand.     Because we are no longer -- We are no longer of the of the Agostini v. Felton era, the Employment Division v. Smith where we believe that no governmental rules or involvement can be had with these public institutions.   Antonin Scalia  Don't tell me that fair is fair, that now, you know--     No--   Antonin Scalia  --Just like everybody else.  That's not true.     --It's that we have recognized in your opinion in Smith and in Justice Kennedy's opinion in Rosenberger the value of neutrality where you have doctrines -- If we recognize -- You do not second-guess religious doctrine.

0,"Antonin Scalia  That's extraordinary.  That is extraordinary.  We are talking here about the Free Exercise Clause and about the Establishment Clause, and you say they have no special application?   Antonin Scalia  There is nothing in the Constitution that explicitly prohibits the government from mucking around in a labor organization.  Now, yes, you -- you can by an extension of First Amendment rights derive such a -- but there, black on white in the text of the Constitution are special protections for religion.  And you say that makes no difference?   Antonin Scalia  I think that the balancing of interests is different, according to the Petitioner, when one of the interests is religion.  And you're just denying that.  You're saying: We balance religion the way we balance labor organizations.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's certainly not what the Petitioner is saying.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even with respect to their religion classes and their theology classes?  It's extraordinary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just because -- just because you have to comply with State education requirements on secular subjects, your -- who you pick to -- to teach theology or to teach religion has to be -- has to be subject to State control?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think they -- they merge at all.  Smith didn't involve employment by a church.  It had nothing to do with who -- who the church could employ.  I don't -- I don't see how that has any relevance to this.  I would -- I didn't understand your answer to the Chief Justice's question.  You -- you say that there were different institutional values or government values involved with respect to a -- to a Catholic priest than there is with respect to this Lutheran minister.  Let's assume that a Catholic priest is -- is removed from his duties because he married, okay?  And, and he claims: No, that's not the real reason; the real reason is because I threatened to sue the church.  Okay?  So that reason is just pretextual.  Would you -- would you allow the government to go -- go into the -- into the dismissal of the Catholic priest to see whether indeed it -- it was pretextual?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why is that any different from the Lutheran minister?

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Elwood, for me at least we've -- we've jumped way ahead.  I'm not so much concerned about the vagueness as I am about the proposition that ethical rules adopted by legislatures for voting are subject to review by this Court or by any court under the First Amendment.  This is the first case I'm aware of that we've ever had which makes such an allegation or -- I'm not even aware of any other case in 220 years in Federal courts.  And it's certainly not because legislative rules have not been vague.  The first Congress adopted a rule that, quote,  ""No member shall vote on any question in the event of which he is immediately and particularly interested. ""  I don't consider that very precise.  And the rules adopted by Thomas Jefferson for the Senate,  ""Where the private interests of a member are concerned in a bill or question, he is to withdraw. ""  ""The private interests"", what does that mean?  ""And where such an interest has appeared, his voice is disallowed, even after a division. ""  Now, that's been around in our Congress forever, but our Constitution provides that -- that the rules of the legislature are to be determined by Congress and not by this Court, and I am sure we would not, we would not review those rules.  Now, is there a contradiction between leaving those rules to Congress and the First Amendment?  Do you really think that -- that the two are set in opposition to each other?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're ending up skirmishing on what seems to me a less significant aspect of this case.  This case is enormously important on that major question.  I'm not inclined to resolve it on the question, well, you know, this is too vague.  mean, it's even vaguer than what the first Congress adopted.  It seems to me that just opens, opens the door to future litigation challenging ethical rules, which -- which does not make me happy.   Antonin Scalia  Well, and if they did we would review it.   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that nice.  But the cases come up here anyway, right?   Antonin Scalia  Look, fighting words are words.  They are speech.  There's no doubt that they're speech.  And it's a considerable question whether the vote of a legislature is speech for purposes of the first -- is speech at all, not whether it's a fighting speech or something else, whether it's speech.  It's a vote.   Antonin Scalia  You may be willing to, but I'm not.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Elwood, why is that extraordinary?  Why aren't you willing to accept that?  I mean, if -- if the Speaker of the House counts the votes wrong and he says the ayes have it when it's obvious that the ayes don't have it, do we review that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any greater violation of the principles of democracy than counting the votes wrong in the legislature?  Yet that matter is not reviewable here, is it?   Antonin Scalia  So why is it extraordinary that this one should not be reviewable?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Carrigan -- if -- if we did not review any of these ethical rules applicable to a legislature, at least where the rule is adopted by the legislative body itself, as -- as opposed to being imposed upon it by -- by some other body, there is the protection that all of the legislators are subject to it.  So if it's vague for Mr. Carrigan in this case, it's vague for everybody else as well.   Antonin Scalia  And so it's sort of a self-regulating mechanism.  You--   Antonin Scalia  --You have to be willing to abide by whatever -- whatever vagueness and whatever ethical rules you -- you have opposed -- imposed on somebody else.   ",10-568X
0,"Antonin Scalia  So does this.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Rosenkranz, is -- is the vote of a judge in a case like the vote of a legislator?  Is -- is that speech?

If there's anything vaguer than that I can't imagine what it might be.  Can I get out of all that stuff?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Are you answering my question?  I want to know whether I can get out of this appearance of impropriety stuff.   Antonin Scalia  Why?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What does that have to do with whether the First Amendment applies, with all of its prohibitions against vagueness?   Antonin Scalia  That's too bad, because I would have been much more attracted to your position.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  That's rather exaggerated.  I mean, you have to worry he's going to buy a casino or -- or something like that?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --If that's what it means, you would think the legislature would change it, wouldn't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it doesn't just hurt Mr. Carrigan.  That -- you know, that -- that would be something every legislator would -- would worry about and say, oh, boy, we've got to change this.

Isn't that what willfully means?  You must know that the statement you are making is false.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't want another adverb.  I want you to describe what it means in the context of a statement.  Doesn't it mean that you have to know that the statement you are making is false.  Isn't that enough for willfulness?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Now, you tell me what deceit involves beyond that.   Antonin Scalia  Do you have the text of it?  I don't like counsel getting up here and talking about statutes that they've never put before us.  If you're going to rely on it, we -- we would like to have the text somewhere.   Antonin Scalia  Well, why?  Because it wouldn't be pointless if in fact an attempt to evade or defeat tax does not require a lie, does not require a willful lie.  It would be adding to the -- to the fraud and deceit offenses, 7201, which does not require a lie.  It just requires, you know, going to Cuba and writing postcards saying, I know I owe money, I just ain't gonna pay it.  There is no fraud and deceit there.  It's just what 7201 requires, an attempt to evade or defeat tax.   Antonin Scalia  That's right.  That's my very point.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Without lying -- without lying -- without making a single lie.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  And my point is that it would not have been included within (M)(i).  There is no way that it could be included with (M)(i), because it does not involve or deceit.  It does not involve a lie, as 7206 does.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Who says so?  Who says that they rely on -- you have a local attorney and you have to have a local attorney for the case, don't you?  And -- and you want us to believe that the local attorney is -- has no responsibility for the case at all?  Is this really what the -- what the law requires?  I -- I think there is a serious ethical obligation when he has the -- when he gets the notice.  He's one of the attorneys for your client.  And he got the notice, right?  That one was not returned.   Antonin Scalia  He failed to check with -- with the New York lawyers who were working with him.  Why is it -- why is the State responsible for that?   Antonin Scalia  But, you know, even if local counsel is as you -- as you describe it, and nothing in the record establishes it, even if he is a functionary, surely the function would include when he gets a notice, that he makes sure that the -- the people who do the real work know about the notice.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He didn't perform that function.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  To whom did he make that clear?  You said he made it clear at the outset.  To whom?  And where is that in the record?   Antonin Scalia  His affidavit after -- after the fact, right?   Antonin Scalia  Did -- did he tell the clerk of the court that that was the case?   Antonin Scalia  You know, you know, I'm counsel of record.  He's the counsel of record, right?  I'm counsel of record, but I don't even do so much as to forward notices to the guys that are doing the real work?  Did he tell the clerk that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Extraordinary.   Antonin Scalia  Where does the Constitution say, by the way, that you have to give notice, that every judicial action has to be noticed to the parties to the case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Federal rules don't -- don't require notice, do they.   Antonin Scalia  And the Federal rules don't say it.  You don't have to give notice in the Federal rules, do you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Capital cases are different?  If you are going to go to jail for life you -- you don't get notice, but if -- if it's a capital case--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --No, I mean, it's either a rule for all criminal cases or it's not a rule.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And if -- if it's a rule for all criminal cases, the Federal rules are unconstitutional, you are saying.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once you are in court and you have a lawyer, it's up to your lawyer to follow what goes on in the court.  That's the assumption of the Federal rules.  And it seems to me a perfectly reasonable assumption.  And I'm not about to hold that -- that they are unconstitutional simply because an extraordinary requirement of notice, which is not required by the Constitution, has gone awry.   Antonin Scalia  He can't define his role as a lawyer.  Once he appears before a court and says, I am counsel of record, he has certain responsibilities.  It's not up to him to say what his responsibilities are.   Antonin Scalia  And if they don't extend even to forwarding notice, even to making sure that the people who were doing the leg work in the case know that -- that the clock is running, my goodness, I can't imagine what his responsibility is.  It's not up to him to define it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do we know that he knew all of those facts?   Antonin Scalia  Of course we don't know that.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Garre, can I go back to Justice Kennedy's question?  This was not an appeal.  The question was how many capital cases is there no appeal.  He had been convicted and had appealed, right?   Antonin Scalia  The direct proceedings were over.  He had appealed up to the State supreme court.  Did he seek cert here, too?   Antonin Scalia  He did.  And this was a post-conviction--   Antonin Scalia  --That may be, but I don't think it's extraordinary that there be no appeal post conviction.   Antonin Scalia  It can be allowed, but it would not seem to me extraordinary that it not be sought.   Antonin Scalia  What is the line, Mr. Garre, between abandonment and just plain old negligence?   Antonin Scalia  So if his local counsel simply goofed in not, not advising the people that were doing the leg work in the case, why is that abandonment?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it seems to me it's up to you to produce the facts that would justify our reversing the case that you are asking us to do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You can say, we don't have these facts; well, send -- send it back so I can -- no, you should have gotten the facts in the first place.  If the record doesn't show the things that you need to show to get this case reversed, the case should not be reversed, it seems to me.   Antonin Scalia  When did you first make the abandonment claim?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wasn't it -- wasn't it first made in the -- in the request for rehearing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's rather late.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That isn't abandonment.  The attorneys' actions established cause; that does not mean abandonment to me.   Antonin Scalia  We don't have to adopt the State's position that he was not abandoned, we have to adopt your position that he was abandoned.   INTERRUPTING ",10-63XX

Antonin Scalia  But does that necessarily mean that they've abandoned the case?  It just means you got the wrong address, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Isn't that the only thing it means for sure, these lawyers are no longer here at Sullivan & Cromwell?   Antonin Scalia  I don't know how that would be an indication of abandonment.  Can't you switch a law firm and keep the client?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, he didn't have to send the letter.  That letter had no legal effect, did it?   Antonin Scalia  I mean, it was just: By the way, your time has expired.  I mean, this is not -- what could the lawyer do about it?  It wasn't a required notice that he had to give to the lawyer or to anybody else.   Antonin Scalia  So he just made this extraneous volunteered statement to Maples instead of to his lawyer.  I don't know what that proves.   Antonin Scalia  Well, the argument is that on the record or not is determinative for the out-of-town counsel, but it is not determinative for the in-town counsel.  The fact that he is counsel of record doesn't count, but the fact that those two are, does count.  And only when you combine those two does the man have no counsel.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  Whereas the clerk has to believe that it's an important letter.  Right?  It's not important enough to be required by the Federal rules.  How important is it?   Antonin Scalia  Even if you assume that he had figured it out, that -- you would have to impute his knowledge to the clerk of court to -- to find the -- the fault on the part of the State that's alleged here.   Antonin Scalia  Did he tell the clerk of court that he was only going to send it to Maples?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Neiman, am I correct that under the Alabama rules when an attorney is represented by more than one attorney, the notice does not have to go to all of them?   Antonin Scalia  It can only go to one, right?   Antonin Scalia  So as far as local counsel knew, he was the only one to receive notice of this thing, right?   Antonin Scalia  If we find -- if we find that these lawyers did abandon their client, would there be some sanction imposed upon them by the Bar?  I often wonder, just as when we find that there's been inadequate assistance of counsel in a capital case, does anything happen to the counsel who have been inadequate in a capital case?

1,"Antonin Scalia  How do you explain -- I mean, I think that is a principal point, whether Blake and Brieva changed the law.  How do you explain the language in Matter of Wadud, which antedates by a good deal those two cases, 1984, which says:  ""Section 212(c) can only be invoked in a deportation hearing where the ground of deportation charged is also a ground of inadmissibility. ""  It seems to me that that's the basic point.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, reliance on confused law is certainly not reasonable reliance.  I mean, if you accept the -- the premise that Justice Kagan operates from, how can you say that -- that you're reasonably relying on confused law?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's a different point.

1,"Antonin Scalia  But it isn't good faith here, that's the problem.  We don't have a good faith test, we -- we have a test that goes beyond good faith.  Even if the officer is in good faith, according to the test we have set forth, if he's so stupid that -- that he -- he executes a warrant that no reasonable officer could think was correct, he's -- he's in the pot, right?   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Why are you going back to good faith?  I mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That's -- that is what I think is the problem with this case.  If it's a good faith test, you come out with one result.  But the test we have expressed is not good faith.  This -- this police officer could have been in the best of faith, but if he's a very bad police officer he's in the soup, right?   Antonin Scalia  We don't have a good faith test for this purpose.   Antonin Scalia  So when -- I'm sorry.   Antonin Scalia  But the warrant didn't just authorize, you know, firearms wrapped in gang colors.  It lets him search for any evidence of gang membership, right?   Antonin Scalia  What possible purpose could that serve?   Antonin Scalia  If they were wrapped in it yes.  But we know he is a gang member.   Antonin Scalia  So all that the finding of gang membership decals or whatever they wear, all that would show is indeed this guy was a gang member.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they knew he was in that premises, I mean that -- I really don't understand how you can possibly search for indicia of gang membership when you know the man's a gang member, so what?   Antonin Scalia  What does that depend on, whether you would look for the indicia of gang memberships in places where you wouldn't look for guns, is that it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, if you are looking for photographs that show gang membership, I guess you could look through photograph albums, you wouldn't really look there for guns, would you?   Antonin Scalia  But the most narrow circumstance is defined as a circumstance in which no reasonable police officer could have thought the warrant was correct.  Why don't we adopt a good faith test for this as we do in other -- in other--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Policeman.  Policeman.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't like this mishmash.  Look, it's either good faith or it's -- however good his faith was, however well he showed his good faith by checking with his superiors or what not, if he -- if he made an incompetent decision it's incompetent.  And we should not mix the two, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That would be wonderful if the test was, was this -- did this officer know that this was a bad affidavit and was acting in bad faith in executing it?  If that was the test, then indeed the fact that he had checked with his superiors and all that good stuff would have some relevance.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, you could say that in any test, you know?  If you apply it protectively it will protect.

I think not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ultimately, it's the officer who goes into the Millenders' house, seizes their arms, rifles through their drawers.

Contracts and combinations in -- in restraint of trade are unlawful; but in order to recover under the Sherman Act, you have to show not only that it was unlawful, but that you were harmed by it.   Antonin Scalia  Well, but--   Antonin Scalia  --let -- let's assume that a trustee acts on its own interest and -- and sells property.  But let's assume that he gets top dollar for that property, so that the beneficiary hasn't really been deprived of anything.  What is the injury to the beneficiary?   Antonin Scalia  But it's a different case.  Could Congress decree that the agent in this case shall be an agent of the purchaser rather than an agent of the title insurance company, as is done in real estate, I think?  The real estate broker must be an agent of the seller and not of the purchaser.  Can it establish a trust relationship between the purchaser here and the person selecting the title insurance company?   Antonin Scalia  And if it did, would the violation of that trust relationship constitute injury for -- for Article III purposes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't require injury in fact for most breaches of trust, do we?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I understand, but I'm just saying that that concrete interest can be created by Congress instead of being created by contract.  What difference does it make?  If you become a trustee by contract you get one result, but if you are a trustee by government decree so that you must be a trustee, contract or not, somehow the situation changes?   ",10-708X
1,"Antonin Scalia  You speak of a duty of loyalty.  There is no duty of loyalty owed here.  It was just a law that said you cannot get -- and I'm not even sure it's proper to call it a kickback.  It's a commission.  These people are agents for the title insurance company and they get a commission on -- on every sale of title insurance that they make.  You can call it a kickback, I suppose.  I don't know why the other side does.  But, but -- but it seems to me a commission.  There is no duty of loyalty.  Isn't the -- isn't the seller here the agent of the title insurance company?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We'd have a different -- we'd have a different case then.  But they didn't do that, did they?   Antonin Scalia  Well, the issue isn't whether they can afford it legal protection.  They certainly can.  And there can be suits by -- by the Federal government or I think under this statute even by State, State attorneys general.  The issue isn't whether Congress can achieve that result.  It's whether they can achieve it by permitting private suits.   Antonin Scalia  If I take my car to an auto mechanic, he's not my agent.  He's an independent contractor doing business.  He's not my agent.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it's not an agency relation here, either.  It's a customer going to somebody who is an independent contractor.   Antonin Scalia  It wasn't agents and fiduciaries across the board.  He is neither an agent nor a fiduciary.  And what's the closest case you have to a situation where there is neither an agency relationship nor a trust relationship, and yet this kind of a right to sue without showing damage exists?  What's your -- what's your best shot?   Antonin Scalia  And you don't want to have to prove that, because if you proved any damage, there goes your class action--   Antonin Scalia  --because you don't have commonality.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How does it -- how does it harm her to get a title insurance policy for the price of $453 from what you call a kickback-free seller, as opposed to getting the same title insurance for $453 from a non-kickback-free seller?  Is that an injury-in-fact?   Antonin Scalia  The -- the -- the vague notion of -- of buying it from -- from -- I don't know, a white knight?  Is -- is that the kind of injury-in-fact that our cases talk about?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me purely -- I don't know, philosophical.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That is Congress wanted to get out of the business.  But the issue here is whether Congress can get out of the business, whether it is the function of courts to provide relief to people who haven't been injured.  I mean, that's -- that's -- that's the whole issue.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose -- Mr. Yang, let me -- me give -- give you a hypothetical.  Suppose Congress did this to spare the Attorney General the necessity of suing to enforce these requirements.  Suppose Congress wants to take the burden off the back of the Internal Revenue Service.  So it says that anybody who buys any product from a company that has not paid its taxes is entitled to $500, okay?  What that person is entitled to is a -- a tax-observant seller -- given a national right to a tax-observant seller.  Would every person who buys from some -- some company that hasn't paid its taxes have a cause of action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But this is differentiated.  You have to have bought from one of these companies.  It's not everybody.  Not everybody has bought from these tax cheats.   Antonin Scalia  It's only the people who bought from tax cheats.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  A nexus, right?  Your brief is full of nexus.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Legal jargon for ""connection"".   Antonin Scalia  Lovely.  Say connection, I might add.  I love it.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  How much of a connection is -- is necessary?  Suppose you -- you have a law that requires all machine parts produced by companies to -- to contain a certain feature, and anyone who buys one that doesn't contain that feature gets $500.  I purchase one.  That feature is of no use to me at all.  That product would be just as good for me for the purposes for which I am using it had it not had that feature.  Would that be okay?  Would I have a cause of--   Antonin Scalia  --So even though I've installed my own safety harness, which I always do when I buy a car, I can sue because this car that they sold me didn't have the safety harness.  500 bucks.

You want us to write an opinion that says: Unless you -- unless you ignore the separate corporate existence of the subsidiary -- parenthesis, a question on which we expressed no opinion, close parenthesis -- there can be no jurisdiction in cases like this?  Is that the kind of an opinion that the world is waiting for?   Antonin Scalia  I thought you were saying we should not even -- not even -- not even address the situation where there is no special basis for ignoring the separate incorporation.  I -- of course, we should not get into questions of whether, in fact, the subsidiary was a sham, that there was control, all of that.   Antonin Scalia  But the simple question of whether when you have a totally owned subsidiary, its actions are your actions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Don't we have to reach that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about special jurisdiction?  Why don't -- why we decide this on the basis of special jurisdiction?  It's an accepted basis of jurisdiction.  Citizenship is.  Countries can make it a crime -- in fact I think Italy does, to kill an Italian citizen abroad, and that person can be tried for that crime in Italy.  So I assume that -- that that is an acceptable basis of jurisdiction.  So why don't we say that there's a specialized jurisdiction when a citizen of -- of North Carolina is -- is injured abroad, so long as there is, what -- what is the word?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  One, two, three, four, which ones are they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, the question isn't whether they did that; the question is whether it was right to do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you don't make your point by saying that the court of appeals made a mistake.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, those arrangements could exist with a lot of distributors.  You don't want to ship a distributor stuff that the distributor is not going to be using.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, my goodness.  The fact that you coordinate with your distributor how much of your product you are going to ship to him doesn't -- doesn't really show--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that you are a unitary business with your distributor.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's just not unfairness and undue burden.  It's a matter of what -- what power a sovereign has.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it could be perfectly fair if you announce that you're going to assert jurisdiction over anybody who harms an American citizen anywhere in the world, and you give notice to every manufacturer in the world, that would be perfectly fair.  But you have no power to do that under -- under accepted notions of what a sovereign can do.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Only if you believe that burden is the only issue.

0,"Antonin Scalia  But they could use it for other purposes, right?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  So what the Chief Justice suggested is right, that the purpose is to stop them from using it in order to market their drugs?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's right.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's right, but that -- that is an impediment to their using it for the marketing of drugs.  You're -- you're placing that impediment on it.  Isn't that the obvious purpose of it?  I mean, it doesn't necessarily make it bad, but -- but let's not quibble over what the purpose is.   Antonin Scalia  That's the purpose.  That's the purpose of it, to prevent them from using this information to market their drugs.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's only for that use that you interpose the requirement that the doctor consent.  For all other uses you don't require the doctor's consent, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So -- so the data is not private in the sense that the physician who prescribes knows that nobody will know what he is prescribing and how much he prescribes and how often, because there are a lot of people who do know that, right?   Antonin Scalia  So the only thing it assures the physician, the physician who prescribes, is that he won't be bothered by drug companies who, on the basis of their knowledge of information which other people have, approach him in order to market their drugs?  That's basically all it assures the prescribing physician, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And, and he could achieve the same objective, could he not, by simply refusing to talk to the marketer.  When the marketer says, you know, I want to talk to you about a new drug, he says: I don't talk to drug manufacturers and marketers.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How does it increase the prescribing physician's right of privacy that the data about his prescribing can only be given away but can't be sold?  Does that make him feel happier about his privacy?   Antonin Scalia  He can do that by saying: I don't want to talk to you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That may well be, but then just don't tell me that the purpose is to protect their privacy.  Now you're arguing a totally different purpose: It makes it easier for the physician to cut off approaches by drug companies that want to sell drugs.  If that's the purpose of this statute, it's quite different from protecting his privacy.  His privacy isn't protected by saying you can't sell it but you can give it away.   Antonin Scalia  The information necessary for effective speech is what you're saying, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It only restricts the information necessary for really effective speech?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They're looking for it because it -- it identifies those doctors that they would like to approach with their information which may say, you know, our product is much better than the generic; our quality control is -- you know, whatever.  There are arguments on both sides of those things.  And you are making it more difficult for them to speak by restricting access to information that would enable their speech to be most effective.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's an important position.  If you -- if that indeed was the meaning of the statute, you should have told the court of appeals, don't you think?  Is it enough to say we didn't say no?  You should have said yes.  You should have said this is what it means.   Antonin Scalia  But it doesn't protect his privacy.  I mean, the -- his name and -- and the extent of his prescriptions can be given away for a lot of uses.  It doesn't protect his privacy.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It protect -- it enables him to protect himself against drug companies that want to talk to him.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  All right, so long as I know that's what you're talking about.  When you say ""privacy"", you don't mean the prescriber's concern that people will know that he prescribed certain drugs.  He doesn't care about that, right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That is not protected by this law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not protected by this law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm talking about what this law protects.  It does not protect his privacy in that sense.  It protects his privacy in the sense that it enables him to avoid having to say go away when a salesman for the -- for the -- for the drug company comes, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You mean it doesn't even protect his privacy in the sense that it enables him not to have to say go away.  It doesn't even protect that.  They -- he -- he will still have to say that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --if the drug company approaches him without having this information.   Antonin Scalia  All right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can the State enact a law that, say, petition signers cannot approach somebody unless he has given his prior consent?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course not.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, somebody who comes up to somebody and says: You know, you ought to -- you ought to try to start a prosecution against this person.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They say: Yeah, that's a good idea.  So that person goes and -- and gets a prosecution started.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The person who instigates the instigator?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the instigator of the instigator is -- is a complaining witness or can be?   Antonin Scalia  And you know what the next question's going to be, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The instigator of the instigator of the instigator.  I mean, does this go back forever?   Antonin Scalia  I really don't understand.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand this.  You have one witness in the grand jury proceedings.  That's the only witness.  Can that witness fall within your rule and be the complaining witness?   Antonin Scalia  Just on the basis of the testimony alone?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it's pretty risky to testify in a grand jury proceeding, then, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because even though you haven't -- you don't care whether it comes out that way or not.  You are subpoenaed and even though you are subpoenaed, you are going to hold me as a complaining witness.   Antonin Scalia  Well, the affiants came forward.  That's a different situation, isn't it?  They indeed were self-starting.  But the person who is subpoenaed to testify at a grand jury is not self-starting.  And you're saying that that person's mere presence and the mere fact of that person's testifying is enough to hold him to be the complaining witness.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Hard or impossible?   Antonin Scalia  Hard or impossible?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a different word, thank you.  So the testimony alone cannot be the basis?

He -- he got the U.S. attorney to bring the proceeding.  But he didn't testify.  Could that person be sued?   Antonin Scalia  So all he has to do to get himself off the hook is, after instigating it, he should testify, right?  His testimony bathes him clean, is that it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So all you are arguing, then, is that there has to be some evidence other than the mere testimony; is that your point?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.

Antonin Scalia  It's unrealistic, but that's what you'd say.   Antonin Scalia  Don't -- don't you think that one of the purposes of the legislation, which everybody understood, was to enable engine manufacturers to be able to construct their engines without having to worry about a variety of different State requirements?  Railroading is a national transportation industry, and whoever makes the engine has to know, if I do it this way, it's going to be okay.   Antonin Scalia  And you're saying it won't be okay, because, although every State may have -- every State's requirements may be preempted when the -- when the locomotive is in use, all 50 States can have different requirements with respect to what the design has to be in order to make the engine safe when it's being repaired.  I think that truly frustrates the purpose of the Act.   Antonin Scalia  So what -- I'm not concerned about conflict preemption.  I'm concerned about State requirements that conflict with the Federal.  I'm talking about 50 State requirements that conflict with each other, so that the manufacturer has to look to all 50 States instead of looking to the secretary here, which says your engine is safe if you do this.  And you're telling me the manufacturer can no longer assume that.   Antonin Scalia  Well, what -- what self-abnegation by the Federal Government, that ""safe for use"" does not include safe for use when it's being repaired.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's designed for use.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not talking about the word ""design""; I'm talking about ""design for use"".   Antonin Scalia  What would apply to the repair shop would also apply to the locomotive in use, I, suppose, and it would be of little comfort to the manufacturer that although the engine he has manufactured has been certified as safe for use by the Secretary, he is liable unless he warns the engineer: Oh, it isn't safe for use in these circumstances; I have to give you warning.  I mean, I cannot imagine that that's what -- that that's what the statute means as applied, at least to the use of the engine on the -- on the tracks.   Antonin Scalia  Can the manufacturer be liable for failing to tell the railroad?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How is the railroad going know whether it's unsafe or not?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That is jurisdictional.  If he doesn't do that, there's no jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So -- so the issue is whether (c)(3), which says  ""The certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issue or issues satisfy the showing required. ""  whether that provision is a requirement for the validity of the certificate of appealability.  If it is, then there is no jurisdiction, because the certificate of appealability is invalid.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, let's take the Fourth Amendment, I mean, which says  ""No warrant shall issue but upon probable cause. ""  Okay?  So -- but then it goes on,  ""supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized.

It will just be invalid.   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Millett, it seems to me you beg the question when you say that the issue is whether the appeal will go forward.  That's precisely what -- what the issue is here, whether -- it is that the appeal will go forward or whether an appeal on an identified issue will go forward.  That's exactly what we are talking about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it seems that the structure of the statute wants an appeal to go forward on a particular issue, and -- and not in -- not in general on -- on who knows how many issues.   Antonin Scalia  It says it doesn't come forward, doesn't come forward unless there is a certificate of appealability.   Antonin Scalia  And then it says the certificate of appealability shall indicate which specific issues are issues satisfying the showing required.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Done everything humanly possible and just because of the mistake of a -- of a district judge, it can't go forward.

He makes a mistake about that.  What happens?   Antonin Scalia  The same -- the same terrible result could--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Ms. Millett, as I understand the State, the State is not contending that (c)(2) is jurisdictional, so you're -- you're arguing against a position they haven't taken.

It seemed to me you had something really, really clear and solid until, you said “ reasonable extension ”.   Antonin Scalia  Is that any different from what the defendants are arguing here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They're saying, you know, give a -- give a temporary stay and extend it as long as -- as you need to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're taking their position.   Antonin Scalia  “ Could provide ” means might provide; is that it?   Antonin Scalia  So just a possibility--   Antonin Scalia  --that's all it takes?   Antonin Scalia  Alternatively, we could -- we could rule that indefinite stays are never appropriate; in which case, it would be unnecessary to decide whether any stay is appropriate where -- for a record-based claim, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We can do it from either end.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or we could decide both, I suppose.

Because there are two questions: Is reasonable competence useful for his defense; but, also, the second question, is there a reasonable probability that he can be restored to competence?  The first time, there obviously is that, and you give him a year.  When you come back a second time, you say, well, it's been a year.  They usually come back within 6 to 9 months.

So what -- what use is it--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --to -- to find out these little -- little secret things that your client knows if they cannot be admitted?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Michelman, we have established a different standard for the degree of competence that has to exist in order to prevent execution, right?  The prisoner has to be aware of what is being done and why it's being done.   Antonin Scalia  And that's a much lower standard than the standard of competence required for deciding whether he can assist counsel, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's -- no, it's a much -- it's a much easier standard for the state to establish.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  All he has to know to prevent -- to prevent execution is he has to know that he's being executed for a crime, right?  And--   Antonin Scalia  --in order to assist counsel, doesn't he have to know a lot more than that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, just make believe that I'm right about that, okay, that there are two standards, and one is really quite more difficult than the other.  Why isn't the difference between the standards utterly eliminated?  Because whenever there is a capital case, a habeas petition is filed, and counsel says, my -- my client cannot -- cannot assist me.  Oh, yes, he understands why he's being executed, but he may have a new claim, he may be able to tell me stuff, so we have to stay the execution indefinitely until he can assist -- assist me in continuing his defense.  You've just converted the standard for proceeding with the execution from an easier one to a much more difficult one.   Antonin Scalia  Mental health experts always agree, don't they?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Goldstein, what -- what you propose is reasonable enough, I suppose, and some States could adopt that kind of a protocol instead of what they have.  But what you are asserting is that the Fourth Amendment prohibits them from adopting it, and the obstacle I see is that at the time the Fourth Amendment was adopted, this -- this was standard practice, to strip search people who were admitted to prisons.  So how could it be deemed an unreasonable invasion of privacy when it -- when it was done all the time and nobody thought it was unconstitutional?   Antonin Scalia  That is somehow less of an intrusion on your privacy, to be naked in front of a whole bunch of inmates, rather than one jail official inspecting?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Goldstein, you have acknowledged that we -- we have held that when you have visitors, you may be stripped -- strip searched after the visit, and the same kind of close examination that you object to here.  Now, your explanation why that is okay is that that is voluntary--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That you don't have to have visitors.  Can you really condition your -- your -- your having visitors on your waiver of your Fourth Amendment rights?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are -- are you sure about that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You can -- you can condition certain -- certain privileges upon a waiver of -- of constitutional privileges?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can understand that -- I can understand that for cavity searches, but -- but why for the search to see if -- if the person has any fleas or cooties or, you know, any -- any other communicable disease before he is put into the general population?  Are -- are felons more likely to have those than non-felons?   Antonin Scalia  So that line makes no sense for -- for that aspect of the search which is -- is just we want to make sure that we have a clean prison.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that -- that's where the Fourth Amendment invasion of privacy line is to be drawn?  If you're examined close up by someone who has a medical degree, it's okay?  And on the other hand, if it's someone who does not have a medical degree, it's not okay?   Antonin Scalia  That can't be the line as to whether your privacy is being invaded.   ",10-945X

0,"Antonin Scalia  Right.  And -- and you don't need a magic word, but it seems to me you need something more than a provision dealing with what you have to tell to the people who -- who accept these contracts.  I mean it's not in the substantive part of the statute.  It's in the part of the statute that tells you what provisions of the -- of the act you have to notify the consumer of.  It's a very strange way for Congress to say, ""no arbitration"".  By putting this language in a section that has nothing to do with the rights under the act.  It is intended to be a summary of the rights under the act.   Antonin Scalia  Do you think Gilmer would have come out differently with regard to one of the procedural rights involved in that case if the statute had happened to refer to procedural right as a right?  Procedural rights are rights, aren't they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And so if the statute in Gilmer had referred to one of the procedural rights in passing as a right, do you think that one would have been nonwaivable?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But procedural rights are rights.  To denominate it as a right is--   Antonin Scalia  --Exactly.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you're saying -- in answer to my question you're saying that just because the statute refers to procedural rights as rights, just as we do.  All of a sudden, simply because the statute uses our normal language, procedural rights are elevated to the level of substantive rights and can't be waived.  That can't be right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You are effectively referring to a procedural right as a right creates any inference at all.  It is a right.   Antonin Scalia  Well -- well I guess it goes farther than that, your argument does, it seems to me.  Your argument is the waiver, the non-waiver of rights provision would normally be read to mean non-waiver of substantive rights, but the notice given to the consumer here which refers to the procedural right to sue as a ""right"" eliminates that presumption.  So I presume, therefore, that your position is that all procedural rights under this statute cannot be waived.  Because, I mean, that's what we are talking about, what does right mean--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --when it says rights are not waived?  And our prior case law says ordinarily that means only substantive rights; but here in this statute, it refers to the right to sue which is certainly is a procedural right as a right.  So I presume all the other procedural rights in this statute likewise cannot be waived.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, there are -- none.   ",10-948X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Can I ask whether your second reason doesn't boil down to saying that it makes very little difference whether -- whether Ashcroft is -- is held immune by absolute immunity or by qualified immunity?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once -- once you say that -- that motive is not introducible with regard to the qualified immunity question, and once you say that he's using a witness subpoena, and you can't look behind it as to whether he was abusing it for some other purpose, is there any difference between absolute and qualified immunity?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I thought the -- I thought the argument, rather, was that this is not as close to the core of the prosecutorial function as some of the other functions to which we have given absolute immunity, and since it's so dangerous, since there is such potential for abuse, we shouldn't confer absolute immunity on this particular conduct.  But I don't understand why if we agree with you on qualified immunity, there is any difference whatever.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Was the prosecution already pending when this -- when this warrant was issued?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't see--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't see how that would make any difference to the -- at least to the absolute immunity question.  You wouldn't assert that there is absolute immunity if there's a statute such as this, but there is not if there isn't.  I mean, either this is core prosecutorial function for which he can't be sued or it isn't.  So what difference does this statute make as far -- as far as absolute immunity is concerned?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  So for us to agree with you on absolute immunity, we -- we would have to believe that even if there were no such statute and if a prosecutor simply detained somebody as a material witness without any check of a -- of an independent magistrate, he would be immune?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you can't look behind that, right?  You can't look behind that?  If the -- if the judge has said it's material, that's the end of it; you have absolute immunity, right?

Antonin Scalia  Mr. Jaffer, apart -- apart from the Government's power that you point out to conduct some of this surveillance without approval by the FISA court in an emergency situation for 1 year, leaving that aside, I don't see how the rest of your challenge or your challenge to the remainder of this statute can be characterized as a facial challenge, because it necessarily assumes that the FISA court will mistakenly say that there has been no Fourth Amendment violation, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it -- it can say it's unreasonable because you have unreasonably limited us.  Don't you think the FISA court is able to say, what we're allowed to look into under this statute does not comport with the Fourth Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We have to look into more.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1025
1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Mann, could I come back to your response to the question of Knox, the statement in Knox that -- you know, where the court can issue -- can provide no relief, there is -- there is no standing.  That -- I would have thought your answer to that is -- is not -- I mean, you -- you answered it on the facts, but that statement was not meant to be exclusive, that that's the only situation in which there -- there is no standing.  It was addressing just the third prong of our -- of our standing doctrine, namely the prong that where the court can issue no relief, the remedial -- the remedial prong, that one of -- one of the elements of standing is the court has to be able to provide relief.  But there are other elements to standing as well, including whether there is injury in fact, and whether the injury is -- you know, springs from the action that is challenged.  And those -- those prongs would continue to exist.  I didn't think Knox's statement was meant to be all inclusive, that that's the only -- only way in which standing can be eliminated.   Antonin Scalia  Equity is wonderful.   Antonin Scalia  I'll bet you equity could have considered the husband to have been substituted automatically and could have been considered the estate to have been substituted automatically.  That -- that happens when that particular element is eliminated.  But there is nothing automatic about discovering some new plaintiff who is out -- we don't know who is out there.   ",11-1059
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, it undermines the collective aspect if she never brings the suit in the first place.  I mean, I must say I'm not terribly impressed by the fact that, you know, if she drops out there is -- there is no collective suit for these other people.  There is also no collective suit for these other people if she never appeared in the first place.  I don't know that the law demands that there be a collective suit.  If she doesn't bring suit or if she brings suit and is given everything she wants, the case is over unless other people have come in.   Antonin Scalia  It -- it's hard for me to accept the relation-back doctrine for your purposes when -- when it's clear under the statute that if parties come in beyond the statute of limitations period, they're not in.  Their -- their entry is not deemed to relate back to the filing of the original complaint, is it?   Antonin Scalia  For purposes of the statute of -- so you want one relation-back doctrine for the statute and a different one for what we're discussing here.

Antonin Scalia  Mr. Yang, would -- would you continue with what you started speaking to, issue preclusion, because I'm -- I'm also -- I think it's questionable whether there would be issue preclusion on the basis of a judgment issued with the concession of the defendant.

So I apologize for interrupting but--   Antonin Scalia  --but you leave me no alternative.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, I understand.   Antonin Scalia  Is it not the case that one of the other elements necessary for the fraud-on-the-market theory would also be decided conclusively for future individual litigants, namely the efficiency of the market?  A future litigant will ordinarily claim: I either sold it at a depressed price or bought it at an inflated price because of the market's reaction to this particular fraudulent statement.   Antonin Scalia  So -- so you can say the same thing about the efficiency of the -- of the market being determined in this preliminary question as you can say about -- about the issue here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You -- you don't have to prove it to get the class certified.  You only have to prove it to get the class certified with the benefit of the fraud-on-the-market theory.   Antonin Scalia  Which is a shortcut to getting the class certified, right?   Antonin Scalia  So this is just a condition to the shortcut.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1085
0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Frederick, you -- you say that, you know, it's a flukey hypothetical where -- where the -- the issue here would -- would come up again in a different context in an individual suit.  Let -- let me give you a -- a case that's not flukey and hypothetical.  That is, it is usually the case that people who are allegedly defrauded in stocks rely upon the fact that they bought it at an -- at an inflated price or sold it at a depressed price.  Both of those questions depend upon the efficiency of the market.  If the market is not efficient, a question that has to be decided for the class certification case, the individual investor is not going to be able to say, you know, that's -- that's why I got cheated, because the market reflected this false statement and I paid more money for the stock than I should have.  That -- that is not a flukey hypothetical.  That is what will happen in most individual cases.  And yet, that question of the efficiency of the market has to be decided at the class certification stage.   Antonin Scalia  You could say the same about materiality.  If it's immaterial, it isn't reflected in -- in the market.   Antonin Scalia  So -- so the difference you assert is that, with respect to the issue here, it will be an issue in all individual cases, whereas with regard to the efficiency of the market it will only be an issue in what, 95 percent of -- of the individual cases?   Antonin Scalia  The issue -- the issue is not whether -- whether it's a common question or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The issue is whether there's any reason to believe that the -- that the market reflects reality.   Antonin Scalia  That's the issue.   Antonin Scalia  But there is -- there is a reason for deciding it earlier, and the reason is the -- the enormous pressure to settle once the class is certified.  In most cases, that's the end of the lawsuit.  There's -- there's automatically a settlement.  Now, one way of -- of certifying the class is to show, well, you know, it's an efficient market and you can presume that everybody in the class relied on the market.  But that's only true if -- if the -- the statement was material to the market.  If it was immaterial to the market, that isn't true.  And you should not proceed any further, and you should not begin this -- this class action which, in most cases, is simply the preliminary to a settlement.  There is a good reason for deciding it sooner.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the difference between 100 percent and 95 percent?  I mean, most of the other claims in -- in stock cases are going to be based on what -- what the market price was when the person bought or sold.  So, you know, 95 percent instead of 100 percent, that's -- that's the basic difference?   Antonin Scalia  If you have the same question, then maybe we shouldn't have this fraud-on-the-market theory.  Because the whole purpose of it is -- is to -- to assume that -- that the whole class was -- was damaged and relied -- because you can rely on an efficient market.  But you can only rely on an efficient market where there has been a material misrepresentation.  So maybe we should overrule Basic because it was certainly based upon a theory that -- that simply collapses once you remove the materiality element.   Antonin Scalia  Materiality is a common issue.  Reliance is only a common issue if you accept the fraud-on-the-market theory.  That's the problem.  And you are using the one, which is a common issue, to leapfrog into the second, to make the efficiency of the market reasoning something that it isn't.   ",11-1085
1,"Antonin Scalia  Ms. Webre, is there any binding effect of a Federal determination here on State law, and is there any binding effect of any State determination here on Federal law?   Antonin Scalia  If it was left to the State, would what the States say about patent law be binding in any Federal cases, and, vice versa, if it went to the Federal jurisdiction, would anything that the Federal court says about -- about State tort law be binding on State courts?   Antonin Scalia  That -- that being so, your -- your last argument about the Federal government messing up -- you know, State tort law in an area that -- that is currently very much in the fore in the -- in the decisions of the Texas Supreme Court, that doesn't really carry a lot of weight, except in this single case.  I mean, they are not going to mess up Texas law in that regard.  They may get this case wrong, but--   Antonin Scalia  --What about the Federal issue?  Doesn't that need resolving?   Antonin Scalia  Why -- why do all -- why do all of these issues cut in your favor in all cases involving malpractice?  I mean, you're urging not just that your client win here, but you want us to adopt a general rule that malpractice suits involving patent rights can never, ever, come under “ Federal arising ” under jurisdiction.  Isn't that -- isn't that what you want us to say?   Antonin Scalia  So the burden would be on you to show that every one of these factors in all of those cases is always going to cut in your favor.  That -- what, that they will never involve a constitutional issue?  That they will never, ever determine future patent decisions?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I like -- I like bright-line rules.  In fact -- you know, I thought Holmes had it right.  It doesn't arise under unless the cause of action is a Federal cause of action.  But once we've gone down -- down the road of Grable, I don't -- you're -- you're proving a negative.  The burden is on you to prove a negative, that there is no situation that can arise in -- in malpractice cases involving patents where the Federal issue would justify arising.  A hard road to hoe.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I guess you might argue that even if it fails the Grable test in a couple of isolated cases, we should still adopt that rule, because the benefits of having a clear rule that doesn't have to be litigated in every -- every case outweigh the fact that one or two might -- might not come out that way if we applied Grable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because we're making it up anyway, right?   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Webre, can I ask you about the question presented?  The way you presented it to us, it -- it was as though we're -- we're reviewing whether the Federal circuit was right to reject Grable in -- in whatever the names of those opinions are.  But in fact, that's not the situation at all.  The Texas Supreme Court here applied Grable.  And I think just the way you would want it applied.  So your -- your -- your contention is simply they didn't apply it correctly.  Isn't that right?     ",11-1118
0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I guess I just don't understand this.  Is it the case that there is “ arising under ” jurisdiction only when the Federal cause of action presented is one over which Federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that the rule?   Antonin Scalia  Any Federal statute that can be sued upon both in Federal courts and in State courts, but as to which Federal courts are the dispositive adjudicators, you say that that does not come within this “ arising under ” rule?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have a case for that, that says if a suit could be brought in State court even though it involves a dispositive Federal question as to which this Court would be the -- you know, the last interpreter, it cannot possibly come within “ arising under ” jurisdiction?  Have you got a case for that?   Antonin Scalia  Do you have a case which says that when a Federal question is presented in a case over which Federal courts have jurisdiction but also State courts have jurisdiction, although, needless to say, the Federal courts would be dispositive on the issue, such a case cannot come within the “ arising under ” jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I would find it extraordinary for that to be the rule.   Antonin Scalia  Is that -- my goodness, but you are going to have a purely hypothetical State decision here.  The State will have held that -- you know, if he had said this, the result would have been something else.  And you think that that precludes the issue when it arises in real life?  And you say since the State court made that hypothetical determination it precludes me from arguing it in real life?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you have any cases like that?  It seems to me a rather weird, weird situation.  I mean, maybe it could, but it's strange.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They knew -- they knew these were controverted issues.  You say that they are controverted issues.  So they would have been alerted to a problem anyway, and they certainly would not accept a State court determination as authoritative resolution of that problem.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --the patent attorneys.  I mean, you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Excuse me.  The State courts are not bound by the Federal court's holding?  You mean State courts can resolve patent questions, contrary to what the Supreme Court of the United States says the law is?   Antonin Scalia  Why is that worse than the fact that if it goes to Federal court, all of the lawyers in the State in all malpractice cases are going to be supposedly bound by the Federal court's holding as to State issues of malpractice?  I mean, it seems to me it's Twiddle Dum or Twiddle Dee, whichever court system you go to, you are going to terrorize the lawyers of that State on the basis of an opinion of a court that is not dispositive on those issues.  So I don't know why--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --And you are trying the malpractice lawsuit, the State practice malpractice lawsuit, in Federal court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you are talking about a patent case that has a patent issue, whether it's a contract case, a tort case, a malpractice case -- if it has a patent issue, you think it has to go to Federal court.   Antonin Scalia  Well, then I repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, how do you decide which of those do and which of those don't?   Antonin Scalia  My experience is that Federal judges, including this Federal judge, are not interested in -- in getting into the weeds of patent law, and if -- if they could rely on a decision of the Federal circuit, they would do that just as fast as they can.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that's -- and that's a general corporate power.  Every corporation in Georgia has the power to acquire, including acquire other businesses.   Antonin Scalia  Well, a lot of States have that.  You can't open a new hospital without getting a certificate of need.  Are you saying that in all of those States the result is that the antitrust laws can be ignored?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Waxman, if you don't want to be interrupted, you have to pause between sentences.   Antonin Scalia  I understand.  That's right.  You've given a -- you know, an appealing example of a small county that has one -- one hospital, and this operation purchases that one hospital.  Seems nothing wrong with that; although, as Justice Sotomayor suggests, I doubt whether the FTC would be pursuing a situation in which there is a natural monopoly.  It's a question of whether the monopoly would be owned by the state or not.  But your argument, if we follow it, embraces a quite different situation, a very large county which has five hospitals that are competing vigorously in price, in specialties, they advertise on the radio, as some hospitals do.  And what you're saying is that this operation can take over all of those hospitals and eliminate all of that competition.  Isn't that so?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We have no -- we have no idea whether they are willing to do that.   Antonin Scalia  And we have a Federal antitrust law.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But, you know, the -- the exception suggests another thing besides the fact that it suggests that the only way the second spouse prevails is by a divorce decree.  It also suggests that Congress's sole purpose -- that Congress did not have the sole purpose in this statute to make it easy for the insurance company that has to pay out the proceeds to know whom the -- who the beneficiary will be.  If that were the case, there wouldn't be this exception for a divorce decree, because the insurance company is going to have to look to see if there's a divorce decree on the books, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  That obviously shows that Congress in this statute not only had a concern about efficiency of payment, but also had a concern about who gets the payment, right?  There's no other way to explain the -- the exception for divorce decrees.   Antonin Scalia  And you think that's the -- that's the purpose of this exception for divorce decrees?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In your experience, a man usually has more children or children in his second marriage than he did in his first?   Antonin Scalia  No, I don't think so, either.

You know, just look at the -- look at the -- at the contract, the named beneficiary, pay the money to the named beneficiary, and you're home free.  That -- that is blown away by the exception for divorce decrees.  The insurer is going to have to check that there hasn't been a divorce since the contract was signed, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  They have to check to see if it has been properly filed, right?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You'd expect that -- you'd expect there to be some cases in a couple of hundred years.   Antonin Scalia  Fraud is nothing new, for Pete's sake.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is brand-new assertion by the government that -- tell -- is there much difference between the rule you are arguing for and a rule that there is no statute of limitations?   Antonin Scalia  It's not a matter of there being nothing on either side of the ledger.  What's extraordinary is that the government has never asserted this, except in the 19th century, when it was rebuffed and repudiated its position.  It isn't just that there are no cases against you.  It's you've never -- the government has never asserted it before.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The False Claims Act example you give is indeed a private plaintiff kind of a case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, you can say the government, having been cheated, should have known it was cheated.  But we are talking here about prosecution, essentially, prosecution for a civil penalty rather than a criminal.  By the way, doesn't the rule of lenity apply whether the penalty is criminal or civil?  So if I think the word “ accrual ” is at best ambiguous, shouldn't the tie go to the defendant?   Antonin Scalia  But my question is broader than that.  Does the rule of lenity not apply to all penalties?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are you sure of that?  My belief is the contrary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it's an important issue in this case surely.  I mean, if “ accrual ” is ambiguous and we have a rule of lenity, we should interpret it to favor the defendant.   Antonin Scalia  He didn't concede that there was fraudulent concealment.  All he conceded is that there was fraud, but later concealment to cover up that fraud I don't think has been conceded.   Antonin Scalia  Except that concealment is sort -- you know, it's sort of a self-starter.  You -- you -- it -- it doesn't apply always.  It applies when there is concealment, and the person who is being subjected to the longer statute of limitations is on notice that if he fraudulently conceals, he's extending the statute.  So I -- I don't think that the one has to go with the other.  Maybe they're both equitable doctrines, but that doesn't -- that doesn't mean that we have to apply them to this statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And for 300 years, that has been said only with respect to civil actions, not with respect to the government's attempt to exact a penalty.   Antonin Scalia  And you will say nonsense in that future case, won't you?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  What about criminal penalties?  Would your argument be different with regard to criminal?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Incidentally, what makes something a civil penalty?  You just call it a civil penalty and you don't have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt, and you get the benefit of this extension that you are arguing for?   Antonin Scalia  What makes a penalty a civil penalty?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, a penalty is a penalty as far as I'm concerned if the Government's taking money from me.   Antonin Scalia  That's nice.   Antonin Scalia  That isn't my point, that it is criminal.  My point is, it doesn't seem to me to make a whole lot of difference as far as these issues are concerned.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Counsel, I guess your opponent could have raised that point.   Antonin Scalia  And didn't raise it.   Antonin Scalia  And we took this case on the assumption that there is an issue of law involved--   Antonin Scalia  --not -- not on the assumption--   Antonin Scalia  --You say, “ they ”.  I assume you mean their lawyer.   Antonin Scalia  This is not, you know, an ignorant layman who knows nothing about the law.   Antonin Scalia  The lawyer, you say, did not ask for the plan.   Antonin Scalia  That's not unusual.  The motto is equity follows the law.  Doesn't -- doesn't that usually -- isn't that usually the case?   Antonin Scalia  Where there is a legal right, equity cannot overcome it.   Antonin Scalia  Equitable powers to enforce the agreement.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think you can say that about any legal rule, that some courts bollox them up.  I mean, that means the rule doesn't exist, because it's sometimes used in a confusing way?   Antonin Scalia  What's the rule?  Do you acknowledge that that is the rule?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was there an agreement that contradicted that?   Antonin Scalia  But we have an agreement here, so how does -- how does that line of authority apply?  Because we have an agreement which says that the insurance company gets all the money.  So you either say that that agreement can be overcome by equity, or else you say the agreement prevails.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it only has the powers to enforce the agreement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There are various equitable powers, and it can use various of them to enforce the agreement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's quite different from rewriting the agreement, which is what you are using it for here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Do you really think that if -- if an equity court finds the agreement to be unfair, it can say, he who seeks equity must do equity, and rewrite the agreement so that it's fairer?   Antonin Scalia  We never doubted that before.  Was it thought before that all the equitable powers did not exist under ERISA?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to be self-evident that court had all equitable powers.  That's not a change in the law.  It's just a restatement of the obvious.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1285

You have to tell us why this is a subrogation agreement, even though you conceded below that it isn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not what I say you've conceded.  That's a common fund doctrine.  Your opponent denies that the common fund doctrine applies.  And it says this is an equitable lien by agreement, so that the common fund doctrine doesn't apply.  Now, you say it is not an equitable lien by agreement, is that your position?   Antonin Scalia  So whenever you have a contract that explicitly, although, you know, nowadays when the merged bars, I suppose, you wouldn't even have to say it, but let's assume it explicitly says that rights under this contract can be enforced in law or -- at law or in equity.  Whenever -- whenever you have a contract like that, it's going to be up to the court of equity to decide whether it's fair?   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't this a legal claim?  It -- it's -- it's a promise made in a contract.  Why is that not a legal claim?  To be sure, the contract says that -- that, you know, all equitable remedies are available to enforce that claim.

It's not as though this procedure existed at the time of the founding or in English law before then, and was never adequate to -- to constitute double jeopardy.  It's a new procedure introduced, so the question for the Court was, well, you know, if it's the judge rather than the jury that pronounces the acquittal, does -- does that constitute double jeopardy?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's every misinterpretation.  I mean, I don't know why this case doesn't involve simply a misinterpretation of what the elements of the crime are.  I mean, any misinterpretation you can -- which goes beyond the minimum that the -- that the statute requires can be recharacterized as adding an additional element.

Antonin Scalia  Of course we don't know why they disapproved.  And I guess your point is they may well not have permitted it because they were under what you would call the mistaken belief that it was unconstitutional.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Koester, in most jurisdictions, unless I'm mistaken, the cop on the beat cannot apply for and get a search warrant.  He has to go through a prosecuting attorney or someone in the prosecutor's office first.  So it's not just getting hold of a judge.

Well, you know, two weeks ago we had this informer, yesterday we saw this and so, you know, all sorts of different factors.  In these DUI cases it's always going to be the same thing.  The policeman is going to say, well, you know, his breath smelled of alcohol; we gave him the walk a straight line and turn around test, he flunked it; he couldn't touch his nose with his index finger.  What is the impartial magistrate possibly going to do except to say, hey, you know, that's probable cause.  Are any of these warrants ever turned down?  Are they ever turned down in your experience?   Antonin Scalia  I bet you they're not.

Whereas, in all of these cases it's going to be the same thing: His breath smelled of alcohol, he couldn't walk a straight line, and whatnot.  And that's the probable cause.

Antonin Scalia  Very often I could decide a case -- you know, the lower courts are running away from the question of deference vel non because things have been so confused by Meade.  So they simply decide the question assuming no deference to the agency.  That doesn't prove that in that particular case the agency wouldn't have been entitled to deference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whether it was or not, it would have come out this way.  So those three cases don't prove what you say they prove.   Antonin Scalia  Before you get to that, I'm really surprised at your response to Justice Kennedy that you agree that, even where the agency has no jurisdiction, although you won't give Chevron deference, you will give whatever the other kind of deference.   Antonin Scalia  Why would you give Skidmore deference if some non-jurisdictional agency comes in and says, hey, by the way, court, you know, I think this is the right answer?  Oh, we will listen to that respectfully.  We won't necessarily give you Chevron -- why would you give it any deference at all if there is no jurisdiction?   Antonin Scalia  And that's all you think that Skidmore deference means?  You will listen to opinions that make sense, right?   Antonin Scalia  But just to agency opinions it makes sense, not to--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Suppose I didn't know that and I'm just looking at the text, okay?   Antonin Scalia  There are innumerable statutes which, after giving the agency rule-making authority, provide judicial -- you know, review under this statute shall be held in such-and-such a court.  There is no conflict whatever between a statement that any person affected can sue in Federal court and the possession by an agency of rule-making authority.  The two simply don't conflict.

[Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Justice Breyer would replace that with a rule where they like the agency to have authority, it has it, and where they don't like it to have authority, it doesn't.  I'm not sure that's any better than--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --a description of the Chevron--   Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand the question, to tell you the truth.  This matter is not left with the States.  It's going to be decided by a federal instrumentality, right?  Either by the agency, which says 30 days is the rule, or by federal courts, which perhaps could issue opinions that say 30 days is the rule.  I mean, this -- you know, it's an interesting separation of powers question within the federal government, but I don't see how it's a question of whether it's the states or the federal government that's going to call the tune here.  It's going to be the federal government, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Don't you think that the--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Don't you think that the issue of whether unelected federal bureaucrats should decide it or unelected federal judges should decide it is an issue of separation of powers rather than an issue of -- of federal/state relations?

You don't know exactly what it means, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Verrilli, why isn't it an easy answer to the whole case to read (7)(A).  Except as provided in this paragraph.  Nothing in this chapter shall limit or affect the authority of State or local government?  Okay?  And then later in the paragraph, in the subsection entitled “ limitations ”, it says  ""a State or local government shall act on any request for authorization within a reasonable period of time.

Antonin Scalia  You rely only on that -- on that definition?  The section is entitled  ""Old Age and Survivors' Insurance Benefit Payments. ""  and it also provides in (d) that a child is entitled to the benefits if, among other things,  ""(c), was dependent upon such individual, (1), if such individual is living at the time that the application was filed; (2), if such individual has died at the time of death; or (3), if such individual had a period of disability.

I don't see how it has anything to do with whether the child was dependent under (d)(1)(C).  Why do you think it has something to do with that?   Antonin Scalia  Well, unless such individual was not living with or contributing to the support of such child, which is certainly the case here -- the child had not yet been born -- and other qualifications.  The principal condition does not exist.  ""Shall be deemed dependent upon his father or adopting father unless at such time such individual, mother or father or adopted father, was not living with or contributing to the support of such child. ""  How does that alter the dependency requirement of (d)(1)(C)?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that may well be.  If that is ambiguous, why doesn't -- why doesn't (d)(1)(C), despite -- what is it (h)(3) or whatever the 3 we've been playing with here, despite (d)(3), despite that it seems to me that they don't meet that requirement.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You want us to probe their mind and say, well, since 90 percent of all children were children of married people, that's what they must have meant by child.  I just don't think that follows at all.  ""Child"" means child.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It disfavors children who are born after the father has died.

Wouldn't that always be a -- a frailty of whatever -- whatever price it sold for?  Wouldn't it always be?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that might be, but it doesn't -- it doesn't take a genius to figure out that if you allow people to bid for cash or for credit, you are going to get more bids and higher bids than if you allow them to bid for cash only.

But all that means is that the Government can set forth the rules concerning who belongs in this country.  But if, in fact, somebody who does not belong in this country is in Arizona, Arizona has no power?  What does sovereignty mean if it does not include the ability to defend your borders?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it's still up to the national government.  Arizona is not trying to kick out anybody that the Federal government has not already said do not belong here.  And the Constitution provides -- even -- even with respect to the Commerce Clause --  ""No State shall without the consent of Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports or exports except.

""  The Constitution recognizes that there is such a thing as State borders and the States can police their borders, even to the point of inspecting incoming shipments to exclude diseased material.   Antonin Scalia  Do you have any example where -- where enforcement discretion has the effect of preempting state action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'll point out another case of ours where we've said that essentially the preemption of state law can occur, not by virtue of the Congress preempting, but because the Executive doesn't want this law enforced so -- so rigorously, and that preempts the state from enforcing it vigorously.  Do we have any cases--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, they do that with all Federal criminal statutes.  And you acknowledge that as a general matter, states can enforce Federal criminal law, which is always entrusted to the Attorney General.

I mean, it may have to do with racial harassment, but I thought you weren't relying on that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are you objecting to harassing the -- the people who have no business being here?  Is that -- surely you're not concerned about harassing them.  They have been stopped anyway, and all you're doing is calling up to see if they are illegal immigrants or not.  So you must be talking about other people who have nothing to do with -- with our immigration laws.  Okay?  Citizens and -- and other people, right?

Can it be made a state crime to rob those banks?  I think it is.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But does the Attorney General come in and say, you know, we might really only want to go after the professional bank robbers?  If it's just an amateur bank robber, you know, we're -- we're going the let it go.  And the state's interfering with our -- with our whole scheme here because it's prosecuting all these bank robbers.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, would anybody listen to that argument?   Antonin Scalia  Of course not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, maybe 1306(a) ought to be amended, then.  I mean, we have statutes out there that there a lot of people in violation of it and -- well, the Attorney General will take care of it.  Is that how we write our criminal laws?   Antonin Scalia  Again, I ask you, do you have any other case in which the basis for preemption has been you are interfering with the Attorney General's enforcement discretion?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think that's an extraordinary basis for saying that the state is preempted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not criminalizing anything that isn't criminal under Federal law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's the bank.  It's the Federal bank example--   Antonin Scalia  --a state law which criminalizes the same thing that the Federal law does.   Antonin Scalia  You said that in your brief, didn't you?

You're just saying this other statute does not permit it under our usual rules about waiver of sovereign immunity being strictly construed.  So, you know, it's a -- it's a -- it's a difference -- it's an odd sort of a specific governs the general argument.

And -- and you are saying that what constitutes a sale of a salesman cannot take account of the fact that this is a weird line of commerce, where you are selling to people who cannot make a commitment.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, excuse me.  Consignment salesmen are -- are not exempt?   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  How can they put in number 2?  I -- I thought that 3(k) is 3(k).  Can -- can they supplement 3(k)?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the authority to do that?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's wonderful.  Then if you can go beyond 3(k), I guess really the question before us is whether it's arbitrary or capricious for the agency not to extend their -- their -- their power to supplement 3(k) to this situation, which these people look like salesmen to me.  And so if they can do number 2 there, I don't know why -- why the agency couldn't say, oh, and by the way detailers are also included.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the issue would be whether it's unreasonable for them not to say that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure there is; sure there is.  But once you -- once you concede that it doesn't have to be within 3(k) and that it's within the power of the agency to grant the exemption anyway, then we -- we really have a different -- a different argument before us here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Didn't we have detailers in 1940?  Gee, that's a long time ago.  Did we have detailers in 1940?  That's almost a century ago.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But this is part of a regular program that the agency has now instituted, to run around the country and file amicus briefs; is that it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, right, to get -- instead of doing rulemaking, instead of doing adjudication, we're going to file amicus briefs, and the court will accept our view in that amicus brief and, hey, presto, we have made law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's extraordinary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There are 90,000 of these people, and you have not -- the agency has not brought any action for these, lo, these many years.  90,000 of them.  And all of a sudden you say -- you come in and say: Oh, you have been in violation of the law in the past, and you're going to have to pay a lot of money for all these people who you didn't give overtime to in the past.  I just think that's extraordinary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you have been guilty of malfeasance for 70 years, right?  These 90,000 people out there who have been in violation of the law and the agency has done not a blessed thing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't suggest -- you're not arguing for a rule that if -- if an individual does not seek an opinion letter, he's guilty?  Is that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, which is it?  I mean, you say, yes, yes, it's both.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Pick one.

I mean, I suppose your argument here is that there is harm, it's not just falsehood, but it's falsehood conjoined with harm, just as libel is.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So -- and in the example that Justice Ginsburg just gave, in your case there's harm to those courageous men and women who receive the decorations.  In the -- in the example that Justice Ginsburg gave, there's harm to the people who honorably served in the armed forces.   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't that just as--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Their service is demeaned when everybody says, I served in the armed forces.   Antonin Scalia  I don't see any difference as far as that risk goes.  I -- I hope that in your earlier colloquy with Justice Kennedy, you -- you were not retreating from what our cases have repeatedly said, that there is no First Amendment value in falsehood.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now this doesn't mean that every falsehood can be punished, because in -- in punishing some falsehoods you -- you risk deterring -- deterring truth.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I believe that there is no First Amendment value in -- in falsehood.   Antonin Scalia  I suppose that even in the commercial context we allow a decent amount of lying, don't we?  It's called puffing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Although -- although, you know, making false representations to sell a product is unlawful, we do allow puffing, don't we?   Antonin Scalia  You won't buy it cheaper anywhere else.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So maybe we allow a certain amount of puffing in political speech as well.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, sometimes the harm is just impairment of governmental purposes, such as section 1001, which criminalizes the making of a false statement to any Federal agent, for Pete's sake.  How do you justify that?  Because the making of the false statement impairs a governmental investigation.  And what is being urged here is that the making of this type of a false statement impairs the government's ability to honor valorous members of the armed forces.   Antonin Scalia  Do we give some deference to Congress as to whether there is a harm to governmental purposes or do we make it up ourselves?  When Congress passed this legislation, I assume it did so because it thought that the value of the awards that these courageous members of the armed forces were receiving was being demeaned and diminished.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  By charlatans.  That's what Congress thought.  Is that utterly unreasonable, that we can't accept it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The government is going to hire people to follow, you know -- is that realistic?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, there is a sanction.  You know when there is a sanction in place you think twice before you tell the lie.  But if there is no sanction except you might be exposed, who's going to expose you?  That sanction already exists, and there are a lot of people nonetheless who tell the lie.  You really expect the government to hire investigators to go around the country outing people who falsely claim military honors?  That's not going to happen.   Antonin Scalia  How about giving a Medal of Shame to those who have falsely claimed to have earned the Medal of Valor?  [Laughter]  I think that would be good.   Antonin Scalia  So a thing of value, it has to be something of commercial value, right?  Just to obtain praise and the higher esteem of your fellow citizens, that's -- that's not enough.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Miller, you -- you claim on behalf of the government that the decision of whether to take the land into trust has nothing to do with the use to which the land will be put; wherefore, these plaintiffs who are complaining about the use to which it'll be put have no standing.  If that is so, why did the government delay the taking into trust for three years while there was pending a lawsuit which would have prevented the use that the government intended the newly trusted land to be used for?  You delayed for three years because there was a challenge to whether you could use -- whether this land could be used for what you call gaming and I call gambling.  Why did you delay for three years if it's irrelevant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  On what basis?  On any basis other than--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, what environmental action consequences are there from the mere decision to take it into trust?  Unless you know what it's going to be used for, you have no idea what the environmental consequences are.   Antonin Scalia  But the challenge was to -- was to the transfer, you say.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Based in part on the use to which it was going to be put, right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why not?  Of course, it doesn't have to be within the interest, it just has to be arguably within the interest.  That -- that adverb is left out in much of the discussion.  But if, indeed, the use of the land is one of the elements to be considered in taking title, why isn't somebody who is affected by the proposed use within the zone of interest.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You could put that it way, or you could put it the injury comes from the government's taking title for gaming.  Okay?  You could put it that way as well.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Inasmuch as the government always has a purpose in mind when it takes title.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the Act provides for that.  The Act provides for that, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, is -- is that in the -- is that in the Administrative Procedure Act?  I thought the Administrative Procedure Act eliminates the -- the old bugaboo of sovereign immunity and says when it -- when it will stand and when it won't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And if you're relying on the Quiet Title Act, that -- that clearly covers only suits which seek to say, I own the land rather than the government, and this is not such a suit.  So I don't see why normal APA principles wouldn't govern.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, but the relief to be sought under the Quiet Title Act is title in the plaintiff.  That's the relief ultimately sought.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, on the way to that, you may -- you may get some injunctive remedy, but the basis for the lawsuit is -- is not: I own the land.   Antonin Scalia  Relief in that kind of suit, yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Relief in that kind of suit.  But this is not that kind of suit.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I guess I've lost you.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You can say that again and again, Counsel, but it does say ""under this section"".  And I don't -- I don't know how you get out from under that.  It says ""under this section"".   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And if this section applies only to suits seeking to assert title on the part of a plaintiff, it's not under this section.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought you were going to answer how his -- his complaint constructively changed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought you were going to tell us how it constructively changed to be an action seeking to have a decree that title was in him, which is what the QTA covers.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So even constructively, it hasn't turned into that.   Antonin Scalia  All right.  Do you have any concern that the government will get hoist by its own petard?  What your argument -- the conclusion to which your argument leads is that this individual or any individual claiming that the government took title incorrectly can sue under the Quiet Title Act, even if they don't claim that title was taken from them.  Are you sure that's good for the government?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, that's not the only time the government takes land, right?   ",11-246X

Antonin Scalia  Surely -- surely the 30-day envisions comments by anybody, not just people who claim to own the property, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  I thought that -- maybe I'm wrong, but the government will correct me if I am.  I thought the government concedes that a NEPA action could -- could be brought when the government is taking land to use for a particular use.  Let's say it's -- it's taking land for a nuclear waste repository.  Certainly a NEPA action would -- would lie.  You don't disagree with that, do you.   Antonin Scalia  You're supposed to say, yes, sir, good.

You're not asserting that the action can be brought anytime within six years after the government has already taken the land.  You're just asserting that an action brought before the government takes the land does not change its character and become a quiet title action afterwards; right.   Antonin Scalia  You're not saying that anybody can bring within six years after the government's taking a suit, are you?  I hope you're not arguing that.   Antonin Scalia  Thank you.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I think you're right.  I pushed you into it.  It's my fault.  You're right.   Antonin Scalia  Of course the government can fix that.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I do not see how this court -- how the -- how the court of appeals is going to be able to do anything different other than say there's no liability here, unless, of course, it adopts another fanciful interpretation of the statute, which is something I worry about.

Antonin Scalia  Well, is it--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, is it just a question of our creating a new rule; or, rather, is the proposition whether the tribes, when they entered into this, should have realized that because of the peculiarity of these contracts, that they had to be entered into, that the rule which otherwise would apply does not apply?  It ought to be a question of expectation of the tribe, should it not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you think it protects these -- these unsophisticated tribes who don't know enough to sue by not allowing anybody to sue?

But the statute doesn't say that.  It says apply agency principles.  How does agency have anything to do with the line you're arguing that we take here?

As I understand the law, the police are entitled to use binoculars to look into the house if -- if the residents leave the blinds open, right?   Antonin Scalia  But if they can't see clearly enough from a distance, they're not entitled to go onto the curtilage of the house, inside the gate, and use the binoculars from that vantage point, are they?   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't it the same thing with the dog?  This dog was brought right up -- right up to the -- to the door of the house.   Antonin Scalia  Well, then we've taken an unrealistic case, if that has been conceded, because it seems to me crucial that this officer went onto the portion of the house that -- as to which there is privacy, and -- and used a means of -- of discerning what was in the house that -- that should not have been available--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in that space.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Police officers can come there to knock on the door, but I thought you've conceded that police officers can't come there to look into the house with binoculars, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When the purpose of the officer's going there is to -- is to conduct a search, it's not permitted.   Antonin Scalia  It isn't just the sniffing in the abstract.  It's the sniffing at this point, the sniffing at a person's front door, right?  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, I didn't say it wouldn't be a search if the police officer himself did that if he went there with the intention of -- of smelling at the door.  He's going there to search, and he shouldn't be on the curtilage to search.   ",11-564X

And he foolishly and mistakenly leaves the blinds open in the room where -- where the corpse is lying, and the policeman at a great distance has a telescope and he looks through the blinds and he sees the corpse.  Can the police go into the home?   Antonin Scalia  Oh -- he hasn't knowingly.  He was careless.   Antonin Scalia  He certainly wanted to keep it -- he wanted to keep it private.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you could say the same thing here.  They wanted to keep private the fact that they were growing the marijuana, but they -- they used a means of suppressing the heat that made it impossible to keep it private.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They were careless.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There were the mothballs.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But, Mr. Blumberg, I think you're, with respect, misguided to concede that if it was just the officer alone without the dog, it would be perfectly okay.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I thought you did.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I would assume you would say that if the officer walks up there with no intention to knock and talk, but just walks up to the door with the intention of sniffing at the door, you would consider that to be a violation, wouldn't you?   Antonin Scalia  All right.  Again, I think you're wrong not to accept that.  I think our cases support it.  I think you cannot enter the protected portion of a home, which is called the curtilage, with the intention of conducting a search, that that is not permitted.  I think our cases establish that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it's fine to say -- I don't think it's true that the intent of the officer is never relevant.  It is relevant in that context.  The reason for the officer going onto protected property, if he's going on just to knock on the door to sell tickets to the Policeman's Ball, that's fine.  If he's going on to conduct a search, that's something else.   Antonin Scalia  But you do say that this is an easier case.   Antonin Scalia  It's not the sidewalk here, is it?

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In other words, was Sanguinetti expressing a special rule for flooding, or was it -- was it simply saying there can't be a temporary taking?  If the latter, that dictum if it's dictum or a holding if it was a holding has already been overruled by our later temporary takings cases.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We have cases about flying over land--   Antonin Scalia  --cases about shooting -- shooting over lands.  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not water, but it ain't taking, either, in the -- in the narrow sense that Justice Breyer has talked about.   Antonin Scalia  What if it hadn't harmed the timber?  I mean, you know, the damages claimed are a lot -- a lot of the timber that would have been valuable was -- was impaired by these floodings.  Suppose that did no harm at all?  Suppose it had just been for a certain period of time you were not able to use that land for anything?  You couldn't plant anything on it.  You couldn't picnic on it.  You couldn't do anything.  Would that have been -- nonetheless, despite the fact that there -- there was no harm done except -- except the flooding -- would that have been a taking?   Antonin Scalia  Well, he has.  It's flooded.  He can't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --It does.  He can't plow on it.  He can't picnic on it.  How does that not interfere with his--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --So it would be a taking.  Are you saying yes or no?  What is it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So our cases -- our cases treat physical occupations differently from other -- from other cases, don't they?  The park ranger walking through can hardly be called a physical occupation.  He's on the land, but it's not a physical occupation.  What you're -- what you're arguing here is that -- is that flooding the land is a physical occupation for the period that it's flooded.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but what you say -- here's what troubles me.  You say it has to be substantial.  But you -- can we -- can we fold into that word substantial a requirement that it have caused substantial financial loss?  See, if that were the case, then -- then I could distinguish your case where a lot of valuable trees got destroyed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I wouldn't say every -- you know, every flood that goes across a land, even two years or three years in a row, would not necessarily be a taking.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I didn't think you were saying that.   Antonin Scalia  A foreseeable and certain incidental consequence.   Antonin Scalia  Well, no, not necessarily.  Suppose there -- because of a spring melt-off or other factors, it's clear that the reservoir for several months of the year will be more extensive than it will the rest of the year.   Antonin Scalia  So you could say, just -- just as here, that there's only been a temporary taking of some of the land behind the reservoir.  Now, doesn't the -- doesn't the government condemn all the land--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --even that which would be only temporarily flooded?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, that can't overrule the Takings Clause, can it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, that's nice that Congress doesn't want to be liable.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the issue is who is going to pay for the wonderful benefit to these farmers.  Should it be everybody, so that the government pays, and all of us pay through taxes, or should it be this -- this particular sorry landowner who happens to lose all his trees?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That doesn't seem to me particularly fair.

So he makes an appointment with the commissioner, police commissioner, and he goes in and grouses about his wages.  He does this, you know, 10 or 11 times.  And the commissioner finally is fed up and tells his secretary, I don't -- I don't want to see this man again.  Has he violated the Constitution?

It's still not a matter of public concern?  Does it have to be the whole police force?   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me it's always a matter of public concern, whether you're going to raise the salaries of policemen, whether it's an individual policeman asking for that or -- or a -- a combination of policemen or a union.  It's a always a matter of public concern, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  To not -- not give this guy an appointment for the 12th time.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, how can he shut his door if he has a right to petition, a constitutional right to petition for the redress of grievances?  His grievance is he's not being paid enough.   Antonin Scalia  But it's the same grievance if the union had presented it.  The -- the grievance is the salaries for policemen are not high enough.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He's not asking for just his salary to be raised.  He wants salaries of all -- all the cops to be raised.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Messenger, just to clarify what was the purpose of my earlier line of questioning, it was simply to show that if you have a case it doesn't rest on the right to petition the government for redress of grievances.  It -- it rests on the First Amendment.  You -- you say that there is being -- your -- your people are being required to support speech that they don't agree with.   Antonin Scalia  Now, that is, you know, that is an arguable position, but I don't -- I don't think it's even arguable that the right to petition the government for redress of grievances is -- is involved here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a First Amendment violation, not a violation -- not a denial of the right to petition the government.   Antonin Scalia  What -- what was the question?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I want to hear the answer, too, because, contrary to what Justice Kagan suggests, I -- I didn't say your First Amendment argument was valid.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I said at least it was a comprehensible argument.   Antonin Scalia  Why isn't it?  I mean, it is for private employers.  There are some private employers who think they're better off with a closed shop and they just want to deal with one union and -- and they require all the people that they hire to become a member of this union and to pay union dues for representational purposes.  They do this as private employers because they think it is in their interest as an employer.  Why can't the government have the same interest?   Antonin Scalia  All right.  But -- but don't tell me that there's no employer interest.  There is an employer interest.  You're just saying it is not -- it is not considerable enough, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I suppose -- I suppose the fact that you're entitled to speak against abortion would not justify the government in requiring you to give money to Planned Parenthood?   Antonin Scalia  That's the argument you're making.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Those things you can argue are not part of the representation for which they should be charged and they should get their money back for those things if they're actually not -- not getting any benefit from them.   Antonin Scalia  No, but they're -- I mean, what our cases say is you -- you can be compelled not to be a free rider, to -- to pay for those items of bargaining that benefit you as well as everybody else.  But you don't -- you don't have to pay for stuff that -- that is not within that description, stuff that doesn't benefit you at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, one can be skeptical about whether, when States do this they are doing it because it's more -- more efficient as an employer, because some States have tried to force private employers to have a closed shop, haven't they?   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Well, I think--   Antonin Scalia  And there's no, you know, no State government interest in it.  There's just State interest in unions.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --Yes, but here we argue--   Antonin Scalia  And unions getting a lot of money from people who don't belong in the unions.  So one can be skeptical about whether this is really what's going on, that the State really thinks it's going to be a lot easier if it has a closed shop.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  --I guess what I would say about that, Justice Scalia, is that one could speculate about motives of States like Illinois, one could speculate about motives of the right to work States, but I would suggest that under our Federal system that States get to make those kinds of policy choices.  And Illinois has made a policy choice, as many private employers have, that using collective bargaining -- and it is, I want to stress here, very narrowly tailored collective bargaining.  By law, it can only be over wages, hours, and conditions of employment, by law.   Antonin Scalia  They may do so because of that reason.  You don't know what their reason is any more than I do.  All you can say is that that might be their reason.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  And they ought to have the discretion to make that choice under this Court's case law.  That's our position with respect to that.  If I could make a point that I think is an important point about the free rider rationale under Abood.  There's been some suggestion that the point of the free rider rationale is to -- is to force the dissenters, the nonunion members to pay up.  I don't think that's the right way to understand the free rider point.  That once the State has imposed a duty of fair representation, then everybody's got an incentive to free ride, whether you're a union supporter or not, because by operation of law, you're going to get the benefit.  It's just a classic logic of collective action problem.  And so the -- the fair share requirement really is content neutral in that it's -- it's designed to ensure that the union has the funds it needs to carry out the responsibilities that the State wants it to carry out and that that could be jeopardized by supporters as well as dissidents, deciding that they -- that they don't want to pay because they don't have to, because the law would get them the benefit of the duty of fair representation even if they didn't.  Now, with respect to the question of -- of whether Abood should be overruled, I would suggest to the Court that it's got a very powerful stare decisis effect behind it.  Abood's not exactly an outlier.  It was reaffirmed in Lehnert, in Ellis.  It was reaffirmed just in 2009 unanimously in the Locke case.  As Justice Breyer indicated, there is very substantial reliance, and contractual reliance throughout the country on the constitutionality of Abood.  And as I -- I said, I think the most important point here is that the line the Court drew in Abood and the line that has stood for 40 years is entirely consistent with the Court's First Amendment jurisprudence in the context of government as employer, not as regulator of sovereign.  Of course, if the government was acting as sovereign regulating the citizenry, an obligation of this kind would trigger the most exacting scrutiny.   Antonin Scalia  But -- but it's only people who -- who disagree with the -- what the union's doing who could refuse to pay, you say?  Right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why can't people who -- who agree with the union just say, hey, I don't -- I don't have to pay.  The union is going to do this stuff anyway.  I'm going to ride for free.  These other people are riding for free.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is there any -- is there any way to decide who's doing it just to save money and who's doing it on principle?   Antonin Scalia  So -- so you're essentially destroying not just the -- not just the -- the -- closed shop, but you're destroying the ability of the union to -- to get money even from the people who don't agree with what it's doing.

Is -- is that not the case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not just discretion.  It's political discretion.  That's what's troublesome about it.  It seems to me the government takes an absolutist approach to the proposition that you cannot use an unprecleared plan for any purpose.  All the law says is that you cannot apply a precleared plan.  The plan being applied here is not the Texas legislature's plan; it's the plan -- a remedial plan adopted by Federal judges.  And to say that they cannot use in drawing up that plan the legislature's last political decisions seems to me not required by the mere prohibition against implementing that plan as the plan of the legislature.  What would you do if -- if the district court in Washington and the district court in Texas, neither one of them acts in time, and it's too late?  It's too late to have any -- any primaries anymore?

You disenfranchise every voter in Texas--   Sri Srinivasan  --No, I don't think you should do that.   Antonin Scalia  --because there may be some voters in Texas, may be, some who will be prejudiced by using the current plan?  I suggest in that situation there is nothing to do but use the Texas plan.   Sri Srinivasan  Well, I don't -- not in the context of section 5, Your Honor.  That's one option, but the other option would be to use a malapportioned plan, which this Court has suggested would be something the courts could do.  Now, that is not a preferred option, to be sure.  But we are not in that situation here, because what you have is interim maps that have been developed.  We are not in the kind of emergency situation that you are positing.   Antonin Scalia  You acknowledge that there are some situations in which you can use the very plan that the Texas legislature adopted, even though it's not been precleared?   Sri Srinivasan  Only if there is no time for the district court to adopt a different plan.  But if--   Antonin Scalia  So it's no longer an absolute rule.  So the question is whether this is another reasonable exception to a non-absolute rule.   Sri Srinivasan  --There is an emergency exception, as there is with all sorts of legal rules.  But that's so far as we would go.  Now, I would like to address the proposition that suggestions what the Court would be doing here under Texas's view is just a standard application of substantial likelihood of success principles, because it's not.  It's decidedly different from standard operation of substantial likelihood of success principles in three fundamental respects.  The first goes to the burden, Justice Kennedy, and I think you alluded to this in your question.  The burden in a preliminary injunction context stays with the same party at the preliminary injunction stage as at the merits stage.  And so when in a preliminary injunction context the court is asking, has there been a substantial likelihood of success on the merits, the same party has to make that showing as has to make that showing at the merits stage.

Antonin Scalia  That's a pretty horrible result, but let me give you another horrible result, and that is if -- if we agree with you, farmers will not be able to do a second planting by simply getting the undifferentiated seeds from a grain elevator, because at least a few of those seeds will always be patented seeds, and no farmer could ever plant anything from a grain elevator, which means -- I gather they use it for second plantings where the risks are so high that it doesn't pay to buy expensive seed.  Now they can't do that any more because there's practically no grain elevator that doesn't have at least one patented seed in it.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  --And the answer to that is this is actually not a traditional farming practice.  Despite what Petitioner says, farmers do not generally go to grain elevators, buy commingled grain, plant it in the ground as seed.  If you look at the American Soybean Association brief submitted on behalf of soybean farmers, it says as much.  If you look at the CHS brief which is submitted on behalf of grain elevators, it also explains that.  And there is a number of reasons why that is the case.  There's the reasons that Petitioner talked about, which is that they an undifferentiated mix, but there are other reasons as well.  The business of grain elevators is not to sell commingled grain as seed.  If that was their business they would have to comply with seed labeling laws.  They do not do so because it's not their business model.   Antonin Scalia  That's why it's so cheap.  And that's why farmers -- and that's why farmers want to use it, for a cheap planting.   Melissa Arbus Sherry  But farmers wouldn't be able to use it for another reason as well.  Even if you take patent law and you put it entirely to the side, there is still the Plant Variety Protection Act.   Antonin Scalia  Do you agree that it's unlawful for grain elevators to sell it for replanting?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but -- but that's -- nothing prevents him from planting it.  What he is prevented from doing is using the -- the consequences of that planting, the second generation seeds, for another planting.  That's all he is prevented from doing.  He can plant and harvest and eat or sell.  He just can't plant, harvest, and then replant.   INTERRUPTING ",11-796X

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  There are exceptions to the preemption and that is not one of them.  And other statutes do have exceptions for -- for commercial operations or private operations.  This one doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do market participants impose civil and criminal penalties?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ah.  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Is that how we decide these things?  When there is on the books a criminal penalty that can apply to everybody, do we let the State come in and say: Oh, you know, no harm, no foul because it's on the books but we -- we don't really use it.  Well, I don't know -- I don't know that we do that.  If it's there, it's a criminal penalty, and if -- if the condition of -- of -- of you're being able to impose these limitations is that you not have criminal penalties, there is a criminal penalty.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure that's crucial.  You think a state can say nobody's going to come on our highways until it signs a contract?  Okay?  These highways belong to us, they are State land, and anybody who wants to ride on the highways, you have to enter a contract with the State.  And that's going to get around this Federal statute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  It's a highway only for trucks.  It's a truck highway.  Okay?  It's specially reinforced and everything, but you have to enter a contract with the State in order to drive your truck on this highway.  And that's okay?   Antonin Scalia  I know we're not.  That's why it's a hypothetical.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  The State makes money on this truck highway.  It's a money-maker, okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And that makes it okay?   Antonin Scalia  It was implied preemption in Boston Harbor.  Here you have an express preemption clause which contains exceptions, and among those exceptions is not the running of a commercial enterprise, even though that is made an exception in a number of other Federal statutes, Federal preemption statutes.  That's a very high hill for you to climb, relying solely on the fact that you are a commercial enterprise.   Antonin Scalia  What -- what if they violate those conditions?

Then do you exclude only the truck that violates it, or do you exclude the whole trucking company?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the ultimate?

Antonin Scalia  I mean, you acquire probable cause, you go in and there's nothing there.  You've wasted the time of your police officers, you've wasted a lot of time.   Antonin Scalia  Well, maybe the police department doesn't care about that, but it certainly cares about wasting the time of its police officers in fruitless searches.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Willy-nilly.  Officers just like to search.  They don't particularly want to search where they're likely to find something.  They just like to search.  So let's get dogs that, you know, smell drugs when there are no drugs.  You really think that that's what's going on here?   Antonin Scalia  They like to search where they're likely to find something, and that only exists when the dog is well trained.  It seems to me they have every incentive to train the dog well.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, I assure you that if we agree with you there will be a whole body of experts that will spring into being about dog training.  I assure you that that will be the case.   Antonin Scalia  But, counsel, you're defending a Florida supreme court opinion which says “ must ”.  You can't just say, you know, I'm not asserting any particular thing is necessary, just, you know, totality of the circumstances.

It has nothing to do with the -- the commanding officer saying this is the only part of the installation that we care about.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It marks the end of the easement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So we're back to the real estate test.  I -- I thought that you were not relying on the -- on the exclusive ownership test.  You are?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're defending the Ninth Circuit's?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  What about the portion of the base on the other side of the road easement, where the government does have exclusive possession?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that okay?  That's still part of the base.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes or no, under your theory?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That may be very bad, but is it bad because the government does not have exclusive possession of every--   Antonin Scalia  --You know, when you talk about the road, they've given an easement, so you can say, oh, yeah, they don't have exclusive possession.  But the other side of the road, that vast tract, you are saying the government, what, does or does not have exclusive possession?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Then the word “ possession ” means nothing.  You are -- you are applying solely a functional test.  It only possesses that which it is using for military purposes.  That is not a possession test.  It's a purely functional test.   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me a First Amendment argument and not an argument that goes to the scope of Section 1382.   Antonin Scalia  So you are saying we should read the statute to say it only applies when it doesn't violate the First Amendment.  Of course we'd read it that way.   Antonin Scalia  But not because it has anything to do with the scope of authority of the government.  It's what the government can do.  I -- I don't know how to read that, that text, in such a way that it will avoid all First Amendment problems.  There is no way to do that.   ",12-1038

0,"Antonin Scalia  But -- but you could say that about any declaratory judgment action.  You can say the person bringing the declaratory judgment action is seeking the relief.  And if -- if we follow what you said, that then the burden shifts in every declaratory judgment action.  And it clearly doesn't.  I mean, we -- we've said time and again that the burden of proof normally does not shift.  What's different here?   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me it is often the case in declaratory judgment actions that the defendant in the action cannot counterclaim.  I mean, it typically occurs when somebody doesn't want to be in breach of contract and -- and brings a suit to see, you know, claiming if I do this I won't be in breach.  The other side can't counterclaim because the person hasn't been in breach.  The whole purpose of the declaratory judgment statute is to enable you to sue before the other side has a cause of action against you.  That's the whole purpose of it.  So -- so why should the fact that the other side doesn't have a counterclaim change anything?  That's usually the situation.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But we are not dealing with the normal default rule.  We are dealing with a declaratory judgment statute, and we've said time and time again that it doesn't alter the burden of proof.  And your response is: Well, it does when the other side can't counterclaim.  And my response to that is: Usually the other side can't counterclaim.   Antonin Scalia  Then the Declaratory Judgment Act doesn't change it; that's your position?  What do you do about the res judicata problem?  Let's assume that we put the burden of proof where you want it.  Okay?  So this declaratory judgment action is defeated.  All right?  Nonetheless, they say: Still and all, we are going to go ahead and not pay any royalties.  And then you bring -- you bring an infringement action, right?   Antonin Scalia  Is -- is the prior decision res judicata or are you going to have to relitigate the whole thing, but this time with the burden of proof on you?   Antonin Scalia  Why not?  You never -- you never established that you're entitled to any -- any infringement damages.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, you -- you would normally have the burden as -- as the person claiming infringement.   Antonin Scalia  Of course.   Antonin Scalia  Right?  So you'll have to relitigate the whole thing because you -- you never established that there was infringement.  In the declaratory judgment action, all you've established is that they didn't prove non-infringement.   Antonin Scalia  So we have to relitigate the whole thing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the alternative?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's my hypothetical, okay?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So your answer is, Justice Scalia, you're right, but it doesn't matter very much.  That's your answer, right?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  The Declaratory Judgment Act is addressed to potential coercion, not actual coercion.  That's the whole point.  You should be able to bring the suit before coercion is applied.  Now, it is true that you're not applying coercion right now, but what they're worried about is if they stop paying the royalties, you will apply coercion and the Declaratory Judgment Act is a way of getting this on the table before a court without their having to go into default and incurring all the penalties, but it is not intended to shift the burden of proof.   Antonin Scalia  It does shift the burden of proof because if what they are worried about is your claiming infringement and exacting a penalty from them for their not paying the royalties that the agreement provides, okay?  That's what they are worried about.  The Declaratory Judgment Act enables them to sue beforehand, before they incur liability.  That's its whole purpose, and its purpose is not to shift the burden of proof.   Antonin Scalia  You can always say that in declaratory judgment actions: That is not the situation we face.  The Declaratory Judgment Act posits a hypothetical situation.  It always does.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I am worried that you are going to sue me later.  You are not suing me now.  That's not the situation I face.  But I worry that you will sue me later.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They don't want to -- they don't want to continue to pay royalties.  That's the point.  That's why they bring the Declaratory Judgment Act, so that the court can tell them: You don't have to pay royalties because this stuff is not covered.   INTERRUPTING ",12-1128

Antonin Scalia  So there have been laws against obstruction during this entire period, right?   Antonin Scalia  And you say that only once, in 1997, that was the last time a prosecution was brought.

Antonin Scalia  What's the alternative here?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --The alternative--   Antonin Scalia  Standing 35 feet away and yelling?   Ian H. Gershengorn  --No, Your Honor.   Antonin Scalia  Is that the alternative?   Ian H. Gershengorn  No, Your Honor.   Antonin Scalia  To comfort these women?   Ian H. Gershengorn  No, Your Honor.  The alternative in this case is the entire length of the sidewalk, quiet counseling, leafletting, and conversation is permitted.  It is the last four to five seconds before the petition -- before the counselors enter the clinic that--   Antonin Scalia  They don't know who's going into the clinic.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --Your Honor, the testimony--   Antonin Scalia  Until you get to the area close to the clinic, you don't know whether passersby are going there or not.   Ian H. Gershengorn  --Your Honor, the testimony is actually to the contrary, that they get -- that Ms. McCullen and others get quite good at identifying who is going and is not going into the clinic.

1,"Antonin Scalia  This is not a protest case.  These people don't want to protest abortion.  They want to talk to the women who are about to get abortions and try to talk them out of it.  I -- I think it -- it distorts it to say that what they want to do is protest abortion.  If it was a protest, keeping them back 35 feet might not be so bad.  They can scream and yell and hold up signs from 35 feet.  But what they can't do is try to talk the woman out of the abortion.  It's a counseling case, not a -- not a protest case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, surely you could have a law against screaming and shouting within 35 feet or protesting within 35 feet.  Isn't that more narrowly tailored?  I mean, what this case involves, what these people want to do is to speak quietly and in a friendly manner, not in a hostile manner, because that would -- that would frustrate their purpose, with the people going into the clinic.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You should say yes.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand it.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Counsel, you are not reading this, are you?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, that's nice.  Do you know of any other real estate thing which says it's an easement for one purpose and the fee for another?  The government absolutely denied in Great Northern, didn't it?  It was -- that was the government's case; this was not a fee.   Antonin Scalia  They didn't say it's a -- you know, for some purposes it is.  They said it was not a fee.  And that's what the Court held, contrary -- in accordance with what the government wanted, right?   Antonin Scalia  And that case has been around for how long?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  And the case explicitly says it's an easement.  And people have been buying and selling real estate I assume in reliance on that case for -- for that entire period of time.  And now the government has this new theory that for some purposes it's a fee; for some purposes it's an easement.  That's not what Great Northern said.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I assume your answer would be that if it's a choice between disappointing people who properly relied on the law, and disappointing people who were -- were not following the law, it's clear who should -- who should take it in the neck.  It's the latter, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand how that can be, and yet, the government can argue contrary to what the government says.  I mean, is that what you are telling us?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The Interior says one thing and the Justice Department here says something else?  I mean, we have a president who reconciles these two things.  He must agree with one or the other.   Antonin Scalia  I'm sure the government will have an explanation as to why we shouldn't.   ",12-1173
0,"Antonin Scalia  Wait, wait.  Before you go, you really think the Court was saying, It will be an easement when that suits the government, but it will be something else when that suits the government?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's either an easement or it's not an easement.  You really think the -- the opinion meant to reserve the question whether it was an easement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Did they give compensation to the people--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --to whom they pronounced that?   Antonin Scalia  That can't change the meaning of the 1875 Act.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It reflects a later Congress's understanding of what an earlier Congress did.  We don't--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --interpret statutes on the basis of what later Congresses think they meant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  People have done it.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Of course, those -- those savings would -- would not be evenly distributed among the upwind States, right?  So some upwind States that are able to make those efficient changes will be carrying more than their burden of reducing the emissions that affect downwind States, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't mind a State doing less.  I think North Carolina said -- said that you can use those cost figures to do less, and that's not challenged here.  But what the application of the cost factor means is that some States that can more efficiently make the changes will be required to do more than merely account for their proportion of the downwind harm.  Isn't that true?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes or no?  I mean, I think it's an easy yes or no answer.   Antonin Scalia  Have you answered my question?  Does -- does -- does the fact that you begin with what the statute says is each upwind State has to account for its -- its effect on the downwind States, but once having identified that effect, you -- you then say those upwind States that can make the reductions more efficiently have to make more reductions than they -- than their mere proportion of the harm requires.  Isn't that so?   Antonin Scalia  And what provision of the statute allows you to take that into account?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, as opposed to each State, whether it's inefficient or efficient, has to merely reduce its contribution to the downwind State pollution; right?  That's what the statute says.   Antonin Scalia  The problem is that that allocation among different actors is done State by State, and simply taking costs into account as determining who will do what simply eliminates the requirement that each State not be -- not be required to do more than its share of the pollution it's -- it's causing downstream.  It's the State-by-State requirement that makes it very difficult to think that all Congress wanted was the most efficient reduction of pollution no matter where that pollution came from.  That's simply not what the statute envisions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And maybe that'd be a better statute.  Maybe it shouldn't be State by State.   Antonin Scalia  If Congress wanted that, why couldn't Congress simply have said the EPA shall prescribe minimum pollution reduction measures that have to be taken by the States?  That's a quite different statute from what we have before us.  But what you're saying is, you know, you -- you reduce it this -- this much, as much as efficiency will allow, or else you're in violation of -- of the good neighbor rule.  And that's a very different statute from what Congress wrote.  Maybe it's a good idea.  Maybe EPA ought to control all -- all efficiency measures for reducing pollution, but it's certainly not the statute that Congress wrote.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I don't understand that.  Please say that again.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, but that's crucial.  I mean, it would have no idea whether EPA would use any or would pick $500 or would pick whatever.  I mean, I don't know how it could sensibly design a -- a program without knowing that.   Antonin Scalia  Can you give us an example of when EPA has done this in the past, where a -- a crucial element of a -- of a NAAQS has not been defined by the agency and yet the agency nonetheless requires the States to -- to put together their SIPs without knowing what their target is?  And that's the problem here.  What's your best example of another case in which the agency said, you -- you put together a SIP and we're not going to tell you what the target is?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that just means it's pin the tail on the donkey.  Some States got the tail.  I mean, you know, they pinned it in the right place.  That doesn't prove anything.  I want an example of another instance in which EPA has -- has hidden the ball, has said, we're not going to tell you what the target is; it's up to you to come up -- up with a SIP and we'll tell you after the fact whether that SIP happened to meet the target that we've invented.   Antonin Scalia  All right.  Correct.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.  That just means there's some facts that they don't know.  Of course.  There is always going to be uncertainty about certain facts.  But here there is uncertainty about the target, not just about the facts.  We don't know what target we're expected to hit.   Antonin Scalia  I suppose you could average them out, couldn't you?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think that's any more irrational then picking a number like 500 bucks as -- as to, you know, what the -- who can do it more efficiently.  That's sort of arbitrary.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that, but my point is that is certainly a pretty -- pretty arbitrary number, and -- and I think averaging for all the receptors is certainly no more arbitrary.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Can I ask, until you propose your SIP to replace the FIP, right, the FIP remains in effect?   Antonin Scalia  And you're bound by that until they approve your new SIP.

I mean as soon as--   Antonin Scalia  --If you'll have to develop a new SIP, that'll take you some time?   Antonin Scalia  And then that SIP is -- is submitted to EPA, and -- and they chew on it for as long as they want, right?   Antonin Scalia  And then maybe they will say your SIP is good enough, and maybe they won't.   Antonin Scalia  And that means the statute doesn't require you to do that, I assume.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, when they say that, that -- that's an affirmation by them that the statute does not require you to do it, I assume.  Is that your point?   Antonin Scalia  Well, they have done the impossible here, haven't they?  I mean, they have the transport rule.  That's -- the only question is whether it should have come out sooner or later, right?  The only question is whether it should have come out before the States were obliged to submit their SIPs.   Antonin Scalia  You started to give us a second statutory reason.  I was really eager to see what that was.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Would you finish describing the issue?  I really didn't hear it.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think -- it think it would follow that if you did it for good cause to -- to apply the rule, you can do it for good cause to abolish it.  Not that you can do it by rulemaking when you adopt it and then used good cause when you -- when you abolish it.  It would seem to me to square with the text.   Antonin Scalia  In the same manner?

Antonin Scalia  Okay.  I understand.  Well, all right.  What -- what must be added to the word ""meritless""?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That no -- no reasonable judge could have found it to be with merit?

Unreasonably weak?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You've got to give me something tighter than that.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand your answer to the question.  How does the first part of the Federal Circuit's test differ from your perception of what meritless means?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Telscher, it occurs to me that you really cannot answer the question of what adjectives should be attached to ""meritless"".  And the reason you can't is, since it is a totality of the circumstances test, that is only one factor and it doesn't have to be an absolute degree of meritlessness.  Even in a -- I assume you would say that even in a very close case, if there has been outrageous litigation abuse by the other side, the court would be able to say: My goodness, I've never seen lawyers behave like this.  You're going to pay the attorneys' fees for the other side.  Couldn't the court do that?   Antonin Scalia  So then how can we possibly define ""meritless""?  We can't, because it goes up and down, even in a case where it's a close case.  It could still be exceptional.   Antonin Scalia  Now matter What other factors exist?  It has to be objectively unreasonable.  I mean, even if it is clear from other factors that this is a shakedown, a big country -- a big company trying to suppress a little company, even if it's clear that there has been outrageous litigation abuse, misconduct by attorneys?   Roman Martinez  --It is an important point, Justice Scalia.   Antonin Scalia  All of those things cannot justify shifting the award unless it is objectively unreasonable.   Roman Martinez  No, Justice Scalia, that's not our position.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay.  Our position is if the only factor is an objectively unreasonable argument, that in appropriate circumstances that could be sufficient.  We believe very, very strongly that if there are other factors present that would only strengthen the case for appeal.   Antonin Scalia  You want to add ""et cetera"", right?   Roman Martinez  --And add ""or similar"", ""similar equitable"", ""similar and inequitable conduct"", which is what the Ninth Circuit said in the Park-in-Theaters case, which I think all the parties agree fairly captures what Congress intended to incorporate from the cases decided in the late Forties.   Antonin Scalia  But it's in the Senate report, so--  [Laughter]   Roman Martinez  Justice Kagan, we think that the way to look at the statute is to try to figure out what Congress understood the statute to mean in 1952.  And it's very clear and I think both sides agree that Congress intended to essentially incorporate the -- the thrust of the judicial opinions that had been issued under the 1946 statute.  Those opinions repeatedly talked about gross injustice, drawing from the prior legislative history, and when they awarded fees and when they discussed when fees would be appropriate, the circumstances that we list in our brief are what they said would equate to gross injustice.  So I think in the abstract you may be right that gross injustice is a broader standard or maybe it's a little bit -- you know, only the most exceptional of exceptional cases would be covered.  But in practice what Congress was looking at and what they were responding to and what they were intending to put in this statute was an idea of gross injustice that reflected those bad faith, harassing, and unreasonable situations.   Antonin Scalia  So if that's what you mean, why don't you say ""exceptional injustice"" instead of ""gross injustice""?   Roman Martinez  We're trying to tie the interpretation of the statute to the language--   Antonin Scalia  To the Senate report.   Roman Martinez  --Not just to the Senate report, Justice Scalia, but to the judicial decisions.  And this Court has often looked to judicial decisions -- judicial decisions as a backdrop against which Congress legislates.   ",12-1184

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So the two of you are in agreement it ought to go back to the Ninth Circuit, they should do it on the merits, and -- and if that's wrong, we can review that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That may well be, but--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, but part of that penalty was, you know, your raisins or your life, right?  I mean, it was--  [Laughter]  --you don't have to pay the penalty if you give us the raisins.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You mean they -- Is that right, they have to give the raisins?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that amounts to the same thing, your raisins or the penalty, right?   Antonin Scalia  That couldn't be what the statute meant.  I think that's what Justice Breyer says.  Did -- did Congress create a statute in which we're going to take your raisins and then you can go to the Court of Claims and get your money back.  I mean, that -- that surely is not what Congress contemplated.  The -- the whole notion of the program is you can't get your money back in the Court of Claims.  Now, if you're raising a constitutional objection, that's something else.  That should be done in district court.  But to say that Congress contemplated, you know, we'll take your raisins and then you sue in the Court of Claims, they give you your money back.  That's a weird statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you -- you think that's a close question?  You think that the way the statute is supposed to operate, once it is held that this is an unconstitutional taking, is that every year, the government takes the raisins and every year, the grower goes to the Court of Claims and gets the money back for the raisins.  Is that the program that Congress anticipated?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think it's close at all.  That's a crazy statute.  Every year we're going to take raisins and every year we're going to pay you in the Court of Claims.  What's the purpose of that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's a merits question again.  I mean, it's not a question of whether you -- you can resist on the basis of a takings claim.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Let's -- Let's take your second point.  What a statute of limitations says is not that you are -- are scot-free within the statute of limitations period.  It simply is a negative.  It says you can't be sued beyond that, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So it seems to me there is nothing -- if -- if we adopted the position of the other side, there's nothing that would cause the statute of limitations to be frustrated.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but it continued to be used in equity, even when there were limitations period, didn't it.  It may have started that way, but that was certainly not its only use.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it was Federal law.  Federal law adopted it.  It was Federal law.   Antonin Scalia  But they originated in equity, just as laches did.  The tolling rules originated in equity.  They were brought into law.  What troubles me about this case is this: Did the adoption of the new Rules of Federal Procedure disable courts from bringing over anything else from equity into law?  Tolling used to exist.  It was brought over into law before the new Rules of Civil Procedure.  And therefore, you would not be altering any substantive right to continue to apply that tolling rule.  Your argument here is -- is that to apply laches is to alter a substantive right, and, therefore, under the -- under the Rules Enabling Act is not allowable.  My question is this: Do you think that the Rules Enabling Act prevented courts from doing what they had in the past?  That is, not using the Act as the means of saying everything that was in equity is now in law, but rather sitting back and thinking, you know, here's another part of equity that should be brought over into law, not because the Act says so, but because we think it ought to be, just as we thought 50 years ago the tolling -- the -- the tolling provision should be brought over into law.  Have courts been -- been disabled from doing that by reason of the Act?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it says,  ""The rules shall not alter or amend any substantive right. ""  And what I'm saying is it isn't the rules that do it.  It's just we have made the independent justification that this ancient rule, which was applied in equity, ought to be applied in law as well.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yeah, but the -- the mortgagor does -- does not invest substantial amounts of money the way MGM did here on the assumption that since suit hasn't been brought for 20 years, there's -- there's no valid claim.  I mean, that's the difference in that situation.  You're talking about inducing, or causing at least, people who -- who proceed in good faith on the assumption that 20 years have gone by.  Nobody -- nobody has questioned our doing it.  They invest substantial amounts of money, and then when that money starts to pay off, you file suit and -- and you get 3 years' worth of -- of their profits.   Antonin Scalia  Why can't we change our mind?   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Because this is a statutory claim that -- and a statute of limitations that Congress put in place.  And the question is: What is the background rule against which Congress was acting?  Congress could change the background rule, but because this is a statutory action, it's for Congress to do it as opposed to the Court.   Antonin Scalia  And you say that none of the other instances in which we brought into law equitable doctrines, none of those were applied with respect to a prior enacted Federal statute?  Is that your position?   Nicole A. Saharsky  No.   Antonin Scalia  I'll have to look it up.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.  What I'm saying is specific to the laches defense, and what I'm saying there is that there is a long history that laches did not apply at law and that this Court has continued to recognize that--   Antonin Scalia  There was a long history that tolling didn't apply of law, and then we changed our mind.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Right.  But I'm saying--   Antonin Scalia  And you're saying we -- we never changed our mind where there was a statute of -- Federal statute of limitations?  I -- I don't believe that.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --I'm saying that in the laches context, we are not aware of any instances in which this Court has used laches to bar a claim at law--   Antonin Scalia  Did that equitable remedy overrule the statement that you're entitled to sue for all the profits within that 3-year period?  You're saying the injunction can in effect say you don't have to pay?   Nicole A. Saharsky  --Well, these are two different remedies.  There's the profits of--   Antonin Scalia  I understand that, but does the second eliminate the first?  If it doesn't eliminate the first, Justice Breyer's point is absolutely correct.   Nicole A. Saharsky  --I think that both are susceptible to the Court's equitable consideration.  The profits, the way that that is addressed in the Copyright Act is that it is the profits of the defendant, and you subtract out what the defendant contributed.   ",12-1315
0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Congress cited what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that may just mean, you know, where it is a defense, it is an affirmative defense that has to be treated the way Rule 8(c) says.  I don't think that Rule 8(c) establishes that it applies in law as well as in equity, and that's the question I want to ask you.  Do you -- do you say that laches was a defense available at law before the Federal Rules were enacted?  Or do you say that courts continue to have the power to bring it from equity into law after the rules were enacted?  And if the latter, why so?   Antonin Scalia  They had been used in law before, before the rules--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Did not dispute what?   Antonin Scalia  But you've said -- I think you've said that -- that it would apply to ordinary statute of limitations.  So if you have a six-year statute of limitations and you don't sue until five years after, you're subject to the defense, well, you should have -- should have sued sooner.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- I share Justice Kagan's reservation about that.  Could we limit our opinion just to rolling statutes?   ",12-1315
1,"Antonin Scalia  I guess you could have said the same thing under the Sherman Act before Rule 23 existed, right?   Antonin Scalia  Before there was such as thing as class actions.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The same thing would have been true.  If, indeed, your claim was so small that you can't claim -- can't pay an expert, you as a practical matter don't bring the suit.   Antonin Scalia  I suppose that American Express wouldn't have had to agree to arbitration at all, right?  They could have just said, you know, you -- you have a cause of action, you sue us in court, right?  They could say that, legally, couldn't they?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And until Rule 23 was adopted, that would mean, you know, if you had a small claim, tough luck, right?  De minimis non curate lex.  If it's just negligible, it's impracticable for you to bring a Federal claim.  And that would not violate the Sherman Act, would it?

0,"Antonin Scalia  I don't see -- I don't see how a Federal statute is frustrated or is unable to be vindicated if it's too expensive to bring a Federal suit.  That happened for years before there was such a thing as class action in Federal courts.  Nobody thought the Sherman Act was a dead letter, that it couldn't be vindicated.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I don't see why it's any different when you transpose the situation to the -- to the arbitration situation.   Antonin Scalia  You -- you -- I don't understand.  You think they could have appealed on that -- on that issue?   Antonin Scalia  Let me ask you.  Your effective vindicability principle depends upon a comparison with what you could do in Court.   Antonin Scalia  It doesn't?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but if you couldn't do it -- if you couldn't do it either -- even if there had been no arbitration agreement, how could the arbitration agreement be -- be harming you?  I don't understand that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or in court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have to compare it to court.  If you couldn't do it in court, you don't have to be able to do it in arbitration, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They could write a treatise on it, maybe.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Suppose this class could not -- could not qualify for certification in Federal court.  Are you asserting that there is some arbitration principle that -- that allows you to create some new class?   Antonin Scalia  So you have to make -- you have to make a comparison to what can be done in Federal court, don't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It isn't.  So that any class that the arbitrator thinks is okay is required.   Antonin Scalia  But he wants a class.  What he wants in arbitration is the ability to sue on behalf of a class, doesn't he?   Antonin Scalia  Is -- is that what you asked for below, anything, class action or compensation or whatever?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what I thought.  That's what I thought this case was about.  What's the question presented anyway?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Whether -- whether the Federal Arbitration Act permits courts invoking the Federal substantive law of arbitrability to invalidate arbitration agreements on the ground that they do not permit class arbitration of a Federal law claim.  Now, you're saying that -- that whether they permit class arbitration is not going to be decided on the basis of whether you could certify a class under Rule 23, but just what?  And -- and -- and if it does depend on that, what is the Court supposed to do?  Before it can -- it can give you your claim, it has to -- it has to decide whether this class would be certifiable, wouldn't it?  My goodness--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --this is a very complicated procedure.   Antonin Scalia  You should have said, “ I accept ”, very quickly.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  Would that be the case even before Rule 23 was -- was adopted?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even though you couldn't vindicate it in the Federal courts, you must be able to vindicate it in arbitration?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not even talking about a pure exculpatory clause.  I'm talking about the mere fact that as a practical matter, it's impossible to bring it in arbitration.  In a context in which it is also impossible to bring it in Federal court.  And you would say, still, you must permit it to be brought in arbitration, even though it can't be brought in Federal court.   Antonin Scalia  What -- what are the arbitration fees?  It's not -- not -- not lawyers' fees.  Do they include lawyers' fees?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So I don't know, what do you--   Antonin Scalia  --So what are you comparing it to in court litigation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  A filing fee?   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  They didn't get cert granted on that question at all.  As I pointed out before, they got it granted on whether the mere fact that the arbitration agreement did not permit class arbitration renders it invalid.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're saying -- you're saying that the -- that the deference which we give to arbitrator's statement of fact, like the deference we give to a lower court's adjudication of fact, has a limit, that at some point, the distortion of fact becomes an issue, a question of law rather than fact, right?   Antonin Scalia  Do you have other examples from other -- other review that we've given to arbitrators' factual decisions?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, I -- I don't want to adopt a special rule for -- for class actions, but if -- if you're telling me this is just a general principle, that at some point if it's too much off the wall, it becomes an error of law and -- and we can reverse it.  What -- what other examples do -- do we have?   Antonin Scalia  No, I want a case.  You're--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --But that is a class action case.  I -- I don't care what it said.

1,"Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's all he has to do is saying, you know, I'm -- I'm interpreting the contract, and whatever he says is okay then, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, we -- we were concerned in Stolt-Nielsen about a -- a -- a company betting the company, right, on -- on class action whenever -- whenever it agrees to arbitration, because class arbitration, you know, will bankrupt the company and without an appeal to the court or, you know, not -- not -- not much of an appeal anyway.  And you're saying that, in effect, you do bet the company every time.  So long as you leave it up to the arbitrator to decide whether there's a class action allowed or not, which most agreements probably do, he can find whatever he likes, right?  He can find -- so long as he says, I'm interpreting the agreement, it can be as wildly inconsistent with the agreement as you like and there's nothing the courts can do about it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you think that standard -- all that standard means is that the arbitrator has to say is, I am interpreting the contract, even though what he says is flatly, visibly, unquestionably contrary to what the contract says, and the court has to accept that, so long as he says, I'm interpreting the contract.   Antonin Scalia  Just exactly that?   Antonin Scalia  What supports his decision?  I mean, you -- you say that.  What -- what supports his decision that the parties here agreed, agreed, that's the standard.  Did they agree to class arbitration?  What -- what supports that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand.  There is a distinction between all disputes and all actions relating to the dispute?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The top of page 6?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  But that's not enough.  As stated by Justice Breyer, he has to have come to a plausible construction.  It's not enough that he said, I'm construing the contract; I have looked at the terms of the contract and what the parties' said, and my construction of the contract is X.  That's not enough.  It has to be plausible.   Antonin Scalia  Now, why is this plausible?   Antonin Scalia  What's a magic 8-ball?  I don't know what you are talking about.

I mean, they might have said, this arbitrator, he's a wild guy, he's going to say that -- that we agreed to class action.  We didn't agree to class -- I don't want this arbitrator.  They didn't agree to this arbitrator.  Why should they be bound by -- by whatever he says?   Antonin Scalia  How can they opt out if they've agreed to class arbitration?

Have there been dozens, hundreds, thousands?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you have any idea?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm sure there's been a number.  What's the number?

I mean, it seems to me the treaty sets the framework for an agreement, but it is ultimately the agreement that governs.   Ginger D. Anders  Well, there is no agreement unless the investor submits the claim to arbitration in accordance with the terms of the treaty, the conditions on the state's consent.  So, for instance, in the United States investment treaties and free trade agreements such as NAFTA the United States says that an investor may submit a claim to arbitration only if it first satisfies certainly procedural conditions.   Antonin Scalia  That's no different from the rules we apply when there isn't a treaty, of course.  I mean, if the arbitration agreement said that, that the -- you know, the agreement is conditioned on, of course.  So what else?  What different rules would you apply other than the common sense rules that we use for arbitration agreements?   Ginger D. Anders  --Well, you would also -- you would also look possibly for mandatory language in the treaty; so, for instance, if the treaty says that--   Antonin Scalia  We would look to mandatory language in the arbitration agreement.   Ginger D. Anders  --I think that's right, but the problem with applying Howsam is that it's a presumption that is purely based on the nature of the requirement, so the fact that it is a notice requirement, the fact that it is a time limit, that that means that it's procedural and, therefore, the arbitrators would decide unless it is clearly stated--   Antonin Scalia  They say that only the complaining party can bring a lawsuit.  Evidently they have no declaratory judgment procedure in Argentina.   Antonin Scalia  I was going to ask them that.   ",12-138X

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- it's true, but irrelevant.  They're arguing for a nationwide rule which applies to States other than California, that every State must allow marriage by same-sex couples.

You don't know where the gun is going to end up, do you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He made that up.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  And in some cases they can track it all the way.  In this case, unlike the hypothetical that Justice Alito gave you, if they went to the straw, to the straw purchaser, he would say: Oh, I actually bought it from my uncle.  And he'd give the uncle's name, and then the uncle would say, you know, where else the firearm went from him.   Antonin Scalia  What is the government's -- I guess I should ask the government, but does the government contend that there are two buyers now?  Both -- is the real buyer the person who sends in the straw man so that it's only his information that you have to give?  Or are there two buyers?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Could -- could you address the other -- the other point here, which is the one I have more trouble with, to tell you the truth, Count 2?   Antonin Scalia  Can you lie in -- in answering questions that the government has no technical right to answer?  I mean, let's assume I agree with you that, in fact, this information was -- the government was not authorized to obtain this information, and therefore, it was not required to be kept.  But nonetheless they asked it, and your client didn't just say, I won't answer.  He lied.  Now, can you -- can you lie, so long as the question is improper?   ",12-1493
0,"Antonin Scalia  As to the first, are there two buyers in your view?   Antonin Scalia  Well, what does -- what does the person who's buying for somebody else -- he has to provide both names or just the name of the real buyer?   Antonin Scalia  And both of them had to take possession, right?   Antonin Scalia  But that's not the case here.  The person who paid took possession, was authorized to take position.   Antonin Scalia  So there are two buyers and both of them have to be on the form.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can understand you saying the real buyer is the person who put up the money.   Antonin Scalia  Its current one.  It used to have a different one.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why is that -- why is that any more horrible than the notion that as soon as I buy it I walk out of the store and I meet this guy in the parking lot, he says: Hey, that's a nifty looking gun there.  How much did you pay for it?  He says: You know, I paid 600 dollars.  I'll give you 700.  Oh, it's yours.  Right?  I can hand it to him, can't I?   Antonin Scalia  So the notion that the gun would somehow get into the hands of somebody who, you know, who wasn't registered or who couldn't buy it himself, that's going to happen any way.  What you assert does not stop that problem.   Antonin Scalia  You wouldn't think of prosecuting him, would you?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Before you got on--   Antonin Scalia  --I wanted to get back to the Al Capone hypothetical.  As I understand Petitioner's case here, I don't think he's asserting that if Al Capone, if -- if he intended to transfer it to Al Capone, that his statement would not have been material.  His position is, since I intended to transfer it to somebody who could lawfully possess it, the statement was immaterial.   Antonin Scalia  Is that on the appendix to your brief?   Antonin Scalia  I can't look at all these things because they are not in your brief.  I really -- I really resent, especially in statutory cases, not having the statute in front of us.  I shouldn't have to flip through your -- your brief to see what page you cite a little snippet from one section on.   Antonin Scalia  This is a criminal statute.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the Government comes in and says “ I agree ” -- or if there was jurisdiction, why did the Court ever have to get to the merits?  If you have a, let's say, a lawsuit on an -- on an indebtedness and the alleged debtor comes in and says, yeah, I owe them money, but I'm just not gonna pay it, which is the equivalent of the Government saying, yeah, it's unconstitutional but I'm going to enforce it anyway.  What would happen in that -- in that indebtedness suit is that the court would enter judgment and say, if you agree that you owe it, by God, you should pay it.  And there would be a judgment right there without any consideration of the merits, right?  Why didn't that happen here?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Really, that's very peculiar.  When -- when both parties to the case agree on what the law is?  What, the -- just for fun, the district judge is -- is going to have a hearing?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not talking about jurisdiction now.  I'm talking about why the district court, without getting to the merits, should not have entered judgment against the Government.   Antonin Scalia  It has not arisen very often in the past, because in the past, when I was at the Office of Legal Counsel, there was an opinion of the Office of Legal Counsel which says that the Attorney General will defend the laws of the United States, except in two circumstances: Number one, where the basis for the alleged unconstitutionality has to do with presidential powers.  When the presidential powers are involved, he's the lawyer for the President.  So he can say, we think the statute's unconstitutional, I won't defend it.  The second situation is where no possible rational argument could be made in defense of it.  Now, neither of those situations exists here.  And I'm wondering if we're living in this new world where the Attorney General can simply decide, yeah, it's unconstitutional, but it's not so unconstitutional that I'm not willing to enforce it, if we're in this new world, I -- I don't want these cases like this to come before this Court all the time.  And I think they will come all the time if that's -- if that's -- if that's the new regime in the Justice Department that we're dealing with.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  It's not your view.  It's the President's.  It's only when the President thinks it's unconstitutional that you can decline to defend it?  Or what if the Attorney General thinks it's unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or the Solicitor General, is that enough?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, it can be either the Attorney General or the Solicitor General?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So when Congress enacts a statute, it cannot be defended, it has no assurance that that statute will be defended in court, if the Solicitor General in his view thinks it's unconstitutional?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that right?   Antonin Scalia  Yes or no?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not what the OLC opinion said, by the way.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Didn't Chadha -- didn't Chadha suggest that Congress could have standing in -- in Chadha?

Antonin Scalia  So you think that's bad as well, that all three of those has to be treated the same, despite State law about marriage.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand your answer.  Is your answer yes or no?  Is there a federalism problem with that, or isn't there a federalism problem?   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's just -- all these statutes use the term “ marriage ”, and the Federal Government says in all these statutes when it says marriage, it includes same-sex couples, whether the State acknowledges them to be married or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What do you mean whether or not it would work?  I don't care if it works.  [Laughter]  Does it -- does it create a federalism problem?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it's not doing that, it's just saying for purposes -- just what it's doing here.  It says, for purposes of all these Federal statutes, when we say marriage, we mean -- instead of saying we mean heterosexual marriage, we mean, whenever we use it, heterosexual and homosexual marriage.

Antonin Scalia  Well, you could convey anything justifiably, sure, I agree with that.   Antonin Scalia  But does defamatory require that it be materially false?  Can't I defame somebody with a statement in -- in which the derogatory information is not material to anything at all, but it's just derogatory?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Has to be materially false to sustain what?   Antonin Scalia  But it would still support a defamation, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because it is material to the person's reputation.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, you could say he's nuts, but the question isn't whether could say it.  The question is whether that is false.  I mean, the mere fact that -- that a lot of people will -- will exaggerate and say things that are simply not true doesn't make it okay.   Antonin Scalia  The point is that somebody ought to determine whether the exaggeration or whatever it was was material, whether -- whether it would have made any difference to TSA if it had been described otherwise.  And in this case, as I understand it, as -- as the Colorado Supreme Court said, nobody has made that determination; right?  The Colorado Supreme Court says it doesn't make any difference whether -- whether it would have affected TSA or not, putting it -- putting it the proper way, right?   Antonin Scalia  So that's what we're confronted with, simply the -- the need for somebody to make that factual determination, right?  And you're saying what?  There's no need to make it at all?   Antonin Scalia  There are two -- there are two different issues of falsity that we're talking about here, of materiality.  One is the defamation issue, and it is material to say that somebody is mentally unstable when all that he did was lose his temper.  Okay?  That's my view of it.  That does not answer the question of whether calling him mentally unstable, instead of he lost his temper or just saying he lost his temper, would have produced the same effect with the airlines, whether the airlines, even if he had said, well, he lost his temper, he's been fired from his job, he may have a -- he may have a gun, whether that alone, without saying he was mentally unstable, would have induced the airline to take him off the flight.  There are two different questions.  Materiality for defamation is -- is quite different from the materiality for purposes of obtaining the immunity under this Act.  The latter question is for the court, but the former is for the jury, it seems to me.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You'd give the jury two different instructions?  You are to find materiality for purposes of whether it's defamatory or not and then, having found that it is defamatory, you must make a second materiality finding, namely, would this defamatory statement have caused TSA -- if it had been accurate, would TSA not have taken the action that it did, not have removed this man from the flight?  You're going to give the jury those two instructions on materiality?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you'd -- you'd feel snug and comfortable in making reports to airlines, knowing that whether you're going to be held liable is going to be up to some jury who is going to see that this person, his career was ruined, and it's going to be up to the jury to say whether he can recover or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That doesn't give me a lot of comfort.  If you're really concerned about enabling people to come forward without fear when they have a suspicion of something I'm saying, well, you know, some jury will decide whether you put it wrongly or not and if you're putting it wrongly would have made a difference, it doesn't make me happy.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that -- that's the problem with your New York cases as well.  You -- you are focusing on property in another context, where the property is harmed, not whether property is taken.  You -- you have neither a New York case nor any other common law case involving extortion where the property taken consists of somebody's doing his job.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure that obtainable property and -- and harmable property are one and the same thing, I'm really not.   Antonin Scalia  You are -- you are contradicting what you yourself said a little bit before, which is that property means the same thing for both provisions--   Antonin Scalia  --for both the obtaining and the harming.

It's only those earrings you have to wear for work, otherwise, earrings are not clothes.  Ah, but if they're required for work, they become clothes.  It doesn't make any sense.   Antonin Scalia  Are there no non-unionized employers that -- that have to confront this problem, and they have to pay -- they have to pay for work time, no?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, and everybody else has to pay for the changing time, right?   Antonin Scalia  It is, so you -- so you have the same issue there, don't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and the union cannot pull your chestnuts out of the fire.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know.   ",12-417X
0,"Antonin Scalia  So I assume that applies to all Federal crimes, right?  Anyone convicted of any Federal crime can thereafter be subjected to whatever civil restraints Congress later decides are -- are a good idea in order to prevent that crime, that type of crime from reoccurring, right?  I mean, nothing peculiar here about sex crimes.  Any -- any crime Congress can later decide, you know, it would be a good idea if when -- when a person has committed, I don't know, crime with the use of a gun, we -- we impose retroactively all sorts of different civil limitations.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no, that's not the point, that it's -- that it's retroactive.  The point is that it is not in execution of a Federal power.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That would be an execution of a Federal power--   Antonin Scalia  --the power -- the power to prevent that crime and to punish it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But they have to be imposed simultaneously as -- as the punishment for the crime of which the individual has been convicted.  Here, the trial is over, the conviction is over, and then some years later the Federal Government decides, oh, it would be a good idea if people who have committed sex crimes are -- are subjected to these limitations.  That's quite different from imposing that simultaneously as -- as a punishment for the crime.  This is not a punishment for the crime, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  So it's just by a preponderance of the evidence we think this guy probably, you know, 51/49, committed a sex crime.   Antonin Scalia  So just -- just more -- more likely than not is the test.   Antonin Scalia  To -- to what does this civil -- civil-criminal line apply?  Suppose instead of a registration requirement, Congress just decided, you know, our past punishments for sex offenses have not been -- have not been severe enough, and so we are now going to impose a civil fine on all -- all persons who have been convicted in Federal court of sex crimes.  It's a civil -- it's a civil penalty, not a criminal penalty.  That's okay?   Antonin Scalia  I find that difficult to believe that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that whether it's ex post facto and impermissible or not is simply eliminated, that issue was eliminated by simply calling it civil.   Antonin Scalia  I'm talking about the -- ex post facto.   Antonin Scalia  Because it's civil.   Antonin Scalia  I -- I find that difficult to grasp.   Antonin Scalia  It -- it seems to me that when -- when you say that as your answer to the Chief Justice, you're -- you're no longer relying on -- on the power to regulate the military.  You're relying on -- on some general Federal power to protect citizens against people who have committed any Federal crimes.  And I -- I don't see that enumerated power in the Constitution.  Yes, I see a power to regulate the military, but your description, it has nothing to do with regulating the military.  It has to do with protecting the -- the public at large from people who have committed Federal crimes, military or not.   Antonin Scalia  That's right, because it protects Federal functions.  The Federal -- the criminal applicability to the armed forces protects the function of regulating the armed forces.  But how does protecting the public at large from people who have committed a crime in the armed forces, how does that have anything to do with regulating the armed forces.   Antonin Scalia  But that's not unusual.  When you're released from the military, for example, you're no longer subject to -- to Congress's jurisdiction over the military.  That's a matter of timing too, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Not for something that they've done after they left the military.  That's a question of timing.  Had they left the military when they committed this crime?  If so, they can't be prosecuted under -- under that power of the Federal Government.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's part of his sentence.  That's part of the punishment imposed.  You assert that this is not part of the punishment imposed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.  Who knows what they'll do, right?   ",12-418X

And even -- even if you would allow that, and say it is a reasonable -- it has a reasonable connection to the power to regulate the military, to say wherever he goes he has to register is -- is a different question, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  We've never -- we've never held, have we, that what the Federal Government can itself do under the Necessary and Proper Clause it can impose upon individuals to do under the Necessary and Proper Clause?  Aren't there two different -- what is necessary and proper for the Federal Government itself to do is not necessarily necessary and proper for the Federal Government to require private individuals to do.

1,"Antonin Scalia  No.  I think you have to conceive of it that way, but that still makes it a unilateral contract.  It's not a promise in exchange for another promise.  It's a promise in exchange for the performance of an act; that is, flying the airline, you know, a certain number of miles.  You're correct, it is a -- a unilateral contract.  Now, whether that -- that means that there's no -- is there no such thing as an illusory unilateral contract?   Antonin Scalia  You're not trying to enforce the contract anyway.  You -- you want to get out of the contract.  So you -- you ought to be happy to have it pronounced an illusory contract, right?  What do you care?   Antonin Scalia  Is that entirely -- I mean, suppose the contract said  ""in its absolute discretion and subject to no obligation of good faith. ""  Suppose it said that.  Would State law still impose an obligation of good faith?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it might well or it would?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, this State.  I mean, the State we're talking about.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I suppose you could say that it is assumed that parties to a contract comport with community standards of fairness and decency.  You know, you can wiggle to there if you want.   Antonin Scalia  I don't want to have to sort those out State by State.  I mean, it seems to me the -- the regime proposed by the Petitioner is -- is much more manageable.  If it goes beyond the words of the contract, it -- and you're reading into it something that it doesn't say, it's a matter of State policy.  So I can -- I can work with that.  But you're -- you're asking me to go through each of the 50 States one by one to decide, oh, which -- which of these are really trying to discern the intent of the parties and which ones aren't.  Especially since you discern the intent of the parties by simply saying, well, parties intend to apply community standards, right?  And there'll be different community standards in every State presumably.  Some States are more honest than others, right?   Antonin Scalia  There are variances, but not variances in such an ineffable question as to whether this is really an effort to discern the real intent of the parties or rather, whether it's an intent to impose community standards, especially since, as I say, parties intend to adopt community standards usually.

0,"Antonin Scalia  As I understand your argument -- correct me if I am wrong -- he could be terminated without reasonable cause if he happened to be from a State or if the suit was brought under the governing law of a State which imposed this obligation of good faith as a matter of law.  The State says: Regardless of what the contract says, even if it says in its sole discretion without any obligation of good faith, even if it says that, as a matter of law, there is an obligation of good faith.  As I understand your case, you acknowledge that in that State he would simply be out of luck.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He would have no cause of action, because this is obviously not an interpretation of the contract; it is an imposition of a State requirement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  I just--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Wow, somebody's really been given a raw deal.  You know, that's still going to be possible even if we rule for you here.  It depends on what State he's from, right?   Antonin Scalia  Some do, some don't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ms. Rosenbaum, in -- in our decision in this case, do you think we should apply the presumption against preemption of State law?   Antonin Scalia  But the whole purpose of the ADA was to preempt State laws.  I mean, I can understand applying that presumption to other statutes which say nothing about preemption.  The whole purpose of the ADA was to deregulate airlines, was to say there was going to be no Federal regulation.  Let the free market handle it and there be will be no State regulation.  And you want us to apply a presumption against preemption to that statute?   Antonin Scalia  Would this contract produce a different result if it did not contain the words ‶ in its sole discretion ″?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you'd -- you'd -- you'd still apply the very same doctrine of reasonableness, right?  So the words ‶ in its sole discretion ″ become superfluous.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I guess different States will treat that differently as well, right?   Antonin Scalia  I find it hard to believe that you're doing nothing but interpreting a contract when you -- you give it the same outcome, whether it says in its sole discretion or does not say in its sole discretion.  I -- I find it hard to grasp how what you're doing in that -- in that case is simply interpreting the contract.   Antonin Scalia  Why does -- it relates to prices.  Even if you get credit for miles from staying in certain hotels, it still has the effect of lowering the price for your airline ticket.  And likewise, if you can use your frequent flyer miles to get cheaper hotel rooms, that effectively lowers the price of your airline ticket, doesn't it?  I mean, it doesn't seem to me to make any difference whether the only thing you get from the frequent flyer mileage is, you know, is airfares or other goodies.  They are all price.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm sorry.  You are talking about a situation where you can assign your mileage to somebody else who can get the hotel room?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The person who gets the discount for the hotel room is the person who bought the airline ticket, right?   Antonin Scalia  What you say would apply to other contractual obligations of the airlines, right?  So if the airline says you have to get off the plane if the flight attendant tells you to do so, there is going to be a good faith obligation attached to that, so you can challenge, challenge those decisions in court?

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I -- you know, I -- I find it hard to think that -- that the right of property is any more sacrosanct than the -- the right to freedom of the person.  And we allow a grand jury indictment without -- without a separate mini-trial to justify the arrest and -- and holding of -- of the individual.  And if he -- if he doesn't have bail, he's permanently in jail until the trial is over.  And we allow all of that just on the basis of a grand jury indictment.  And you're telling us it's okay for that -- maybe you think it's not okay for that.  But I think you're saying it's okay for that, but it's not okay for distraining his property.  I -- I find it hard to -- to think that it's okay for the one and not okay for the other.   Antonin Scalia  Ah, okay.  This is a bigger case than I thought.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is this only in the case where the person has no other assets, where all of his assets are seized so that he can't -- he can't hire counsel?  Suppose only half of his assets are determined to -- or asserted by the government to have been the product of criminal activity, and he has a lot of other money with which he can hire an attorney.  Is that a different case?  And we're not -- that's not before us here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you have a hearing on whether he has other money, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's terrible.  We shouldn't allow that.  We shouldn't even hold the fellow.  We've been doing it for a thousand years, though, and it's hard to say that it violates what our concept of fundamental fairness is.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But a grand jury indictment doesn't -- doesn't establish that there is probable cause to believe that the person is a flight risk.  That doesn't contradict what the grand jury found.  You're asking the judge here to contradict what the grand jury found.   Antonin Scalia  And in the next case we have, if we agree with you, will be somebody saying due process does not allow you to proceed with a trial when it has been found by an impartial judge that there is no probable cause.  That will be our next case, right?  And you may well argue it.  To tell you the truth, I would prefer -- to save your client, I would prefer a rule that says you cannot, even with a grand jury indictment, prevent the defendant from using funds that are in his possession to hire counsel.  Don't need a hearing.  Just, just it's unconstitutional for the rule to be any broader than withholding money that the defendant does not need to defend himself.  Would you like that?  I really prefer it to yours.  I think yours leads us into really strange territory.   Antonin Scalia  Does this hearing include an assessment of the reasonableness of attorneys' fees?  I mean, if you're only withholding the amount of money necessary for the defense, what if this fellow wants to hire Clarence Darrow?  Does -- does that give him all the money?  How -- how do you decide that issue?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But does he know his lawyer -- is his lawyer there saying, you know, this is the lawyer I'm going to hire and here's the fee I'm going to charge?   Antonin Scalia  But you -- you acknowledge that that could be -- that could be an issue in the hearing in other cases.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't know what the fees are.  I don't even know who the lawyer's going to be.  This defendant just comes in and says, I want to hire a lawyer.  And the court says, you know, any particular lawyer?  No, I just want a lawyer.  The court's going to have to make up a fee, I assume, right?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  He has to choose a lawyer before this hearing, right?   Antonin Scalia  Tell me something, because I don't know the answer.  Can -- can the government track tainted funds that -- that have been given to other people, including lawyers?   Antonin Scalia  I think they can too.  So what happens if this lawyer gets his $500,000 and you've had the traceability hearings, so these are tainted funds?

Why did they do it if they knew it was already included?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I really don't understand -- I didn't understand the law to be that.  You mean if an employee files a discrimination claim, and then is fired -- let's assume there is no other reason except retaliation; he's fired for filing that claim -- he has to prove not only that he was fired in retaliation for filing, but also that his claim was valid?  Is that what you are saying the law is?   Antonin Scalia  I thought that's what you were saying.  I thought that's what Justice Alito's question asked.   Antonin Scalia  In his hypothetical, he did.  Justifiable retaliation, as far as I am concerned.  I mean, the employer files a frivolous claim to embarrass the employer.  He can't erase that from his mind.  That's one of the reasons he fired this guy.  And you say: Ooh, if that's one of the reasons, no matter how frivolous or anything else, he's liable under the law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand that.  Do you understand that?   Antonin Scalia  But -- but not under this statute.  What I'm concerned about is the text of this statute, which simply destroys your argument that there's no difference between retaliation and race discrimination.  Section 2000e-5(g)(2)(A) limits remedies where a defendant acted -- and this is a quote from the statute --  ""for any reason other than discrimination on -- on account of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or in violation of Section 2000e-3(a) of this title. ""  It -- it separates out 2000e-3(a), retaliation, from the other aspects of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin discrimination.   Antonin Scalia  Sir, the statute says what it says.  It doesn't matter when Congress put it in there.  The statute has to be read as a whole.  And if you read it as a whole, this provision clearly separates out retaliation from race discrimination.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Period.  I mean, it doesn't -- I don't have to psychoanalyze Congress and say did they really mean it, blah, blah, blah.  It's there in the statute.  They didn't take it out.  The statute still makes a clear distinction between the two.   Antonin Scalia  It might be a good idea, though, and -- and if so, Congress can do it, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the issue is whether this statute does it or not.  The fact that nobody has ever done it before, what difference does that make?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I don't understand.  Say again?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You -- you talk about Congress as though it's a continuing body out there, the same people, and would the same people that did this do that.  They are not the same people.  I don't know what Congress it was that passed this particular act versus other antidiscrimination acts.  Some of them may have been Democratic Congresses and others may have been Republican Congresses.  To -- to assume that there is one Congress out there that -- that has to operate logically in all these areas, it seems to me unrealistic.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you think that rule would apply even when at the time the statute in question was enacted there was no belief that there was tribal immunity on State lands?

To the extent you say the case doesn't involve New Hampshire's towing law but involves just its general consumer protection law, it's -- it's even further distant from being preempted.  I--   Antonin Scalia  --Suppose -- I understand.  My goodness.  Suppose a vehicle -- I pay for somebody to tow -- I agree that somebody will tow my vehicle and I will pay them $100.  And he tows the vehicle, puts it in my garage and says, give me the $100.  And I say, ha, ha, I'm not going to give you $100.  Now, do you think that that general obligation under State law to pay a debt that you've contracted to pay is eliminated?   Antonin Scalia  Why is that different from normal consumer protection law?  I -- I don't see that it's so much different.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It -- it includes storage, is the point you are coming to, right?   Antonin Scalia  The definition includes storage.  You think it means -- it means storage at the end of the transportation?  Suppose you're -- you're a company that moves goods, but we also store goods.  You can, you know, rent -- rent space and we will store your furniture for years.  If that company picks up some goods, brings it to its warehouse and leaves it in its warehouse for 3 years, that storage is covered by this -- by this statute, you think?  See, I thought the storage was -- was storage in the course of the transportation.  Sometimes when you're, you know, changing the mode of transportation, going from trucks to ships or something, you have to store it temporarily during -- during the course of the transportation.  That's how I would read it.  But you're saying, even if you're a storage company, if you pick up goods and bring it to the place where you store it, that's covered by -- by this statute.   Antonin Scalia  Well, let me tell you how we -- it seems to me we've limited it in -- in the Columbus case, Columbus v. Harrah's Garage and Wrecker Services, Inc. We said that,  ""The clause -- the clause's limitation to motor carrier services with respect to the transportation of property massively limits the scope of preemption to include only laws, regulations, and other provisions that single out for special treatment motor carriers of property. ""  And here you've told us that this case doesn't involve any law that singles them out for -- for special treatment.  To the contrary, it's the general consumer protection law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you want us to eat those words, they were wrong, or -- or somehow you don't come within them?   Antonin Scalia  Ah.  [Laughter]  I forgot that.

And I think what your brother's argument is, is that this significantly affects the service, whether he can collect for the storage after, you know, after the -- after towing it by -- by selling it, and by selling it on terms that are not so onerous as to impinge upon his -- his ability to run the business.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He's worried that it'll be preempted.   Antonin Scalia  And he didn't -- he didn't mention Cambridge, did he?   Antonin Scalia  I don't think so.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, you're both from Boston, Massachusetts.   Antonin Scalia  I think maybe -- maybe we have to make it up, what the limitation -- I mean, you're quite right, everything's related to everything else.  And we've had trouble with the same -- the very same words with ERISA, and -- and started off trying to give it its -- its apparent meaning, “ related to ”, and we finally concluded you can't do that.  So what do you want us to make up?  What kind of a limitation do you--   Antonin Scalia  --Related to -- related to -- related to the movement of the property.  That's the problem.

Antonin Scalia  How do we discover that?  Do we look into the city council hearings or what?

It is, Your Honor, particularly in the current environment where the national political parties are -- are being marginalized by outside forces.   Antonin Scalia  And -- and much of the money that used to go to them now goes to PACs; isn't that what has happened?     Exactly right, Your Honor.

Now, I ask myself, why would -- why would members of Congress want to hurt their political parties?  And I answer -- I answer to myself--  [Laughter]  --well, ordinarily, the national political parties will devote their money to elections in those States where the incumbent has a good chance of losing.  So, in fact, if you're an incumbent who cares about political parties, I don't want money to go to my opponents.  And if you -- if you turn down the amount of money that the national political parties have, that's that much less money that can be devoted against you if you're challenged in a close race.  Isn't that the consequence of this?     Let me see you and raise you one.  There are separate limits here, Your Honor, for candidates and for political parties.  The effect of this is to insulate the incumbents from competing with the political parties for the dollars.

I mean, if gratitude is corruption, you know, don't those independent expenditures evoke gratitude?  And is -- is not the evil of big money -- 3.2 million, an individual can give that to an independent PAC and spend it, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not that we're stopping people from spending big money on politics.     The foundation of this Court's jurisprudence in this area is the careful line between independent expenditures, which this Court has held repeatedly do not create a sufficient risk of quid pro quo corruption to justify their regulation, and contributions which do.   Antonin Scalia  Wait.  That -- that--     So we're not talk--   Antonin Scalia  --That line eliminates some of the arguments that have been made here, which are arguments against big money in politics.  There -- big money can be in politics.  The thing is you can't give it to the Republican Party or the Democratic Party, but you can start your own PAC.  That's perfectly good.  I'm not sure that that's a benefit to our political system.   Antonin Scalia  What if Boeing does it?  I mean, you know--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You think no problem?   Antonin Scalia  That's fine.  They're regulated.  That's the law, but the question says -- what the question is directed at, given that that's the law, isn't the consequence of -- of this particular provision to sap the vitality of political parties and to encourage -- what should I say -- you know, drive-by PACs for each election?  Isn't that the consequence?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think we do.   Antonin Scalia  You say -- you say it's $3.5 million.  If you assume somebody that gives the maximum to every possible candidate and party he can contribute to throughout the United States, 3.5 million.  Just to put that in perspective, how much money is spent by political parties and PACs in all elections throughout the country--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --in one election cycle?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you have any idea much?   Antonin Scalia  1.5 billion.   Antonin Scalia  And what about PACs?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, but that was a lot in the last few elections, wasn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and what about newspapers that -- that spend a lot of money in endorsing candidates and promoting their candidacy.  I suppose, you know, you -- you have to put in that money, too.  That is money that is directed to political speech.  When you add all that -- add -- when you add all that up, I don't think 3.5 million is a heck of a lot of money--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --spread throughout the country.   Antonin Scalia  General Verrilli, it seems to me -- it seems to me fanciful to think that the sense of gratitude that an individual Senator or Congressman is going to feel because of a substantial contribution to the Republican National Committee or Democratic National Committee is any greater than the sense of gratitude that that Senator or Congressman will feel to a PAC which is spending enormous amount of money in his district or in his State for his election.  I mean, it seems to me the latter is much more identifiable, and there is nothing in the law that excludes that.  So apparently that's not too much of a risk.   Antonin Scalia  It is what it is, though.   INTERRUPTING ",12-536X
1,"Antonin Scalia  200 years -- 200 years?  Did you say that?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I -- I would have thought your -- you can get to your second one, but I would have thought your first response to -- to the question would have been to deny that you say it's clear because the Supreme Court of Michigan has said so.  I thought your argument is it's clear because it's clear.   Antonin Scalia  Ah, okay.  It should have been your first point.  The premise is simply wrong.  You're saying it was clear because the statute's clear.   Antonin Scalia  I think he contested that.  I think he never went further into it, but he seemed to disagree with the proposition that where there is a Michigan statute it can't be supplemented by the common law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You -- you rely on Reese as establishing the principle that you cannot supplement the defenses in a criminal statute, but Reese was a 2012 case.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I assume you'd need a case in which the prosecutor was pretty, pretty clear that a diminished capacity defense would prevail.  Otherwise, it wouldn't -- the game wouldn't be worth the camel, right?   ",12-547X
0,"Antonin Scalia  He would have been able to raise it.  There's a lot of question about whether it would have been successful, because if it had gone up to the Michigan Supreme Court -- the statute was in effect during his first trial?   Antonin Scalia  He could have raised it, but if it went up to the Michigan Supreme Court, it would have had the same result as here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And your only -- your only defense would have been, oh, it's a great surprise.  But I don't see how it's a surprise if the Michigan law has been, as -- as the Solicitor General of Michigan has described it, that -- that there's a clear tradition.  If -- if the statute addresses the area, the courts will not -- will not supplement it by -- by common law additions.  Did he not know that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why do you say it was firmly -- do you -- do you contest the -- the assertion by the solicitor general that there is no case which -- which acknowledged and held the defense of diminished capacity?   Antonin Scalia  Is that wrong?   Antonin Scalia  What -- what case--   Antonin Scalia  --lets the defendant off on the basis of diminished capacity?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What case has a holding, a holding that diminished capacity excuses the crime or mitigates the crime.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Or -- is that correct?  Wouldn't -- wouldn't the supreme court have done that if it -- if it thought that at least -- at least it was arguable?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Mogill, as -- as I understand your burden here, it's -- it's not enough to show that Michigan law seemed to be what you -- what you say it was; but it has to have been--   Antonin Scalia  --what you say it was.   Antonin Scalia  And it -- there was an evulsive change by the supreme court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's -- it's hard to believe that, given -- given the clear text of the statute.   Antonin Scalia  Now, if -- if a prosecutor raised that objection knowing that the court of appeals would -- would reverse the exclusion, right -- I mean, it's clear what the court of appeals would have done, right?   Antonin Scalia  And once the court of appeals reversed it and said the trial was infected with that error, could -- could the defendant be retried?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because he's -- he's convicted and the -- I'm sorry -- he's -- he's--   Antonin Scalia  --That's right.   Antonin Scalia  Could he be retried?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, then -- then you would be crazy to raise it as a prosecutor.   Antonin Scalia  He could get an -- an interlocutory appeal on that?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Was that -- how often was it mentioned in intermediate court opinions?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Four mentions in the supreme court that say what?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes.   Antonin Scalia  Have we ever held that a State law has been determined to be X simply because intermediate State courts have uniformly held it to be X?  Never mind assumed it to be X; have held it to be X?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It doesn't mean it's right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You have to show it's right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That it's the law.   ",12-547X
1,"Antonin Scalia  I was just going to ask: If the question were determined of whether the sham transaction counts as an erroneous statement of the basis, if that were determined at the partner level and not in a partnership proceeding, would it be possible to have different outcomes--   Antonin Scalia  --with respect to different partners?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and you have to relitigate the same issue.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  Why would it vary from partner to partner?   ",12-562X
0,"Antonin Scalia  But it doesn't just say partnership items.  Yes,  ""A court in which jurisdiction a petition is filed shall have jurisdiction to determine all partnership items. ""  But then it goes on:  ""The proper allocation of such items among the partners and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to an adjustment to a partnership item. ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What -- what can that possibly mean when you're talking about the applicability of any penalty?   Antonin Scalia  That penalty is going to be applicable at the partner stage.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So what?   Antonin Scalia  But it is in addition to partnership item.  You say: Oh, you can't do that because it would add to partnership item.  But the statute does not say “ just partnership item ”.  It says  ""partnership items, the proper allocation of such items, and the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount. ""   Antonin Scalia  It's in addition to partnership items.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and it's, it seems to me, not enough to say, well, if you interpret that third part to go beyond partnership items, you're destroying the statute.  I don't think so.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  When would you not have to do that if you are applying the third item,  ""the applicability of any penalty, addition to tax, or additional amount which relates to adjustment to a partnership? ""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That will always require you to go down to the partner level.   Antonin Scalia  Couldn't the Government have pursued this instead of saying, you know, it's a sham partnership, just -- just -- couldn't the Government simply have said that the partnership overstated its basis?   Antonin Scalia  Now, I have a second question which I asked your friend as well.  Is he correct that if we rule for you, each partner may have a different result because different courts will find this to be a sham or not to be a sham?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but why -- why wouldn't -- couldn't one court say I don't think it's a sham partnership?   ",12-562X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Do you have any preference as to which of those errors you would like us to rely on?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, the venue question does not -- does not bring into the Court a constitutional question and the jurisdictional -- the jurisdictional one does.   Antonin Scalia  And we usually try to avoid constitutional questions.   Antonin Scalia  It's the largest market for everything, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Did the affidavit ever get to Nevada?   Antonin Scalia  Ms. Sherry, you -- would you want us to decide this case on the jurisdictional question or the venue question?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  That's why I asked the question.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  You say the affidavit wouldn't give rise to a Fourth Amendment claim.   ",12-574X
0,"Antonin Scalia  They didn't really injure a person in State B here.  I mean, these people were in Georgia when the injury occurred.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're really arguing for a very broad principle.  Whenever there is an intentional tort, you can be haled into court at the place of residence of the person against whom the tort is committed.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, that's what I thought you were saying.   Antonin Scalia  Was the money here in Georgia the whole time?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was it still there in that locker?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you could say that about whatever rule we adopt.  Once we adopt the rule, when -- the defendant will know that if he violates that rule, he's going to be hailed into court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, it's sort of a self-fulfilling point you're making.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you are libeled wherever it is published.  You don't have to be there where it's published.  You are libeled wherever it is published.   Antonin Scalia  So -- so you could say that Calder, far from being an expansive decision, was a narrowing decision.  It said, you know, there's jurisdiction not necessarily everywhere where the libel was published, which is where the injury occurs, but there is jurisdiction only in California, where these other connections exist.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Except it's harder for you to establish that the injury occurred in Nevada.   Antonin Scalia  But our jurisdiction cases have not been based on where you expected to be sued.  You could expect to be sued anywhere if the State says you are going to be sued here.  Our cases have focused on whether the State has jurisdiction, whether the State has enough connection with it to assert its power; not the expectation of the defendant, but the power of the State.  That's what's going on here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's your new test, just whether you could expect this to happen?   ",12-574X
1,"Antonin Scalia  Of course, that would -- that would be true, the last would be true even if the Defendant had not sought to introduce expert evidence of his own, right?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, the issue is not whether the State can call its own expert.  The issue is whether the State can compel him to speak to its expert--   Antonin Scalia  --without which the expert can testify, right?   Antonin Scalia  But sort of coming back to Justice Ginsburg's question, the Kansas Supreme Court held that the introduction of -- of the allegedly compelled testimony given to the -- to the psychiatrist violated the Federal Constitution.  But why didn't -- why didn't the Kansas Supreme Court simply hold that there was no -- no right on the part of the prosecution to obtain that rebuttal evidence or to introduce it since this was a case of voluntary intoxication?  You -- you tell me that Kansas does not allow this just for voluntary intoxication and that was -- that was the defense he was raising, right?   Antonin Scalia  That's what they did.  So when -- when we send it back, is it still open to them to decide that under Kansas law the testimony was not introducible?   Antonin Scalia  And that is, as you say, a question of -- of Kansas law.  So it would be odd for us to resolve that anyway.   Antonin Scalia  I'm saying the question of whether the -- the cross-examination went beyond the scope of the direct and whether that invalidated it, that wouldn't be resolved under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but rather under Kansas law, right?   Antonin Scalia  It seems to me--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, wait.  I mean, all the State -- I think it oversimplifies it to say that when -- when the defendant puts it at issue, the government can respond.  Yes, the government -- the government can respond with whatever evidence it has, but the issue here is not whether the government can respond.  The issue is whether the government can compel the Defendant to undergo a psychiatric examination.  That's -- that's quite a different issue really from whether the government can respond.  Of course it can respond.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  More precisely, it's not that the State can have its own expert.  It's that the State can compel the defendant to testify to an expert, can compel the defendant to speak to a psychiatrist.  That's really the issue, not -- not whether the government can respond.  Of course it can respond.   INTERRUPTING ",12-609X
0,"Antonin Scalia  But Kansas decided the constitutional question, and we can't send it back unless we reverse the Supreme Court of Kansas.  So you say we're going to dodge the constitutional question?  How can we?  I think it has been decided by the Kansas Supreme Court.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  On what basis can we vacate?  We can't vacate a decision unless there's something wrong with it.  What's wrong with it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's error?  I mean, I understand it's general policy you don't reach a constitutional question unless you have to.  But I've never heard of the proposition that if a court unnecessarily reaches a constitutional question it can be reversed, that we can send it back and say: Don't reach the constitutional question.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think so.  Kansas decided the constitutional question.  We took the case in order to decide that, and I think we have to decide it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Of course, there is nothing unusual about saying if the defendant introduces certain evidence, he has to forfeit some of his Fifth Amendment self-incrimination rights.   Antonin Scalia  It happens every time the defendant chooses to testify.   Antonin Scalia  He need not testify, but if he introduces that evidence he must submit to cross-examination and has to incriminate himself.  And this is, it seems to me, quite similar.  He need not introduce the evidence of the psychiatrist, but if he does he has to forfeit his Fifth Amendment right not to talk to a psychiatrist.   Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  But it's still -- it's still the same -- the same correlative system playing--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That the defendant does one thing, he has to accept what goes along with it, and that includes waiving or forfeiting his -- his right not to incriminate himself.   Antonin Scalia  That's not getting into the defendant's mind.   Antonin Scalia  It's only the psychiatrist who can get into the defendant's mind when he is -- when he is raising a mental capacity defense.   Antonin Scalia  When you say as the price for putting on his defense, you mean as the price for introducing the testimony of a psychological expert.   Antonin Scalia  I'll bet you the prosecution would accept your alternative in a heartbeat.  [Laughter]  No defendant can introduce any psychiatric evidence.  That's a good deal for the prosecution.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  A mandatory schedule?   Antonin Scalia  A mandatory schedule, you say?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, okay.   Antonin Scalia  It's not a change of the law if -- if the law does not require the guidelines to be imposed.  Your -- your case rests upon the proposition you stated at the outset, which is that the Ex Post Facto Law applies -- prohibition applies -- if there is a substantial possibility of -- of a higher sentence -- was that the language you used?   Antonin Scalia  Significant risk.  Suppose -- suppose the district judge for the Federal district in which somebody's crime was committed was a -- a bleeding heart judge.  He always gave the lowest sentence possible, and everybody knew that.  And he is replaced.  He retires after the arrest, after the crime, and he is replaced by Maximum John, who everybody knows gives the highest sentence every time.  Ex post -- ex post facto violation?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What about the statutes allowing relatives and friends of the victim to testify?  Let's assume a crime committed before -- a horrible crime committed before that statute is enacted, does it violate the ex post facto law to give effect to that statute?   Antonin Scalia  Why?  Don't -- don't you think it creates a significant risk--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --if the defendant will get a higher sentence?  Don't you think that's the whole object of the law, in fact?   Antonin Scalia  Is that -- is that what -- who says that they're the benchmark that you start with?  Where is that writ?   Antonin Scalia  A court -- a court must begin with that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Your -- your case depends, it seems to me, upon the proposition that significant risk is only applicable at the sentencing stage.  And I'm not sure that that's true.  I mean, what -- why -- why would that be so?  What if -- what if you have a new law that permits evidence to come in, in a criminal trial that previously was not allowed to come in, let's say the testimony of a wife or whatever.  I think the law is pretty well established that that change in procedure does not violate the ex post facto law.  And your response to that is: Well, that's not sentencing; it's trial.  So what?  I mean, if -- certainly making a conviction more likely is -- is even worse than making a higher sentence more likely.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But saying that the sentencer has to consider testimony from the victim or from relatives of the deceased, that -- that change in sentencing law is okay?   Antonin Scalia  It pertains to sentencing.  It -- it says what the sentencing authority, the judge or the jury, must consider.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is evidence brought before the sentencer.   Antonin Scalia  I don't see any difference between that and saying that the -- the guidelines have to be considered by the sentencer.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does it “ affix a higher punishment ”, in the words of Calder v. Bull?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't think that's a question at all.  The answer to that is quite easy.  It does not affix a higher punishment, does it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Then rely on Garner, but not on Calder v. Bull.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That doesn't help--   ",12-62XX
1,"Antonin Scalia  I disagree with all that, by the way.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I assume that the statute is one that permits 10 days, right?  Sort of an unusual statute, but if the hypothetical is in the real world, the statute provides, you know, 10 days to life, okay?  And the judge thinks 10 days is okay.  I think that's the hypothetical.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I think you are saying that it doesn't matter because they are advisory--   Antonin Scalia  --It is reversible error, is it not, simply to blindly apply the guidelines without considering the factors in 3553?  That's reversible, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Feigin, I'm under the impression -- more than the impression I know -- that the Sentencing Commission can make a revision of the guidelines retroactive.  Can it only do that for revisions that lower the -- the suggested penalty or can it do that for revisions that increase it as well?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Only for lower, okay.  Because if it could increase it, then it would be violating, according to your friend, the Ex Post Facto Clause.   ",12-62XX
0,"Antonin Scalia  So that form should have included the eligibility requirements that your State demands.  And it seems to me your complaint is that the Federal form does not require proof of citizenship, unless you consider just the statement that I'm a citizen to be proof of citizenship.  But why didn't you challenge the form?  I mean, that's -- that's my problem with this.  I frankly think that Federal form doesn't make much sense unless it's -- unless it's to be exclusive for Federal voting.  And -- and why didn't you challenge the -- the refusal of the Commission to include on the form as additional State requirements the proof of citizenship?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you're -- you're simply denying then that the Federal Government can, so long as it protects the requirements that your State imposes, you're -- you're saying the Federal Government cannot prescribe a single form for -- for voter registration.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why -- why can't it make it exclusive?  Let's assume -- I think -- I think that -- that accept and -- and employ, whatever the language is--   Antonin Scalia  --suppose -- suppose I think that that does mean that it's supposed to be exclusive.  What harm is there so long as the Federal Commission requires as part of the Federal form all of the necessary proofs of -- of qualification that the State imposes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you did nothing more about that?   Antonin Scalia  You -- you didn't go to court to say you have to include this as one of the State-specific requirements.  Why didn't you do that?   Antonin Scalia  Oh.  Okay.  Why didn't he do it?  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How could you establish citizenship without having something mailed in, in addition to the form?  What are the other State-specific requirements?  You have to put down your driver's license number or some other numbers?  I -- I guess you could -- you could make them check off place of birth and if that place of birth is not the United States, you could require them to write down some number of -- of their admission to citizenship.  Are there -- are there numbers that you could demand?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, that's the kind of thing you should have had and that your predecessor should have asked for to be included in the Federal form.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't think they're driving the bus as to the form.  They can't drive it into a ditch.  They're -- they're -- they're subject to arbitrary and capricious limitations just as any other agency is.  And to allow Louisiana -- to include what -- what they've allowed in Louisiana to include and to say that the only proof of citizenship -- there is a provision in the statute which says consistent with determining, the States being able to determine the qualifications.  Isn't there a provision which makes it clear that the Federal form has to make allowance for the States determining the qualifications?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now--   Antonin Scalia  --That's true.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the form has to enable the State to do that.  And it seems to me you were quite able to argue that in -- in refusing to allow you to include in the -- in the Federal form in Arizona some indication of proof of citizenship requiring nothing else except oh, I'm a -- check off, I am a citizen, right?  So it's under oath.  Big deal.  If -- if -- if you're willing to violate the voting laws, I suppose you're willing to violate the perjury laws.   Antonin Scalia  So I think you should -- you should have challenged the commission's refusal to -- to place that evidence in the Federal form.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you can say that about any certification procedure that, now and then there will be a mistake.  I mean the fact that there is one person where -- where the computer spit out the wrong number or something, that is the basis for rejecting the entire system that Arizona proposes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Is that conclusive or can that be challenged?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me, they may require it.  It doesn't say they must require it.  So it leaves it open to the Commission, does it not, to decline to require some materials that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility?  Isn't that, isn't that what the language means?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  May means may.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, no, no, we're talking about -- right now we are talking about the consequences of that language, not -- and the consequence of the may is may.  It does not even require the Commission to include within the form everything that's necessary for the State to determine eligibility.  Now, why would Congress ever create such a system where the Commission need not require what's necessary for eligibility, and nonetheless, the State cannot, cannot require anything further than what the Commission says?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It says what you only may require.  It doesn't say what you only shall require.   Antonin Scalia  Is all that stuff required by the Vote America Act?  All that stuff?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just the first thing you mentioned for us.   Antonin Scalia  And the rest is -- is what?   Antonin Scalia  Not anything else that they want.  But what is, in the words of the statute, necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess the eligibility of the applicant?  It's clear that the statute intends the States to be able to do that.  And you say, well, the -- you know, the Commission has -- has required its -- its own proof and the State wants a different kind of proof.  The proof the Commission requires is simply the statement, I'm a citizen.  This is proof?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is not proof at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Under oath is not proof at all.  It's just a statement.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Srinivasan, the problem that I have with that is that the provision you're alluding to says that -- not that the State shall -- not that the commission “ shall ” require the information necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but it simply says that it “ may ” require only that information.  Now, is it conceivable that Congress intended that the Commission may not require some information that is necessary to enable the appropriate State election official to assess eligibility, but that the State may not require it either?  Is that a conceivable disposition of Congress?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You think “ may require only ” means shall require only?  Is that -- is that your submission?  “ May require only ” means shall require only?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It would not be a problem if the State could require it.  It would not be a problem.  When -- when the commission fails to do what enables the State to assess qualifications, the State'll do it.  No problemo.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  And since you believe that “ may require only ” means “ shall require only ”, in judicial review, a determination before the -- the Court would be whether indeed this information is necessary to enable the State to assess the qualifications, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the district court here certainly thought that was necessary.  So you're going to be in -- in bad shape -- the government is going to be -- the next time somebody does challenge the Commission determination in court under the Administrative Procedure Act.   Antonin Scalia  You got to stop saying the Commission approved of it.  2-2 is not approving.  You could say the Commission was unable to disapprove of it.   Antonin Scalia  I'm sorry.   ",12-71XX

I mean, I can understand if -- a finding that a particular case is -- is not filed too late when indeed there was -- there was no time to do it.  But here they -- they had a year.  Why -- why does that undermine the framework?  If and when they don't have enough time, the court can say the -- this suit is not precluded.   Antonin Scalia  So what?   Antonin Scalia  Counsel--   Antonin Scalia  --Well, that's -- that's the internal claims.  Do you know any other instance in which -- when a suit can be brought in -- in Federal court will be determined by an agency?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  An agency saying you've got to sue within 1 year; you've got to sue within 6 years.  Offhand, I can't think of any, and -- and I think it goes well beyond what -- what the Executive is authorized to prescribe.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You know any other instances where -- where a Federal agency has, in effect, prescribed the running of the statute for the courts?

I mean, you can still violate the patent by not having one person do all the steps; have another person do some of the steps.

And you're answering (b).     --Yeah.  I'm sorry.  I was--   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but that is not the tort rule for what this is, which is an absolute liability.  I mean, you asked for the policy reason.  The policy reason is someone who does not even know about the existence of the -- of the patent, who happens to be one of the people who -- who performs one or more of the -- of the steps is suddenly automatically liable.  That's -- that's the policy reason.  It's a strict liability tort.     I think that's absolutely the reason that we -- I think we would all agree that -- that if you had two unrelated parties who each happen to use some steps of a process, happened to perform some steps, unbeknownst to each other, we wouldn't say that those people had used the process in any reasonable construction of the term.   Antonin Scalia  Well, even knownst -- even knownst to each other, but -- but one of them who is knownst doesn't know about the patent.  He would still be liable, wouldn't he?     It depends on what tort principles you would use under 271(a).

I thought it's sort of extraordinary to say Congress can just pick out, we want to hit these eight States, it doesn't matter what formula we use; so long as we want to hit these eight States, that's good enough and that makes it constitutional.  I doubt that that's true.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it happens not to be the method that Congress selected.   Antonin Scalia  If they selected that, you could say they used a rationale that works.  But just because they picked some other rationale which happens to produce this result doesn't seem to me very persuasive.   Antonin Scalia  That's a good answer.  I was hoping you would say that.   INTERRUPTING ",12-96XX
0,"Antonin Scalia  That will always be true forever into the future.  You could always say, oh, there has been improvement, but the only reason there has been improvement are these extraordinary procedures that deny the States sovereign powers which the Constitution preserves to them.  So, since the only reason it's improved is because of these procedures, we must continue those procedures in perpetuity.   Antonin Scalia  Is that the argument you are making?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought that was the argument you were just making.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a different argument.   Antonin Scalia  Hundreds?  Dozens?  What?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Well, maybe it was making that judgment, Mr. Verrilli.  But that's -- that's a problem that I have.  This Court doesn't like to get involved in -- in racial questions such as this one.  It's something that can be left -- left to Congress.  The problem here, however, is suggested by the comment I made earlier, that the initial enactment of this legislation in a -- in a time when the need for it was so much more abundantly clear was -- in the Senate, there -- it was double-digits against it.  And that was only a 5-year term.  Then, it is reenacted 5 years later, again for a 5-year term.  Double-digits against it in the Senate.  Then it was reenacted for 7 years.  Single digits against it.  Then enacted for 25 years, 8 Senate votes against it.  And this last enactment, not a single vote in the Senate against it.  And the House is pretty much the same.  Now, I don't think that's attributable to the fact that it is so much clearer now that we need this.  I think it is attributable, very likely attributable, to a phenomenon that is called perpetuation of racial entitlement.  It's been written about.  Whenever a society adopts racial entitlements, it is very difficult to get out of them through the normal political processes.  I don't think there is anything to be gained by any Senator to vote against continuation of this act.  And I am fairly confident it will be reenacted in perpetuity unless -- unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution.  You have to show, when you are treating different States differently, that there's a good reason for it.  That's the -- that's the concern that those of us who -- who have some questions about this statute have.  It's -- it's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress.  There are certain districts in the House that are black districts by law just about now.  And even the Virginia Senators, they have no interest in voting against this.  The State government is not their government, and they are going to lose -- they are going to lose votes if they do not reenact the Voting Rights Act.  Even the name of it is wonderful: The Voting Rights Act.  Who is going to vote against that in the future?   Antonin Scalia  We looked behind it in Boerne.  I'm not talking about dismissing it.  I'm -- I'm talking about looking at it to see whether it makes any sense.   Antonin Scalia  But that's true in every State, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, you know, I don't think anybody is contesting that it's more effective if you use Section 5.  The issue is why just in these States.  That's it.   Antonin Scalia  All of the noncovered states are worse in that regard than the nine covered states; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Every -- every one of them is worse.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's not just a fair one, it's the crucial question.  Congress has selected these nine states.  Now, is there some good reason for selecting these nine?   INTERRUPTING ",12-96XX
1,"Antonin Scalia  They must allocate?  Is the State saying, You do not own that 30 percent of the recovery, so you never get a property right in it, so that there's never any problem about asserting a lien against it?  I thought that's what's going on here.  And I think that's sort of disguised by talking about allocation.  I thought the State is saying, As to 30 percent of the recovery, you have no property right in it.  Is it not saying that?  Am I wrong?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Maybe you didn't hear my -- my question.  My question is: Is the State saying that you have no property right in the 30 percent?   Antonin Scalia  Let me ask my question again.  Is the State saying that you have no property right in the 30 percent?  I think that can be answered yes or no.   Antonin Scalia  You can bind the parties for other purposes, I assume.  There are other purposes for which the distinction between pain and suffering and medical expenses might make a difference, right?  What if the parties agreed that it's 50/50?  Would the State take 50 percent then, or is the State still limited to 30?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  Don't you think the statute may -- may give you the answer?  It says:  ""Any attorney retained by the beneficiary shall out of the proceeds obtained on behalf of the beneficiary by settlement with, judgment against, or otherwise from a third party by reason of injury or death distribute to the department the amount of assistance paid by the department on behalf of. ""  ""up to 33 percent. ""  It applies to judgments as well as to settlements.   Antonin Scalia  Why?  I don't understand that.  You see, I think the only way you can defend it is that -- is that the recipient never -- never had a property right.  Once -- once recovery is given to the recipient, the recovery does not belong to the recipient.  And if that's true for 33 percent, it can be true for 100 percent.  Has there ever been any litigation since 1935 about takings problems, with -- with the State requiring 33 percent to go to the medical provider, even though it may well be that less or more of that amount went to medical damages?   ",12-98XX
0,"Antonin Scalia  Yes, but that doesn't answer the question.  I mean that portion, according to North Carolina, is one-third.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, but what the State says is the law.  I mean, the State says one-third is for medical.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you need, ultimately you need an adjudication.  You have to leave it either to a jury to decide what percentage of the total award is medical expenses or have a separate proceeding.  Let's say where there has been a settlement, you need a separate proceeding to decide how much of it is really for medical.  You know, they may say 10 percent is, but who believes that?  You need a proceeding.  That is awfully time-consuming.  And as Justice Kagan suggests, I'm not sure it's going to be very accurate.  I don't think a jury determination is going to be -- is going to be accurate on that score.  And I don't know how you go about determining how much of a settlement is attributable to medical expenses versus other things, especially when the settlement itself says only 10 percent is medical expenses.   Antonin Scalia  How do you do that?   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand.  What do you adjudicate?  What is the issue in the adjudication?  How much of the award should have been allocated to medical expenses, or how much of the award was in fact allocated to medical expenses?  Which is the issue?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me it should be the latter, shouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's right.  How much was allocated, right?  It doesn't matter what ought to have been.  The issue is what proportion did the parties in fact allocate to medical expenses, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And they say 1 penny.  How are you going to contradict that?   Antonin Scalia  No, no.  But that's--   Antonin Scalia  --You know, putting -- putting it in the discretion of the court, as you say is done in the workmen' compensation, is quite different from what you're proposing here.  That seems to me quite workable, you know.  The -- the court hears the evidence and he decides how much should be reimbursed within -- within the court's discretion.  But here, you're -- you're asking a court to decide how much of a recovery or how much of a settlement was attributable to -- to the medical portion.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a totally different question.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it would be the defendant who's -- who's -- who's jiggering the system, I mean, not suing for the medical portion simply because the defendant knows that at least some of that portion, if not all of it, would -- would go -- would go to the State.  So, in a situation such as yours where the total recovery is -- is not going to suffice to cover both pain and suffering and medical expenses, it'd be very intelligent to do what Justice Alito proposed.  And that seems to me a real, I don't know, gaming -- gaming of the system.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I have a -- I have a theoretical problem right at the outset.  I mean, what the statute forbids is asserting a lien on recovery that is for medical expenses.  And you're telling me that the States aren't even trying to find out what portion of the recovery was for medical expenses.  They're looking to determine what proportion should have been for medical expenses.  How does that tie in with the -- with the prohibition of the lien?   Antonin Scalia  So -- so you're saying that the State can, in making this determination, in fact take away from a plaintiff who has recovered a -- a greater amount in medical expenses, or a lesser amount in medical expenses, can take -- take away that by determining how much should have been allocated to medical expenses, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're messing up the lien law anyway, no matter which way you play it.   ",12-98XX
1,"Antonin Scalia  You acknowledge that?  See, I wouldn't acknowledge that if I were you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't believe in the parol evidence rule?   Antonin Scalia  Unless, of course, the Yard-Man presumption is normal contract interpretation.  That is, you know, the court of appeals could be saying that when you look at the totality of the contract where the benefits are being given for, as payment for work, you get them if you've worked so many years, they increase when you've worked more years.  Where that is the case, it is a reasonable assumption, call it a presumption if you like, that any promise to pay those benefits continues after the termination of the -- of the union contract.  In other words, I'm not sure that the court of appeals would agree that -- that this presumption is contrary to normal contractual interpretation.  I think the court of appeals would say that is normal contractual interpretation.   Antonin Scalia  But you answered the question.  The answer is yes, right?  The company can terminate.  You're saying it hasn't terminated here, it's a nice company; but it doesn't have to be a nice company, does it?  Isn't that your position?   Antonin Scalia  What I would like to hear, earlier you said there were two reasons: One was the termination clause and second that the contract had to be read in light of the background rule -- then you got cut off.  And I really want to know what the background rule you were about to refer to was.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What's the second one -- before you get cut off again, what's the second one?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I don't think it's reversing that.  I think it's -- it's an argument of -- of contractual expression, contractual intent.  It says if you tie the continuing receipt of health benefits to the continuing receipt of retirement benefits, and if you know that retirement benefits survive the termination of the contract, right?  You acknowledge that.   Antonin Scalia  It seems to suggest that -- that health benefits continue as long as retirement benefits do.  Now, I mean, maybe there are other indications, but that one certainly seems to seems to tie health benefits to retirement benefits.   Antonin Scalia  You know, the nice thing about a contract case of this sort is you can't feel bad about it.  Whoever loses deserves to lose.  [Laughter]  I mean, this thing is obviously an important feature.  Both sides knew it was left unaddressed, so, you know, whoever loses deserves to lose for casting this upon us when it could have been said very clearly in the contract.  Such an important feature.  So I hope we'll get it right, but, you know, I can't feel bad about it.   Antonin Scalia  He agrees with you, doesn't he?  I mean, you're not going to argue that, are you?   ",13-1010

1,"Antonin Scalia  Mr. Goldstein, if I understand your argument, you're saying that there is an obligation to conciliate, but that obligation does not have to be pursued in good faith.

You're saying yes, it can do that in bad faith.   Antonin Scalia  And it can say that in bad faith.   Antonin Scalia  Well, is it correct or not correct?   Antonin Scalia  Because I don't understand your argument.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So fair application of the statute is reviewable, so that the proper -- I mean, we're just quibbling over, you know, how bad it is, that's right.   Antonin Scalia  Can I ask something about this?   Antonin Scalia  Conciliation I thought would be conciliation between the complaining parties and the employer.   Antonin Scalia  But and that's wrong?   Antonin Scalia  Between the EEOC and the employer?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So even if the complaining party is willing to accept $500,000 rather than a million, if the EEOC says a million, the EEOC is conciliated.   Antonin Scalia  Well, no.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, let's go back to the language you quoted.  The commission is unable to obtain an agreement acceptable to it.  To obtain an -- do you acknowledge that it is obliged to try to obtain an agreement acceptable to it--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes.  Now, is it possible that you are trying to obtain an agreement acceptable to you when you do not tell the other side what that might be?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You just say, you know--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You have to make me an offer.  That's not -- that's not difficult to find out.  Did you make an offer or not.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, not necessarily.  I mean, you could--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --draw a line somewhere, but -- but if the other side says the EEOC never made me an offer, I had no idea no notion of what I had to agree to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We don't have adopt a good -- we don't have to adopt a good-faith standard.  We -- we could simply say that if you are really trying to conciliate, there are a few things that you got to do.  And one of them is to make an offer.  Is that difficult to figure out?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Ms. Saharsky, I don't even agree with you about the incentives.  I think, as the other side points out, there is considerable incentive on the EEOC to fail in conciliation so that it can bring a big-deal lawsuit and get a lot of press and put a lot of pressure on this employer and on other employers.  There are real incentives to have conciliation fail.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you disagree that they can publish it in the New York Times if they want?   Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because that isn't credible.   Antonin Scalia  That's not publishing it in the New York Times, is it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That only cuts your own argument.  I mean, you're -- you're worrying about their -- their publishing it, and then you say they have no incentive to publish it.  But if they want it published, they can publish it in the New York Times.  They don't have to bring a lawsuit to do it.   Antonin Scalia  You say that, but it didn't say that it shouldn't be public.  They said it shouldn't be use in court proceedings.  That's quite different from saying it shouldn't be public.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So why do you say the opposite?   Antonin Scalia  That's the world.  There's always litigation over -- over stuff.  I mean, you -- you want to be exempt from any litigation over whether a particular standard has been met or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's extraordinary.  That does not exist in this world.   Antonin Scalia  That is fine.  And if you don't like that, if you're worried number one, this Court could set forth standards one, two, three, four, five; you have to do this, this, this, and this.  I would prefer not to do that.  And if you leave it to the lower courts to do it, each lower court is going to have a different -- a different set of things.  But the remedy for that is -- is at your hands.  As the other side said, you could issue rules which say, this is an informal process, but what it consists of is, number one, we give you notice of what the -- what the offense is; we sit down with you to discuss settlement of that; number three, we make apparent to you what our offer is for settling the matter, and whatever other rudiments of conciliation the agency believes in.  What's wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So if we tell you it's -- it's judicially reviewable -- suppose we just decide it's judicially reviewable and remand for the agency to issue rules?   Antonin Scalia  But I thought Justice Breyer said you have to make the phone call if your letter says it's going to make the phone call.  I thought Justice Breyer believed that there are some rudiments.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We're just talking about what the rudiments are.   ",13-1019
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, it often happens.  It's a jurisdictional issue.  So what's the point?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, the fact that she didn't raise it is irrelevant.  In fact, even -- even if she didn't raise it here, we would have to raise it here, wouldn't we?   Antonin Scalia  Oh, the comity, okay.  And you -- you agree it has nothing to do with the -- with the principal question?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse -- if the -- if the -- would the State be seeking the relief?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The State would be seeking to enjoin its own tax?   Antonin Scalia  Well, but that -- that just means the district court should throw it out.  I mean, I--   Antonin Scalia  --But the statute's addressed to the courts.  And the statute says the courts will not enjoin State -- State taxes.  Now, how -- how can that mandate to the court be altered by -- by private parties?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It seems to me it says that we just don't have the power, period.  But you say the States can give us the power?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that's -- that's fine.  I -- I can understand that.  You say they used to think that it didn't apply, now they're saying it applies.  I agree, that's a good argument.  But you're arguing much beyond that.  You're arguing that it doesn't matter any more because they once said that they wanted the Court to decide it, even though the Court had no power to decide it, right?  I mean, that's a different argument.  It's that one that I criticize.  If you want to say the State's argument seems weaker because they've changed their mind, that's fair enough.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But--   Antonin Scalia  My very point.  So what?  Go ahead.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I'm not sure what -- what you have conceded.  Do you acknowledge that if there were a State law which required in-State sellers not to collect the tax, but just to advise the -- the State revenue service that someone has purchased an item on which tax is due, would you acknowledge that that could be enjoined?  That someone could bring a suit saying, I'm not the taxpayer, this is not the assessment or collection of a tax, and therefore you -- a suit will lie for me to say that this is an unconstitutional assessment or imposition upon me.  Would that suit lie or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, it's -- it's a Federal constitutional violation.   Antonin Scalia  So the only thing that would make the States able to do -- to get information about tax liability without being sued in Federal court is the fact that the person from whom the information is sought is liable for the tax, if the seller has to retain the sales tax.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know what you mean by a third party acting in regard to--   Antonin Scalia  --Oh, of course.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1032
0,"Antonin Scalia  Am I correct that Colorado is the only State that seeks to do this with respect to out-of-State sellers?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That -- that's amazing.  If indeed this is a, you know, a proper operation, why wouldn't all 50 -- in my experience, you know, if it moves, you tax it.  And I--  [Laughter]  I cannot imagine that the other States have not piled on with this thing if it is -- if it is so essential to the tax system and if there are no problems with -- with doing it.  My goodness.   Antonin Scalia  No.  I understand.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But the fact that it's -- it's a one of a kind gives me some pause.  This is certainly a -- a very important case because I have no doubt that if we come out agreeing with you, every one of the States is going to pass laws like this.   Antonin Scalia  And all sellers will also have to be providing this information.   Antonin Scalia  Let's assume I am a not -- not-for-profit -- an unpopular not-for-profit corporation that has members who don't -- who don't want their identity known because hurtful things will be done to them.  And I make a sale which would -- would be exempt from Colorado's laws if indeed it was made by a not-for-profit organization to one of its members.  And Colorado demands from this organization the names of its members.  And you tell me that cannot get into -- I'm claiming a First Amendment objection to turning over the names of my members, and you tell me that cannot get into Federal court.   Antonin Scalia  It can't be that central if no other State has it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How central can it be?   Antonin Scalia  Let's -- let's assume a State law that gives the State taxing authority a lot of money for new computers, and somebody challenges that law on some State ground, whatever it is.  Would that challenge -- on some Federal ground.  Would that challenge not be able to be brought in Federal court because the computers are going to help the tax service to get more delinquent taxpayers and, therefore, you are restraining the collection of taxes?   Antonin Scalia  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can it make the -- the foreign seller collect the tax?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that is sort of strange.  It can't make them collect it, but it -- it has the power to compel them, non -- non-State citizens, out-of-State people, provide the information, assist in the State's collection of the tax?  I don't know why--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I don't know why the one and not the other.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But you know that we accept minuscule, minuscule percentage of appeals from State supreme courts.  And as a practical matter, these challenges in State supreme courts, if they're -- if they're ruled in a manner that -- that violates Federal law, they're not going to come up here -- 90 percent of them aren't going to come up -- more than 90 percent.  So it is important that it begin in Federal court when -- especially when what is at issue is the selfish State's assessment and collection of taxes.  I mean, there is a real incentive on the part of the State government which includes the State courts to, you know, to find the tax not paid.   Antonin Scalia  Well, for collection, yes.   Antonin Scalia  Restrain means impede?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Isn't restrained a synonym for impede?  I -- I thought restrain means to stop.  You restrain somebody, you prevent that person from doing what he wants to do.  But you're using it to mean, you know, whatever impedes the collection of the tax.  It doesn't make it impossible, it doesn't stop it.  It just -- it just impedes it.   Antonin Scalia  It's the means of what -- let's posit a State law that requires all taxpayers to use only a single bank because it will be -- one bank named by the State because it will be easier to levy upon all -- upon all accounts.  It makes it a lot easier for the State.  They just go to that bank and take your bank account.  Okay?  This is challenged as being a taking, okay, and the party tries to get into Federal court with that Federal challenge.  Not possible, right?  Because this facilitates the collection of the State tax and therefore to prevent that facilitation is to restrain the collection of the State tax and therefore the suit has to be brought in State court; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, it is.  That's the whole reason--   INTERRUPTING ",13-1032
1,"Antonin Scalia  I mean, that's lovely, but it doesn't get you around the question that Justice Alito asked, what is the law?  May I make a suggestion?   Antonin Scalia  Perhaps the law -- if you ask somebody what law did Mellouli violate here, it would be perfectly natural to respond by reciting one -- the elements of the law that he violated.  He was convicted of possessing drug paraphernalia to store a controlled substance.  And so also with any other violation of a law that names a number of controlled substances.  If you ask what law did -- did you violate, he would say, I violated the -- the law that made it unlawful to have marijuana or that it made it unlawful to have cocaine.

The definition is, ""A commercial activity carried on in the United States by a foreign state means commercial activity carried on by such state and having substantial contact with the United States."" That sounds to me like -- like the due process test. But what is required here is not just a commercial activity carried on in the United States, it has to be based on a commercial activity carried on in the United States.  And it seems to me that is something -- something added to the -- to the constitutional test.   Antonin Scalia  I suppose it's -- it's -- it's proper to say that where you have negligence that causes an injury, the -- the complaint is based on both. You -- you don't have liability without the negligence. You don't have liability without the injury.  So why can't you say based-on, in -- in that situation, would enable either one to -- to sustain the cause of action?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What provision are you -- what provision are you referring to?   Antonin Scalia  I see.   Antonin Scalia  Can the gravamen be in more than one place?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Pardon me?   Antonin Scalia  Is -- the based-upon language, does it identify a single place, or could it be based-upon activity in -- in two jurisdictions?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Well, it -- it could be based-upon activity in two jurisdiction -- two jurisdictions.  The House Report describing this talks about commercial activities occurring in whole or in part in the United States.   Antonin Scalia  But not in the airline case.  You would not say that the airline case, the gravamen was the negligence in the United States and the injury when the plane landed?   Edwin S. Kneedler  I think, depending on where the tort occurred, it may -- it may just be in the place where the -- where the negligence occurred. But I do want to say that for airlines --   Antonin Scalia  It can't be both?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Oh, it could be -- it could be because the question under the FSIA is whether you can sue in the United States.  Whether you can sue abroad is not determined by based-upon language in the -- in the FSIA. But the -- with respect to airlines, those -- those are covered by the Montreal Protocol which provides a variety of jurisdictions for suits to be brought --   ",13-1067

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Does legislative history support that, too?   Antonin Scalia  Irwin said this was just a presumption, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it said the presumption could be overcome and it made clear that this is a question of what was the congressional intent.  When you put all those three together, of course, you have to look at each statute separately, don't you?   Antonin Scalia  A living Federal Tort Claims Act is what we're talking about here.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  If we were to adopt the position that a statute can change in light of current circumstances, what would that Congress think about it today, would there be any reason to limit that to the Federal Tort Claims Act, that proposition?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We're into judge Calebresi's manner of statutory interpretation, right?   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Martinez, I hate to cut into your time, but it's important to me to understand why you think that if we rule for you, we will not be saying that every statute which allows suit against the Federal government and which uses the words “ shall be forever barred ” will not have to come out this way.  What distinguishes this case from all those others?     INTERRUPTING ",13-1074
0,"Antonin Scalia  It isn't just that phrase.  It's other language that is just lifted verbatim from the two prior Acts.  And you add to that the fact that the purpose of this statute was to eliminate the exception in the Tucker Act for torts.  The--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That was the obvious purpose of it, so they -- they repeat the language of the Tucker Act and say it applies to torts.  One would think that the same limitations that applied to the Tucker Act continue to apply.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it seems to me that is incompatible with what I thought your position was, that it depends upon congressional intent.  So we can just ignore everything you've argued up to here.  It doesn't depend upon congressional intent because we can give those words meaning that the Congress did not give them at the time.  You have to pick one argument or the other.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Are you -- are you going to be bound by -- by what the Congress at the time believed it was enacting or not?   Antonin Scalia  Well, that may well be, but--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Look, there are a lot of statutes, perhaps most statutes, that are not explicit.  That do not use the magic language that you insist this statute have.  And when that happens, we don't just sit back and say, well, in that case, it's up to us.  We don't say that.  We have certain rules that -- that determine what the presumptive intent of Congress was.  And I don't care whether each individual member of Congress or, indeed, any single one of them had that in mind.  They ordinarily don't.  But we have rules, one of which that is very strong, is that when you adopt the language from another statute -- especially when it is in the same area, and this is the same area as the Tucker Act, it is eliminating the Tucker Act exemption for torts.  When you have the same language and it has been -- that language has been interpreted by the courts uniformly over a period of years to mean a certain thing, we will presume that that is what Congress had in mind when it used the language.  Now, if you're asking us to abandon that rule and just sit back in -- in any case when the legislative history doesn't say anything and -- and make up what we think should be the best answer, that simply is not the way we've proceeded.   Antonin Scalia  You think man means women, right?  Never mind.   Antonin Scalia  You know, I don't find the -- the existence of -- of those exceptions, and there are a lot of exceptions, so persuasive, because unlike the Tucker Act, the Tort Claims Act refers to State law, so you have to make exceptions unless you're going to suck in everything about State law, procedures and everything else.  So, you know, it's sort of apples and oranges.  The fact that those exceptions are there are explicable not because Congress didn't think jurisdiction meant jurisdiction in the narrow sense, but, rather, because having referred us to State law, they had to make some exceptions from State law.   ",13-1074
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, it wouldn't resolve the question.  Only -- only perhaps for delegation purposes.  But -- but it doesn't resolve the -- the other issue in the case, which is due process.  That is to say, even if this is a governmental entity, there are some things that governmental entities can't do.  And, indeed, I think that the case law in this area relies on the due process clause more than on the distinction simply between public and private entities.   Antonin Scalia  It was raised.   Antonin Scalia  And it's -- and it's argued here.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  But the statutory preference requirement requires -- would require consideration of whatever is determined by this body, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What must it consider?   Antonin Scalia  I don't -- I don't see how you can say he's an inferior officer.  He's supervised by nobody.  That's what we have held to be the -- the touchstone of principal versus inferior.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's it.  And supervised by nobody.   Antonin Scalia  A limited task is -- is not the touchstone.  I mean, that's what we said in Morrison and we repudiated it in a later case, which said the touchstone of a -- of a principal officer is whether that person is not subject to control by somebody else.  And I don't see how this person is subject to any control in -- in the task that he's assigned.   Antonin Scalia  Let me -- let me talk about regulatory effect.  As I understand it, once these -- what do you call them?   Antonin Scalia  The metrics and standards.  Once they were issued, wow, the -- the on-time record of Amtrak went way, way up.  So they had a very immediate and clear effect on the behavior of -- of the parties.  Now, do you think that because the sentencing guidelines are now just advisory that we could have the sentencing guidelines issued by some private party that -- that is not appointed pursuant to the requirements of the Constitution?  Because after all, they're just advisory.  Now, the reality is, they have a significant effect on -- on the behavior of -- of lower courts.  And I think it's the same thing here.  There's a significant effect.  I don't know--   Antonin Scalia  --Why did the record improve so -- so rapidly and so promptly?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wow, I didn't mean that.  [Laughter]   ",13-1080
0,"Antonin Scalia  That's the big problem here, regulatory authority.  As far as I'm concerned, that's the big difficulty.  Why is this an exercise of regulatory authority when all it does is enable an investigation?   Antonin Scalia  So for -- I mean, for that purpose, what difference does it make whether it's a governmental entity or not, so long as it is operating on a for-profit basis and is giving -- is given the last word on some regulatory matters that disadvantage its competitors, there's a violation of due process.  I -- I don't see how it makes any difference whether you call it governmental or not.   Antonin Scalia  You have to posit that the energy department manufactures bulbs.   Antonin Scalia  And that it keeps the profit from the bulbs on its own.  It doesn't have to go deposit it in the treasury.  So the -- so the -- it is a profit-making entity and it prescribes standards, as Justice Breyer suggested, that harms other people.  That would be a parallel to this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, he said the metrics and standards for the first time made it realistic that there would be enforcement of that requirement.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  I think -- I think you can allow a private party to bring an enforcement action.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, even if they just said an enforcement action shall be commenced if Amtrak requests it.  I think that would be perfectly constitutional.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1080
1,"Antonin Scalia  Counsel, I don't understand the government to be making the argument, and I can't understand why it isn't making the argument, that it doesn't matter whether there was any intent to suppress anti-Bush demonstrations, that in this area, as in traffic stops, we don't consult subjective intent.  If -- if a policeman stops somebody, and it's, oh, you stopped me only because I was coming back from an anti-Bush demonstration, we wouldn't -- we wouldn't listen to that argument.  We'd say, did you have a broken taillight or not?  If you had a broken taillight, we do not inquire into the subjective intent of the officer.  Why is it any different here?   Antonin Scalia  You haven't made it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't even have to get into that.  You don't have to get into clearly established law.  It's a very simple case.  If you say, was there objectively a reason to move these people?  If there was, if you had an ulterior motive that was unconstitutional, we don't inquire into it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't -- what does that answer mean?   Antonin Scalia  I can't understand why you didn't brief it then in that case.  I cannot understand why you didn't brief it.  And -- and talking about things that we haven't -- haven't held in the past, we haven't even held in the past that -- that there is a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation, have we?   Antonin Scalia  Do we have any cases that has held that?   Antonin Scalia  That's not a mixed motive.  Why -- why do you accept the description of that as a mixed motive case?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If you agreed with my hypothetical, the point is it doesn't matter what the officer's motive was.  It does not matter.  If there's an objective basis for a traffic stop, even if his sole motive was discriminatory, the stop is nonetheless valid.  This is not a mixed motive issue.   Antonin Scalia  Then don't -- just don't call it mixed motive.  It confuses everything.  It confuses everything.   Antonin Scalia  You know, I really -- I really don't understand what the government is doing here.  It seems to me you want to win this case, but not too big.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In -- in light of the arguments waived below and the arguments not made here, you want us to find for you, but on the narrowest possible ground.  I would think it is in the interest of the United States and the Secret Service to say there are no Bivens First Amendment actions, but you don't make that argument.  Didn't make it below; don't make it here.  Likewise, it would be in their interest to say, oh, this is just like a traffic stop.  It doesn't matter whether we had a -- a bad motive so long as there was an objective reason, that's the -- but you don't make that argument here either.  I -- I really can't understand what the government is trying to do here.   ",13-115X
0,"Antonin Scalia  Counsel, do you acknowledge that -- that the issue here is whether the law was clearly established?  Do you agree with that?   Antonin Scalia  I'm not saying whether you believe it is.  Is that the -- if you find it wasn't clearly established, do you lose, is what I'm saying?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  Now, how can it be clearly established if we have never held that there is a Bivens cause of action for a First Amendment violation?  We've never held that, have we?  How can you possibly say that the violation here is clearly established.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, it is pernicious.  But is there a Bivens action for it?  The Constitution does not create a cause of action for this.  1983 doesn't cover this.  We invented it out of -- really out of nothing, and we have not extended that to First Amendment violations up to now.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, regardless of whether it was made below, it certainly goes to the argument that was made below and here, that the violation here was not clearly established.   Antonin Scalia  Well, okay.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a good point.   Antonin Scalia  That's a good point.   Antonin Scalia  You're the farthest thing from a security expert if you don't know the answer to that one.  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I don't think the government has conceded that.   Antonin Scalia  I don't think they've ever conceded that at all.   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I'm not sure.  If you stop a car because you think the participants in it were coming back from a protest against President Bush, is that a Fourth Amendment case or a First Amendment case, if that's your allegation?  The only reason the car was stopped was because of the viewpoint of these people.  Is that a Fourth Amendment case?   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, I would think so.  And you think that so long as you make that First Amendment allegation, it doesn't matter if you have a broken taillight.   Antonin Scalia  You wouldn't seek limited discovery; you would see unlimited discovery.  [Laughter]  You might get only limited discovery, but--   ",13-115X

0,"Antonin Scalia  But these statutes do not speak of consolidation of cases, they speak of consolidated proceedings.  Where -- where do you get the notion that the cases have been consolidated?  And if that notion were true, surely the consolidation must terminate when one of the cases is dismissed, how can it still be consolidated when it's dismissed and the other, and the other cases are proceeding.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It makes a big difference.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Waxman, have you made this argument before, did you make this argument in opposition to the petition for certiorari, namely that there was no final judgment here.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But aren't--   Antonin Scalia  --Yes, but that's quite different.  You were defending the proposition, I thought, that the Second Circuit said that there had been no final judgment in this case.  Not in the consolidated cases but no final judgment in this case.  And I don't read that -- that order on -- on Page 2A as saying anything other than that there's not been a final order under -- under 1291 because all the cases have not been disposed of.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I -- that's a very strange way to read that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Given the opinion of--   ",13-1174
0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, why doesn't the -- it seems to me the question for the jury is -- is not whether they look alike, but whether they create the same commercial impression.  And it seems to me the instructions to the jury would say these are the two marks, now what you ought to know is that after the first mark there was a competitor who came into commerce called American Paging, and then the mark was changed from American Mobile Phone to American Mobile Phone Paging.  Do you think that that second mark creates a different commercial impression than the first one?  And I think a jury would say, heck, yes.   Antonin Scalia  Do you think consistency appears in the -- in the judicial opinions that have treated this as a question of law?  I mean, what -- what is the judge -- does he get cases and look at -- look 23 what other cases have said is tackable and what isn't tackable?   Antonin Scalia  Even -- even the ones you -- you point us to do -- do not impress me as establishing any kind of -- look on page 50, dolphin to dolphin, and the second dolphin is stylized in -- in cursive writing, right?  And that is upheld as -- as tackable.  Then on the next page, on 51, the second one from the bottom, it -- it's the opposite progression, turbo in cursive goes to turbo in -- in capital letters and that is not permitted.  I cannot for the life of me decide why the one should be permitted and the other should not be permitted.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And I'd much rather blame it on the jury than on the court.  [Laughter]   ",13-1211
1,"Antonin Scalia  So it can be taken away from the jury you're saying?  If -- if no jury could possibly find tacking appropriate, the Court could issue a judgment as a matter of law.

Antonin Scalia  I mean, you've got to admit there is some predictability.   Antonin Scalia  Would you repeat what you said about the -- the other defenses, laches and what else?   Antonin Scalia  And those are still available on -- on remand?   ",13-1211
0,"Antonin Scalia  Sure, it is.  But if -- if that were the case, why -- why would the statute have to refer separately to dismissals for frivolousness by the district court or by the court of appeals? You could just -- it could have just said, if he's had a petition dismissed for frivolousness period, and that would mean it would have to go all the way up.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It separately says by the district court or by the court of appeals.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think on your theory, he wouldn't get two, he'd just get one.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The -- the dismissal is simply not final until the court of appeals acts, and that's one dismissal.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No.  I understand what you're saying, but it doesn't make any sense.  It doesn't make any sense for Congress to want a finality rule and yet to count it twice.   Antonin Scalia  Why do you say that? Where do you get that out of the word ""occasion""? I would -- I would think ""occasion"" means at any time prior, whether it's at the court -- whether it's at the district court or the court of appeals.  You -- you read it.  Why can ""occasion"" only mean what you suggest? Or mean what you suggest, period?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Mr. Shanmugam, I find it as one of the appealing points in your argument that you have a dismissal for frivolousness at the District Court level.  It's counted as a third strike, and then that is reversed on appeal.  So that, you know, turns out it shouldn't have been the third strike.  And I don't know, what do you do in the last case? In the next case he has only two strikes.  That is a messy situation.  How often does that situation arise? How often is it that a District Court dismisses for frivolousness and is reversed by the Court of Appeals? Do you have any idea?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I hope so, because I don't think it happens very often.   Antonin Scalia  It says the dismissal will not take effect.  Why can't it say the dismissal -- you know, we think you deserve to be dismissed but we'll enter a stay so you can go up and see if we were right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Now, wait.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.  I mean, what's distinctive about yours is you have to wait for the period of the appeal. You have to -- and, you know, that could take a long time.  And you talk about floodgates.  The reason this statute exists is because of floodgates, because these prisoners file one -- one frivolous appeal after another.   Antonin Scalia  Again -- again, that's a big problem depending upon how frequent that is.  If it's once in a blue moon, you know, it's no big deal.

I think what Justice Kagan is saying, it's -- it's a lot harder to say you have dominion and control when you have to come before an equity court and say, Please, may I, you know -- please may I have -- have the gun given to my best friend or to somebody else.

1,"Antonin Scalia  You're -- you're not asking us to resolve the constitutional question, just the question of whether you can raise the Constitution.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but the criminal prosecution isn't all that they're complaining about.  They're complaining about having -- having to be dragged through this same -- this same proceeding next time in the midst of an election campaign, and however minimal the finding that is ultimately made may be, they are going to be subject, for sure, to that proceeding in the next election campaign.  And I don't care if all the commission says is, you know, there is some reason to believe that they were lying.  Even if it's that minimal, you are forcing them, and it is pretty sure that it's going to happen because somebody will complain, the candidate they are criticizing, you are forcing them to go through this procedure in the midst of an election campaign, right?     --Well, with respect, Your Honor, I think there is a couple of answers.  First off, I think it's speculative.  If you look at the complaints, the SBA List complaint simply says they would like to engage in substantially similar activity in the future.  Now, you have to keep in mind what that activity was.  They weren't challenging anybody who voted for the Affordable Care Act.  They were challenging specific congressmen.  At JA-113, it says certain congressmen.  That's in their complaint.   Antonin Scalia  Their organization is not an anti-Driehaus -- is that his name, ""Driehaus""?     Yes, Your Honor.   Antonin Scalia  That's not what they are about.  They are about opposition to the abortion funding portion of the Affordable Care Act and they're going to make the same, the same contentions against anybody else who runs for office who has voted for that Act, whether it's Driehaus or anybody else.     Well, with respect, the people that they targeted in 2010 were only pro-life Democrats who originally voted against the Act and then changed their vote in response to the executive order.  This is at JA-52 when they announced their Votes Have Consequences Bus Tour.  It wasn't against everybody who voted for the Act.   Antonin Scalia  The mere fact that a private individual can chill somebody's speech does not say, well, since a private individual can do it, you know, the ministry of truth can do it.  That's not -- that's not the law.     --Well, the law -- so that's the First Amendment question, it seems to me.  On the standing question, it's whether this harm would have come up -- can't come about absent this law, and the fact that he notified the company that they might be thinking about a defamation action suggests that it's entirely speculative that it would have come about absent this law.   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, what?  I can't understand what that would be.  It has to be really false.  Is that it?  [Laughter]     Well, I think -- I think -- I think Alvarez is completely distinguishable as being about false statements in the abstract.  This Court already held in McIntyre that the State has a compelling interest in policing fraud and liability of statements in the election context because of the risk to the public from those statements.  And Mark Twain--   Antonin Scalia  Do you think that the allegedly false statement here was a false statement of fact?     I think there's a good argument that it was not, that there was a false statement of -- that there's reasonable interpretations of this ambiguous Affordable Care Act, and if so--   Antonin Scalia  There's a good argument on the other side.  But it's an argument over a fact, isn't it, whether this person was responsible for the Affordable Care Act.  I mean that was the charge, you know, that this person made the decisive vote, right, in the--     --Well, that's a different case.  This charge was he voted for taxpayer-funded abortion, was the -- was the charge.  And so it's whether this Act--   Antonin Scalia  --But by voting -- by voting for that Act.     --For the Act, yes.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.     So it's whether the Act covers taxpayer-funded abortion, and that's a complex question that if the court were to -- if the Ohio Supreme Court, through certification, were to adopt the Bose standard, it would suggest that it might not be covered because the Bose standard suggests that speech about an ambiguous topic cannot be false under the actual malice standard.  So this whole -- this whole speech could be, through certification, eliminated and the statute narrowed to cover only false statements of verifiable fact.   Antonin Scalia  And then all you have to do is litigate it.  That's all.  [Laughter]  You -- you make the statement, and then, you know, you can litigate it on the basis of whatever the Ohio Supreme Court says.  Right?     Well--   Antonin Scalia  I mean, let's litigate whether it's factually inaccurate or legally inaccurate, right?  It's a lawsuit.     --So we're talking about the scope of the law, correct?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, we are.  But I mean, we're talking about whether this law imposes limitations upon the freedom of speech.  And if you say whenever you do it, you are going to have a lawsuit, you're going to be hauled before this commission.  You may have a good case, you may not have a good case, but you have to justify yourself to this commission before you can -- before you can make the assertion.     Well, that's not true.  That doesn't happen in every case.  It makes -- you're making it sound like the commission hears every political statement out there.  But it has to be filed by a person, and only one person filed a complaint against the SBA this last time, and he is in Africa now.  So I don't think he'll be filing complaints any time soon.

But -- but to act on the assumption that the courts are going to do what they've been doing is quite different from approving what the courts have been doing.  As I understand the history of these things, there was one side that wanted to overrule Basic and the other side that wanted to endorse Basic, and they did neither one.  They simply enacted a law that assumed that the courts were going to continue Basic.  I don't see that that is -- is necessarily a ratification of it.  It's just an acknowledgment of reality.

Policemen are hired to look like policemen and act like policemen.  And people who argue for the Solicitor General are hired to speak like lawyers and dress like members of the SG's office.  I think that's the difference between a principal activity and something that's postliminary or preliminary.   Antonin Scalia  Just as the employer does not hire somebody to check in, that's not the job.  I want to employ you to check in?  Of course not.

I don't know that the Federal Judiciary is numerous enough to do that, and it's a much more simple rule that the other side presents: Treat all signs the same.  If clutter is the problem, they all clutter.  And you shouldn't -- you shouldn't allow or disallow on the basis of the message.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, Your Honor, it's a simple rule, but I think it's an extremely impractical rule that is going to foreclose experimentation and local solutions to local problems.  Let me give you another example of a town that has some sort of sign restriction, but it doesn't apply that sign restriction to safety signs like ""Children at Play"" or ""Hidden Driveway Ahead"".  If you are going to apply strict scrutiny to those kinds of exceptions, they are probably not going to pass muster unless it's a really watered-down version of strict scrutiny that I think is unfamiliar to the courts.  There is actually a fairly robust empirically--   Antonin Scalia  What is the problem?  You make -- you make your sign limits big enough that those signs will attract attention, that's all.   Eric J. Feigin  --Well, I think towns legitimately should not have to be put to the choice if they want to prevent the proliferation of signs that would cause safety problems--   Antonin Scalia  Or have the town put up the signs, in which case they can be as big as the town wants.  We're just talking about private signs here.   Eric J. Feigin  --Your Honor, I'm not--   Antonin Scalia  So you're you're -- saying every private individual has to have a big sign, ""Children At Play"", right?   Eric J. Feigin  --Well, I don't want to resist too hard the idea that the Government can put up any signs it wants, but I think the reason we think the Government could put up the signs here is not because the Government can say that it can speak on certain topics and private citizens can't, but because of the nature of the signs that are being put up, which means that some work has to be done here by the fact that the types of signs I described are safety signs.  Now, for that kind of exception to strict scrutiny, it turns out there's actually a fairly robust empirical debate about whether ""Children At Play"" signs or ""Hidden Driveway Ahead"" signs actually do enhance safety.  And courts are going to have to make a one-size-fits-all conclusion about whether the state of the evidence, which right now is fairly equivocal, justifies that sort of exception.   Antonin Scalia  I don't see why.  I mean, you say it, but why is it true?  Just make whatever the sign requirement is big enough that any private signs that need to get people's attention will get people's attention.   Eric J. Feigin  Well, I think--   Antonin Scalia  What you say about signs I assume applies to noise as well, right?  If the city has a noise ordinance, it can distinguish between noises for various purposes.  A political sound truck before an election can be given a higher allowance, and, I don't know, a street evangelist given a lower allowance.   Eric J. Feigin  --I don't think that would be permissible, Your Honor.  I think one key here is that the type of exceptions we're talking about, the only types we think should be subject to intermediate scrutiny, are ones that track the safety and nonproliferation rationales for the sign ordinance as a whole.  If the City is advancing a distinction based on the fact that they think political speech or ideological speech is more valuable than, say, religious speech, we think that would be subject to strict scrutiny.

Now, what difference does it make whether that was lawfully admitted because it was a constitutional search or it was lawfully admitted because the remedy of excluding it would not be applied if there was a mistake of law, a reasonable mistake of law?  I mean, the constitutional problem is the admission of this evidence.  And it seems to me whether it's properly admitted because the Fourth Amendment wasn't violated or whether it's properly admitted because the remedy for that violation is not -- is not exclusion of the evidence, you lose either way, don't you?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, we need to if we find, as you urge us to find, that it violates the Fourth Amendment to make the search.  We would then have to -- in order to decide whether this judgment is lawful, we would have to decide whether the remedy of excluding that evidence has to be applied.  And you know the answer to that--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Well, you have.  I mean, you have and you acknowledge that it applies to remedies.   Antonin Scalia  So the most you can get from us is a remand?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Just let the North Carolina law -- court decide whether -- whether the remedy of exclusion should have been--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --That's because -- that's because they would be applying Federal law.

It's a Federal question.  They are not going to -- they are not going to get to that, but you're asking us to invalidate this conviction on the basis of Federal law.  And it seems to me we cannot do that unless there has -- even if there has been a violation of the Fourth Amendment, the remedy must be exclusion of -- of the evidence.  That's a Federal question.  I think we're going to have to decide it.  If we send it back to North Carolina, they're not going to decide it.  Are they?   Antonin Scalia  But you're asking us to reverse it on the basis of Federal law and you're asking us to send it back to a State court which is not going to -- to inquire any further into Federal law, even though Federal law, arguably, you will concede says that even if there is a Fourth Amendment violation, if there's a good-faith reasonable belief that the law was violated, the remedy of exclusion will not be imposed.  That's what the Constitution requires.  And you're asking us to say, oh, no, there's -- there's been a violation of the Constitution and we're going to reverse this judgment, even though we haven't inquired into whether the remedy that -- that you want is required.  And it seems to me -- I don't see how we can do that.   Antonin Scalia  They didn't get Federal law wrong.  Their opinion got Federal law wrong, but their judgment did not get Federal law wrong if indeed a good faith mistake of law does not require the exclusion of the evidence from the trial.  The judgment did not get Federal law wrong if that's the case.   Antonin Scalia  We don't review analyses.  We review judgments.  You're -- you're urging that this conviction has to be set aside.

That judgment can be set aside only if, number one, the Fourth Amendment was not violated or, number two, it was violated, but the remedy does not have to be exclusion of the evidence.  It's -- it seems to me it's your burden to establish not just that the Fourth Amendment was violated, but also that -- that exclusion was necessary under the Constitution.  And it is no answer to say, well, that hasn't been argued.  You haven't argued it.  That's the problem.   Antonin Scalia  Sent it back down for that court to decide the other piece.

Antonin Scalia  That -- that seems to be what it says.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, that applies to all rear lamps, the stop lamp and all the other lamps.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So -- so it has to be plural.  If it's going to apply to the stop lamp and all the other lamps, of course, it would say lamps.   Antonin Scalia  But that includes the stop light and any other lights.  Okay.  A stop light, the turn lights, the back-up lights.  So you had to use the plural for those other provisions.

Antonin Scalia  Ms. Lewin, I -- I thought your position was you couldn't care less if the State Department thinks that this is going to interfere with our relations with the Palestinians, that Congress is entitled to do what it is authorized to do under the Constitution, even when that contradicts -- let's assume they can't recognize a country, but they can declare war on a country, can't they--   Antonin Scalia  --that the State Department has decided to recognize and -- and to be friendly with?   Antonin Scalia  Congress can do that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you say can do the same here.  And -- and the fact that the State Department doesn't like the fact that it makes the Palestinians angry is irrelevant.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In any case, this is not your main point, is it?  You're -- you're being either forced into or willingly yield yourself to arguing that -- against the proposition that if this is recognition, it is invalid.  But your main position is this is not recognition; it just has an effect on on the State Department's desire to -- to make nice with the Palestinians, and your position is Congress has no -- no compulsion to -- to follow that, assuming it can't recognize.   Antonin Scalia  You don't claim that this is recognition.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- I guess there are competing canons here.  I mean, one is, I suppose, that we listen to the State Department on matters of foreign affairs, but I suppose another one is that we do not hold a -- an act of Congress to be unconstitutional and thereby ineffective.  So that seems to me a draw, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  So the State Department says this amounts to recognition, and Congress says whether it does or not, we want -- we want this person to be able to list Israel.   ",13-628X

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And this may be one of them.  So--   Antonin Scalia  --the mere fact that it upsets foreign relations doesn't prove a thing.   Antonin Scalia  Not necessarily.   Antonin Scalia  General Verrilli, if we agree with the Petitioner, we do not have to confront the constitutional question whether the President has exclusive power over recognition.  If we agree with you, we are going to have to grapple with that constitutional question, right?  So maybe you want to talk about it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But if it does, then their argument is going to be it does amount to a -- if it does contradict it, then Congress is making its own judgment about recognition.  You have to confront that.  Are they entitled to do that?  I don't see how you can avoid that question.   Antonin Scalia  War making is an executive function, too.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you see, I -- I pick up this passport, and it says place of birth, Israel.  Do I know whether this person was born in Jerusalem or in -- in Haifa?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So how does it -- how does it advertise to the world that -- that the President is contradicting himself?  All you know is that the person was born in Israel.  It could have been anywhere in Israel.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it is not a communication contained in the passport itself, is it?  You're just saying that -- that this -- this piece of legislation advertises to the world what the situation will be, but -- but you're not compelling the President to -- to say that this individual was born in Jerusalem and we're going to say he was born in Israel, because you can't tell that from the passport.

Now, let's assume in the religion that requires polygamy.  I mean, could -- could I say to the prison, well, you know, okay, I won't have three wives; just let me have two wives.  I mean, you're still violating your religion, it seems to me, if he allows his beard to be clipped to one -- one inch, isn't he?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, religious beliefs aren't reasonable.  I mean, religious beliefs are categorical.  You know, it's God tells you.  It's not a matter of being reasonable.  God be reasonable?  He's supposed to have a full beard.   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  You think on the record that's what his religion would require if he can't have a full beard.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  So maybe we should -- maybe this was improvidently granted.  I don't want to do these cases half inch by half inch.  Let's -- let's take a case that involves a full beard.  I mean, the next -- the next case will be one inch, then one and a half inches, two inches.   Antonin Scalia  You're arguing for all 1/2-inch beards, right?  I mean, I--   Antonin Scalia  --We've got to assume all 1/2-inch beards are -- are okay if -- if God tells you to grow them, right?   Antonin Scalia  Well, really subject -- I mean, whose -- whose burden is that?  I mean--   Antonin Scalia  Is it your position that if, what, 90 percent of other -- of other institutions similar to the one at issue in the case permit the practice that is challenged, it cannot be a compelling interest?  Is that your position?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I understand that.  But I'm asking what is the relevance of the fact that other instances--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Are we going to say whenever an institution comes up here that has a restriction which other institutions of the same type do not have, or at least a large majority of them, it's ipso facto bad?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, why does it have to show a distinction?  It can just say the other States are wrong.  We -- we think this is dangerous.  I don't care what other States think.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait a minute.  So vote more money.  All you have to do is raise taxes.  We're talking here about a compelling State interest.  Bear in mind I would not have enacted this statute, but there it is.  It says there has to be a compelling State interest.  And you're -- you're asking, well, let's balance things; let's be reasonable.  Compelling State interest is not a reasonableness test at all.   ",13-6827

If -- if you're claiming if he escapes, he can shave off his 1/2-inch beard and thereby alter his appearance, and the -- the response is, well, just take a photograph of him before he grows his 1/2-inch beard, why do you need that evidence on that point?  It seems to me it's -- it's obvious.  What prevents you from taking a photograph before he grows the 1/2-inch beard, which can then be distributed to police departments if he escapes?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is not an evidentiary matter at all.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Curran, I'm not sure what your position is.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, let's talk -- let's talk about the first thing you say rescission is affected by.  Okay?  It seems to me that it's -- it's common usage to, for instance, one could say on Election Day you vote by going to the precinct and presenting identification.  Now, that is not how you vote.  That's a preliminary step to your voting, and I think that it's possible to read the “ by giving notice ” as -- as to say where -- where that's the only thing you have to do, as it is for the 3-day cancellation rescission, that's the end of it.  But where there is something else to be done, where you have to return whatever you have received under the -- under the transaction, it seems to me more reasonable to read it as, you know, you vote by presenting yourself at the precinct and -- and offering identification.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, wait, wait, wait, wait.  By notifying in accordance with regulations, it seems to me that speaks to the manner of notifying, not to the consequence of notifying.  And Regulation Z may indeed say what the consequence is, but I don't think that the statute authorizes Regulation Z to say that.   Antonin Scalia  Yes, but -- but in common law you had to give back in what you had received, and you have -- you -- you are urging that the statute creates a system in which a -- a creditor who has a secured interest, simply because somebody comes up almost 3 years later and says, you didn't give me two copies of this particular document, I got only one copy, and even if that's not true, immediately the secured interest is converted into an unsecured interest.  That is a huge difference.  And I find it difficult to believe that that's what Congress intended.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But it -- but it's not too late.  [Laughter]   ",13-684X

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Could I -- could I interrupt before you get to that?  You don't take breaths between sentences.  It makes it hard.  [Laughter]  As I understand your case, you're -- you're drawing a distinction between exercising the right to rescind and obtaining rescission.  Is -- doesn't your case hinge on that?   Antonin Scalia  That -- that the notice is simply an exercise of your right to rescind, but rescission does not occur until there's the exchange that the common law?

Can they reverse one of their fellow judges if -- if the fellow judge does not adhere to that -- I've -- I've never heard of such a thing.   Antonin Scalia  I agree with you, it sounds like legislation to me.  It's a hypothetical that's fanciful.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you're not answering the question, though.  The question is whether you agree with the government that so long as there is something that is clearly within the core, it's not vague.  Do you agree with that or disagree with that?   Antonin Scalia  I suppose you could have a statute that criminalized annoying conduct, right? And according to the government, that would not be unconstitutional, because there's some stuff that is clearly annoying, right?   Antonin Scalia  So that's a perfectly good statute according to the government, yes?   Antonin Scalia  Which means it's up to the jury and juries, you know, don't -- don't have to be clear.  They can be vague.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And if Congress hasn't done it, and it hasn't done it, clearly, it seems to me our job is -- is over.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Other laws.   Antonin Scalia  I don't know what you mean by a judgment exercised based on experience.  What -- what experience do I have regarding these innumerable State crimes? I -- I've not heard any case involving any of those State crimes.  What -- what experience are you asking me to apply?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that's not experience.

Antonin Scalia  Violence by the extortion -- extortee.  I mean, it certainly is not the first --   Antonin Scalia  Is that the Justice Department's position, that other extortion is not covered by the provision?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  If it's just blackmail, you threaten to reveal something about the person's life --   Antonin Scalia  -- that isn't covered.   Antonin Scalia  Threat -- threats or force.   Antonin Scalia  You add or fear.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I mean, fear includes being afraid that some events of your prior life will be --   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So -- so you -- you don't assert that extortion means only the extortion that -- that the mafia might -- you know, pay up or -- or we're going to hurt you.   Antonin Scalia  So you -- you take the position so long as there's some easy cases, the statute can't be vague.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you -- you don't take that position?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought your brief took that position.   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So there's no so much thing as a vague statute.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You're saying whenever the statute is vague, the government loses on the Rule of Lenity; therefore, there's no such thing as a vague statute.   Antonin Scalia  The hardest -- the hardest part of this -- of this test is determining what is the typical case of -- of -- of this particular violation. What is the typical case of extortion? To take one of the four enumerated -- what is the typical case of extortion? You seem to think the typical case is the -- you know, I'll break your leg unless you pay up.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  What interpretation?   Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  She didn't propose it as a construction of the statute.  She said very clearly that this Court could not adopt that, but that Congress could.  She was asked, you know, how Congress could fix this.  That was her proposal about how Congress could fix it --   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We would never say that. We would never say that.   Antonin Scalia  No.  He's saying -- she's saying that you can't tell what the typical crime is, and when you can't tell what the typical crime is, you can't tell what -- what -- what the risk is.

How can we--   Antonin Scalia  --Right, and so your -- your -- your job is to argue that that was an abuse of discretion, because the statute says that they may, right?  They may--   Antonin Scalia  --But the district court's opinion is not -- certainly not circuit law, so I think you exaggerate when you say it establishes bad law for the circuit.  It just doesn't.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The circuit let the district court decision stand, but that doesn't make the district court decision circuit law.   Antonin Scalia  And maybe it was wrong.   Antonin Scalia  I see.  You're just not relying on this case; you're relying on the fact that the district court relied on an earlier case.   Antonin Scalia  We don't know what the Tenth Circuit did.  You say the Tenth Circuit's decision.  The Tenth Circuit made no decision.  It declined to take the case, didn't it?  It may -- the statute says it may, and it said we won't.  And we don't know why they said that.  Even the dissenters in the petition for en banc didn't say, oh, the court was wrong to stand by our earlier decision which you complain about.  No, they said, you know, this was an important issue and we should have taken it.  Now, you're saying we are going to review that decision as an abuse of discretion that you should have taken it.  Right?   Antonin Scalia  Is that right?  It seems to me the statute gives the power to the court of appeals.  It says the court of appeals may decline to take it.  We can't override their judgment not to take it unless there is something unlawful about that judgment.  You give us too much credit, you know, we don't have total power to make decisions, the courts of appeals are supposed to make.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Do you agree with that description of the dissent?  Do you think the dissent said that that was the reason?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  But the dissent didn't say why the court of appeals refused to take the case, did it?  It didn't say the court of appeals refused to take it because it agreed with that prior decision.  It didn't say that, did it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, I guess it's an abuse of discretion whenever we fail to correct a clear error of law on a petition for certiorari.  Right?  And I'm not going to mention any names, but is that the case?  It's an abuse of discretion.  I thought we just had the power to say we don't feel like taking it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, but we would sort of frustrate the statute, wouldn't we?  The statute gives the court of appeals the discretion to decide whether there will be an appeal or not.  And you're saying, oh, no, if they decide there won't be you -- you just reach in, and you have cert before judgment.  I think that's a real frustration of the purpose of this statute, which says these matters, you know, are not all that significant.  So it doesn't come to federal court.  It stays in state court, who cares?  We trust our state courts.  I mean, the whole purpose of the statute is to make this, you know, a quick and dirty judgment.  That's why they don't have to state reasons.  They just say no appeal, or appeal.  And you're saying, oh, no.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, is -- is it the same question whether a particular fact has to be submitted to the jury?  And whether a particular fact-finding by the judge is entitled to deference or are they -- are they the same question?   Antonin Scalia  I didn't think they were.   Antonin Scalia  But to say -- to say -- I don't -- I don't agree with your response to Justice Kagan.  To say that the -- that the fact-finding will be dispositive of the legal question is not to say that it is the same as the legal question, which is what I think you responded.  I don't think it's the same as the legal question.  The legal question is are you liable for violating this patent.  And indeed, it -- it may be that -- that given a particular meaning that is established by a factual finding, the outcome is -- is virtually dictated, but it is not the same.  It is not the same question.   Antonin Scalia  To take what first?   Ginger D. Anders  --SEC, which is the use of size exclusion chromatography in the specification.  I think we agree that it's a fact-finding to say that -- that if you use SEC, then peak molecular weight is produced and that you'd need further calculations to do other things.  The district court then made a legal inference where it said because -- because the specification uses SEC, we know that -- that the patent, in the context of the patents-in-suit -- and this is a quote from the district court's opinion:  ""In the context of the patents-in-suit, the meaning of “ average molecular weight ” must be peak molecular weight. ""  That's a legal inference because it's -- it's taking one part of the document and using it to interpret another part of the document.  The Court in Markman said that that is classic textual analysis, when you look at the patent and you say, this part of the specification tells me something about the claims.  So we think with respect to SEC what the Federal Circuit did was it disagreed with the legal inference that the -- that the district court made.   Antonin Scalia  I guess a deed is a private document that's -- has public effect, right?  It prevents certain people from trespassing on the property that is conveyed, and I suppose that could be construed in the various courts that reach different results.  So the mere fact that -- that this binds the public is -- is not conclusive.   Ginger D. Anders  I think that is right.  And of course in the patent system now, there's a -- there's toleration of a certain amount of disuniformity and I think that is because we generally think that there are other values that -- that supersede that uniformity.  So, for instance, you could have, in the case of infringement, you can have two different accusers in different suits; one makes a better record than the other, and the patent could be held to infringe one product but not infringe another materially similar product.

0,"Antonin Scalia  Well, I thought the Section 5 obligation, gee, it -- it used to require that there that there be no regression in -- in -- in majority black districts.  So if a district went from 69 percent black to 55 percent black, you would be in trouble.   Antonin Scalia  Right.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and they're saying that's all we did.  You know, these -- these districts were underpopulated with respect to other ones, so we had to move new people in them, and we had to do it in such a way that there was still the 69 percent black population that they're used to be in order to avoid retrogression.   Antonin Scalia  Oh, you can say that, but it meant you're -- the only way to be sure you're not doing that is maintaining the same -- the same percentage.  And that's certainly the way the Justice Department, in the bad old days, used to interpret it.   Antonin Scalia  You realize, I assume, that you're -- you're making the argument that the opponents of black plaintiffs used to make here.  They -- they -- they said, you know, by requiring packing of -- of minorities into certain districts, you're reducing their influence statewide so -- you the representatives in -- in other districts can ignore what -- what -- what the minority wants because they're all packed into -- that's the argument the other side used to be making.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And it's valid in both 13 in both cases.  That's your problem.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  You don't -- I thought you agreed with Justice Breyer.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, you're moving them because they're black, and you think blacks will overwhelmingly vote Democrat.  That's why you're moving them, because they're black.  Because we assume blacks are overwhelmingly Democrats.   Antonin Scalia  And how -- how are your clients hurt by that?  It seems to me you have to come up with a client in one of the other districts that would have been, as you put it, more competitive had this packing not occurred.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I assume that's the harm that -- that you're alleging.   Antonin Scalia  I thought the record just showed that you -- you named your plaintiffs by county rather than district.   Antonin Scalia  But some of the districts were unchanged.  The percentage was exactly the same as it was before.  Those are the only districts that your clients were from.  How have they been harmed?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Was that established in the district court, that you have members in all the districts?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The finding of the district court was that you have -- you have members--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --I don't understand what you just said.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I can -- I can accompany my -- my wife to her table when we go to a dinner party, and we're -- we're seated at different tables.  Isn't -- isn't it proper to say I accompany her to the table?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I just gave you an ordinary and natural use.  I accompanied my wife to her table.   Antonin Scalia  You -- you think there's a spatial component to -- I mean, what -- I don't understand why you say it's -- it's not normal usage, unless you say there is a spatial requirement that you -- to accompany somebody, you have to walk a longer distance, and I -- the example I just gave you suggests otherwise.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  To my wife's table.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I'm asking you whether there are multiple possible -- listen, I'm very big on the rule of lenity, but the condition for it is that there be ambiguity.  And accompany means accompany.  I don't see any spatial component to it.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And the rule here is, you know, garbage in, garbage out.  It may be a very foolish statute.  But -- but we apply what -- what Congress thought was not foolish.   Antonin Scalia  20 steps -- 20 steps is horrible enough for Congress to have believed it's enough of an accompaniment?  What?  Half a mile?   Antonin Scalia  I don't insist on a bright-line rule.  I insist on some rule.  What -- what is your -- what is your rule?  Does it have to be outside the building?  Does -- does the bank robber have to take the person as a hostage outside the building?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Except that the statute says  ""both in the course of or in fleeing from. ""  So it obviously envisions an accompaniment in the course of the bank robbery, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The answer is yes, right?   Antonin Scalia  The woman died from a heart attack, didn't she?  That wasn't de minimis.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And -- and part of what frightened her may have been the -- the fact that your client forced her to go from one room to another.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Because that was evident from the rest of the statute, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, all the statutes you cite, they make it clear that -- that you are talking about accompanying over a long distance, kidnapping or whatever else.  But here there's no such indication, and presumably where -- where you have an indication in some statutes, you do not have it here, it presumably does not apply here.   Antonin Scalia  It -- it didn't it didn't make it comparable to murder because the provision itself says that the -- the accompaniment shall be -- a person accompanied shall be in prison not less than 10 years or if death results, shall be punished by death or life in prison.  So it's -- you are talking 10 years.   Antonin Scalia  Which -- which statute was your client prosecuted under, the old one or the current one?   Antonin Scalia  Yeah, well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --How do I know Congress considered it equivalent to kidnapping?  How do I know that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, I don't know it at all.   INTERRUPTING ",13-9026

Antonin Scalia  Step over there or I'll blow your head off is what he says.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Of course that was unconstitutional, right?  The -- imposing the death penalty for this.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  For even even kidnapping, you know, taking the person away when you're fleeing.  It was unconstitutional to apply the death penalty, so we really don't -- don't have to take that into account, I suppose.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, if we were going to apply it I guess what we would apply is was there significant fear or trauma induced?  I mean, that's] that's what the statute's about.  Threatening people, causing them such excitement that they may have a heart attack, as happened here.  I don't know that the distance is what is de minimis.  It's how much you put the person in fear, I suppose.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It's a very bad statute.   ",13-9026
1,"Antonin Scalia  But you say you can't use it in this case.  You say that that factor renders the -- the giving of reasons inadequate.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I'm surprised that -- that you're willing to accept that there does not have to be a reason or a number of reasons that -- that the city council agrees on, that, you know, seven members of the city council, each -- each one of them has a different reason, and that's okay.  Do you think that that's what the statute means?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  But one can interpret the statute as demanding that they have a reason.  Now, to be sure, that's contrary to normal legislative action.  Congress doesn't have to have a particular reason for a statute.  Every every congressman can have a different reason, and it's still valid.  But I -- I would read this as saying the city needs to -- when it denies, it has to have a reason for denying.  I don't -- I don't know how else you read it.   Antonin Scalia  But doesn't the Administrative Procedure Act require providing reasons when -- when there's a grant or a denial?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Yes.  And we agree that reasons are required.  The question Justice Breyer was asking was what if you don't have a majority in -- in support of any particular rationale, and the response is we've cited some cases in footnote 6.   Antonin Scalia  Don't -- don't you have to give the reasons with the decision under the APA?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Yes, but--   Antonin Scalia  So how can you give it if -- if there is no majority for any single reason?   Ann O'Connell Adams  --You would just -- you would give the rationales of each individual council member.  This is not -- it's not a problem that's unique.   Antonin Scalia  Has this Court ever held that?  Because I would never hold that.   Ann O'Connell Adams  No, no.  It's not a--   Antonin Scalia  It's absurd.   Ann O'Connell Adams  --Justice Scalia, we cited some cases in footnote 6 of our brief that indicate that other courts have allowed that to occur.   Antonin Scalia  Is it just a legislative body?   Ann O'Connell Adams  --No.  In this case, we think it's acting sort of as a--   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  I would -- I would consider this as an adjudicative body.   Ann O'Connell Adams  --Right.  It's it's not making laws that would apply prospectively, but taking a -- a specific ordinance that already exists and applying it to the facts of this case.  But in any event, that is the one thing that we think the statute does require local governments to do that could be different from its normal procedure, is to give reasons.   Antonin Scalia  Do you think that--   Antonin Scalia  --I think Justice Kagan is not disagreeing with you.  She is saying, yes, reasons must be given.  And reasons are given if there's just this exchange in which a congressman -- a councilman expresses a certain fondness for a particular view.  What -- what is the big deal of requiring either that the full council give its reasons or if you think it's enough that different councilmen have different reasons, each councilman say, I am voting against this for this reason?  What is the big deal about that?   Ann O'Connell Adams  --There is certainly not a big deal about it.   Antonin Scalia  Especially since you're making the council do the same thing.  You're making them give reasons, right?   Ann O'Connell Adams  Right.   Antonin Scalia  So why not say you have to spell the reasons out?   Ann O'Connell Adams  I think the -- that is part of substantial evidence review and part of Chenery, that the reasons have to be clear.  That's not part of our test.  It's inherent in substantial evidence review, and we do think the statement has to be sufficiently clear to conduct substantial evidence review.   ",13-975X

I thought they were given 30 days to decide whether -- whether to go forward or not and you're saying it's enough if before the 30 days has totally expired, they -- they can figure out what the city council decided.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I don't understand -- I don't understand what you're saying, it requires a written decision.  Okay.  And the city council here issued a written decision to the phone company saying, we have decided to deny your request.  Now -- and you're saying that is not a written decision, you have to wait until the minutes are written up.  So, what, were they lying when they said, we've decided?   Antonin Scalia  And it's ineffective unless that exists.  So that what was given here in writing was not a decision, but what?  A we intend to decide when the minutes are finally written?  A prediction?  What was it then--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --that the phone company got?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It hasn't been denied yet.  You're saying it's not denied until the minutes are written--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --which is, you know, God knows when.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, you shouldn't send anything out then because according to you, there has been no decision.  You shouldn't send out a notice that we've decided.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what you ought to do.   Antonin Scalia  Well, they said that before the vote.  We don't know why they voted.  What -- what's the big deal of having a city council say, we deny this request for the following reasons: One, two, three?  That would be very clear; there'd be no problem at all.   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, you you spoke of the -- the statutory requirement of a denial letter.  Where -- where is that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Right.   Antonin Scalia  That's not the denial letter.  That's what you're referring to as the minutes.  You say it's the minutes that comply with that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Yes, and constitute it.   Antonin Scalia  There's no requirement of a notification letter, whatever.  There's just that provision that any decision shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence.  So why are you imposing this obligation of a denial letter on these poor, ignorant council members?  [Laughter]   Antonin Scalia  I'm taking it as it's written.  You're making up a denial letter.  There's -- there's no requirement of a denial letter.  So if, indeed, the decision is the minutes, you -- you don't have to do anything until the minutes are published.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I suppose you have to give a copy of the minutes to -- to -- to the loser.   Antonin Scalia  Everybody else like you thinks that there has to be a denial letter, right?

1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, that was an assault at common law, wasn't it?  If you threatened somebody with violence and don't actually apply violence, it's still an assault, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, you wouldn't go along with that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that would cover the situation in which somebody transmits in interstate commerce a warning that Al-Qaeda going to assassinate a certain person.  That is technically covered by this -- by this statute, isn't it?  ""Whoever transmits interstate any communication containing any threat to kidnap any person or any threat to injure the person of another. ""  this -- this contains a threat.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The -- the threat of Al-Qaeda, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  So you're back to what the intention of the sender is.  That statement eliminates the intention of the sender, doesn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  Well--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --Exactly.  That's a big difference, and -- and I had thought that your position took account of that difference, that you had to intend to place somebody in -- in -- in fear.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Once you eliminate that, you -- you can accept Justice Breyer's position.   Antonin Scalia  Well, wait.  Before -- before you depart from -- from your -- your view, I had understood that to be your view.  But if I understand it correctly, when you have this disaffected divorced husband who wants to place his former wife in fear, he doesn't call her up, but a friend of his who knows about his malicious intent calls up the former wife and says, you know, your former husband has threatened to kill you.  Now, why wouldn't that meet all of the -- all of the requirements that you insist upon, knowing that this would cause fear in her?  The only thing missing is it is not his purpose to cause fear in her.  But once you depart from that purpose, you -- you open the door to a situation like that which, it doesn't seem to me, should be covered.   Antonin Scalia  I'm -- not no, no.  I'm not prosecuting him.  I'm prosecuting his friend who calls the former wife and says your -- your former husband has threatened to kill you.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He doesn't -- it's not his purpose to put her in fear, but it certainly puts her in fear.  Any reasonable person would think it puts her in fear.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Exactly.  He does not have the purpose of putting her in fear.  So you're back to purpose, which you keep denying, and I don't -- I don't see how you can--   Antonin Scalia  --get to where you want to be without -- without putting purpose in there.   Antonin Scalia  It's better -- it's better, but not good enough.   Antonin Scalia  Counsel, you--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --You really have me confused at this point.  Your previous statement relied upon that case and the Wharton by saying it requires an intent to cause fear.  I did not understand that to be your position.  I thought your position is you do not need the intent to cause fear.  It's enough if the reasonable product of this statement is to cause fear--   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  --and you know that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you know that.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's not an intent to cause fear.  It's just a knowledge that fear will ensue.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And this is valuable First Amendment language that you think has to be protected, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The kind of things that -- that were quoted earlier, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It has to reasonably put somebody in fear.  That's -- that's all the government's insisting on.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It may be a low standard, but to my mind it doesn't eliminate a whole lot of valuable speech at all.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It eliminates a lot of valuable speech.   Antonin Scalia  That would be for the jury, I assume.

I think that's rather unusual.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Even -- even in the heat of -- of anger.

Antonin Scalia  So if -- if they came in and said both are true, the first has to -- has to have been true.   Antonin Scalia  I didn't read that as being a part of your case here.   Antonin Scalia  Well -- well, the -- the ""or"" would have been accurate, wouldn't it have?   Antonin Scalia  That -- that -- that's what your case comes down to: Failure to instruct the jury that they had to be unanimous as to both?   Antonin Scalia  It isn't a harmlessness argument.  It -- it's an argument that the jury was told you can convict if A plus B.  They came back and said, beyond a reasonable doubt, A plus B, he's guilty. And now you come and say, well, you know, he really wasn't guilty on B.  There wasn't enough evidence. That's okay.  He's still guilty on A.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I -- I just don't see how you get around that.   Antonin Scalia  Of course, this --   Antonin Scalia  -- this case is even -- is even worse than the hypothetical that Justice Alito posits in that -- in his hypothetical, Count II was a real count.  In this case, the equivalent of Count II in the hypothetical was not real at all.  It was a misinstruction which you did not object to.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's a -- that's a -- that's a rule that will have application in a lot of other situations.  You're saying whenever an error can be raised on habeas, we -- we should accord -- no matter that it's been waived, no matter what else exists, we should allow that point to be raised in initial review.   Antonin Scalia  Well, why -- why wouldn't it? I mean --   Antonin Scalia  Why doesn't it follow?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's your argument: Since it can be raised in habeas, why not do it now?   ",14-1095
1,"Antonin Scalia  You know, I -- I have a -- sort of a threshold question on that.

I don't know what the plain error is if it's -- if it's not jurisdictional.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In which case there would be plain error.

Antonin Scalia  It still in all doesn't make any sense to say we're going to let him off on habeas because of inadequate assistance of counsel who failed to raise the statute of limitations and yet he cannot raise that point on appeal --   Antonin Scalia  -- on direct appeal.  Make him go through -- why? Why -- why make the society incur more expense, make him probably languish in jail when he's going to -- going to get out on habeas?

You pick the one that will do all the things that you say.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But, but -- if -- if it can only reasonably mean one thing, it will continue to mean that one thing even if it has untoward consequences for the rest of the statute.  No?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Answer me in principle.  I mean, is it not the case that if the only reasonable interpretation of a particular provision produces disastrous consequences in the rest of the statute, it nonetheless means what it says.  Is that true or not?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I disagree with that. You have a single case in which we have said the provision is not ambiguous, it means this thing, but, Lord, that would make a terrible statute, so we will interpret it to mean something else.  Do you have one case where we've ever said that?   Antonin Scalia  What about -- what about Congress? You really think Congress is just going to sit there while -- while all of these disastrous consequences ensue. I mean, how often have we come out with a decision such as the -- you know, the bankruptcy court decision? Congress adjusts, enacts a statute that -- that takes care of the problem.  It happens all the time.  Why is that not going to happen here?   Antonin Scalia  I -- I don't care what Congress you're talking about.  If the consequences are as disastrous as you say, so many million people without -- without insurance and whatnot, yes, I think this Congress would act.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  This is not the most elegantly drafted statute.  It was -- it was pushed through on expedited procedures and didn't have the kind of consideration by a conference committee, for example, that -- that statutes usually do. What -- what would be so surprising if -- if, among its other imperfections, there is the imperfection that what the States have to do is not -- is not obvious enough? It doesn't strike me as inconceivable.   Antonin Scalia  There were senators, were there not, who were opposed to having the Federal government run the whole thing, because they thought that would lead to a single-payer system, which -- which some people wanted.  And the explanation for this provision is it prevents -- it prevents the -- the Federalization of -- of the entire thing.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's -- that's certainly a plausible explanation --   Antonin Scalia  -- as to why the provision is there.   Antonin Scalia  Well, you're -- you're putting a lot of weight on the -- on the -- one word, such, such Exchange.  Such -- it seems to me the most unrealistic interpretation of ""such"" to mean the Federal government shall establish a State Exchange. Rather, it seems to me ""such"" means an Exchange for the State rather than an Exchange of the State.  How can the government -- Federal government establish a State Exchange.  That is gobbledygook.  You know, ""such"" must mean something different.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  The word ""such"" means not -- not just the Exchange that the State was supposed to set up, but it means the State Exchange.   Antonin Scalia  No.  You -- you have to say it means the State Exchange.

I think something prevents that.  And whatever prevents that would prevent it on the license plates, too.  No?

And so he -- you know, he supplies that, but he --   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  -- doesn't say --   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  He doesn't say that it's necessary to his decision.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  No, you -- you -- you have to establish that it's error --   Antonin Scalia  -- before they have to establish that it's harmless.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  But -- and what Justice Breyer was saying is it wasn't error.  He's just speculating, trying to make sense of the whole thing, but that wasn't the basis for his decision. You have to establish that it was the basis for his decision, whereupon there is error, whereupon the State has to show that it's harmless.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, again, that -- that -- that depends on what you mean by error.  If -- if all they mean by it was error that you should not bring in, in your opinion, any -- any facts that are not on the record, it's a mistake to do that -- I think that's what they meant by it was error.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That doesn't make any sense.  You're saying that the -- what -- the Illinois Supreme Court thought the opinion below was, was that the judge didn't think eyewitness testimony proved that this was the guy who -- who hit him with a baseball bat. But nonetheless, he thought this guy was a drug dealer and that will be enough.  I -- that doesn't make any sense.  The trial court must have accepted the credibility --   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  -- of one or both of -- of the witnesses.   ",14-1516
1,"Antonin Scalia  Well, wait --   Antonin Scalia  Why did -- why did the Fifth Circuit treat this, therefore, as a -- as it requested review the sua sponte extension granted below?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Why -- why would it have done that if it -- if it thought that, in fact, there was some argument about whether -- whether they could appeal the denial of extension in law as opposed to in the sua sponte discretion of the agency?   Antonin Scalia  Why? Why would one do that?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which means there -- there's no equitable tolling.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Sure.   Antonin Scalia  Do you acknowledge that if -- if you view this as the Fifth Circuit viewed it, as a request to review the sua sponte extension granted by the agency, that the Fifth Circuit would have had no jurisdiction over that?   Antonin Scalia  I'm not sure -- did the First Circuit say it has no jurisdiction to review the -- the statutory question?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought all it did was, since there is no tolling under the statute, we're going to interpret this as a sua sponte thing, and the only question before them is whether that sua sponte thing conferred jurisdiction or not.  Isn't that what happened?   Antonin Scalia  Okay.   Antonin Scalia  It's a good question, though. (Laughter.)   William R. Peterson  Thank you.  When the Fifth Circuit in Ramos-Bonilla adopted the second half of -- adopted construal rule from Lin v. Mukasey, we think the Fifth Circuit necessarily adopted the premise for that construal rule as well. So when the Fifth Circuit quotes Lin v. Mukasey for the proposition that an argument seeking equitable tolling is in essence an argument that the BIA should have exercised its discretion to reopen sua sponte, we think that Ramos-Bonilla necessarily adopted Lin's premise of that, that equitable tolling is not a basis for filing an untimely or numerically barred motion.   Antonin Scalia  So -- so you -- you say the Fifth Circuit did not implicitly hold that there was no review of -- of the statutory deadline period --   William R. Peterson  As we understand --   Antonin Scalia  -- because you think the Fifth Circuit read the -- the board's decision, since it came after the 90 days, to be a sua sponte decision and, hence, nonreviewable. But that's not consistent with their earlier decisions, which said, we're going to interpret it this way because we have no jurisdiction to do it if you interpret it the other way. I mean, they didn't say that, if it's after the 90 days, the -- the board should consider it to be an appeal to its sua sponte authority.  They said, since we believe that -- that there is -- that there is no extension of the 90-day period under the statute, in order to help the Petitioner, we're going to interpret it as a request for review of the sua sponte authority. Isn't that -- isn't that what they said.   William R. Peterson  Yes, Your Honor, but we see the two as essentially indistinguishable.  Because the Petitioner's request came after the expiration of the 90-day period, it could have been granted only through the board's exercise of its sua sponte authority.  And a decision whether to grant or deny the board's exercise of its sua sponte, in our view, is unreviewable. Let me point out one possible concern in writing an opinion here.  And that's the habeas context. As the Court's aware, prisoners can be quite creative in attempting to circumvent the bar on second or successive petitions under 2254 and 2255 and will frequently file motions captioned under 2241 or possibly obscure common law writs, seeking relief that's properly available under 2254 or 2255. In those circumstances, the district courts will properly look at the merits of petitioner's request, determine that it is a request that could truly be granted only under 2254, 2255, and whatever the caption the prisoner has placed on it will enforce AEDPA's jurisdictional bar. And finally, with respect to merits of equitable tolling, we would simply note that, in our view, Justice Ginsburg, I believe the Fifth Circuit has already determined that Petitioner's motion to reopen was untimely.  And in the event that the Court remands to the Fifth Circuit without addressing anything other than the jurisdictional question, the inevitable result in the Fifth Circuit would simply be to deny on the merits, which is a result that would not lead to any greater benefit for Petitioner. If there are no further questions.   ",14-185X

0,"Antonin Scalia  It wasn't criminal at the time -- I mean, it wasn't prohibited by the Constitution at the time he was convicted, right?   Antonin Scalia  I thought that the -- the case it cited said that.  I thought it cited an earlier Louisiana Supreme Court case which made it very clear that it was following the Federal rule as a matter of discretion and not because -- not because it had to, and it could in a later opinion decide not to follow Federal law.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I thought -- I thought it's unless they clearly state otherwise, we will assume that they're applying Federal law.  And here they did clearly state otherwise.  They said, we don't have to follow Federal law, but we're going to model our State law on Federal law.  It seems to me that satisfies the -- the exception requirement of -- of Michigan.   Antonin Scalia  Well, they did say that here.  They said that this is a matter of State law; we don't have to follow Teague, but we choose to as a matter of State law.  I thought that's what they said.   Antonin Scalia  Mr. Plaisance, on the jurisdictional point, let me see if I understand what you're arguing.  A lot of State rules of procedure are modeled after Federal Rules of procedure, and a lot of State courts simply follow the Federal Rules.  But they follow it as a matter of choice and not because they think they're bound by the Federal rules. So let's say that there is a disagreement in Federal court about what Federal Rule of Evidence 403 means.  The State court says, well, you know, we're going to follow the Federal rule, and we think that the right course as between these two divergent Federal courts of appeals is the Second Circuit.  So we're going to follow the Second Circuit's interpretation of Federal rule 403.  What -- would we have jurisdiction to review that decision as -- as a decision on a question of Federal law?   Antonin Scalia  They changed their mind. They have now chosen the course not to follow our jurisprudence.  What forces them to stay where they were? It's a matter of State law.  They've decided we're going to change State law.   Antonin Scalia  Well, not yet, but if we agree with you and then we send it back and they look at it and say, oh, if that's what Teague means, we're not going to follow Teague, what stops them from doing that? And doesn't that make us look foolish?   Antonin Scalia  We rule decisions that can be overruled by somebody else.

In -- in Standard Oil, the -- this is a quote from the opinion, ""the relationship between post exchanges and the government of the United States is controlled by Federal law.""   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, that would have been true no matter what the State did, right?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  We're deciding a question of Federal law that would have applied on its own.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  In the provision I just quoted, it said that the relationship between post exchanges and the United States is controlled by Federal law.  That's what our opinion says.

1,"Antonin Scalia  Is it the Eighth Amendment or is it due process?   Antonin Scalia  That steams like a -- a language that is relevant rather than the cruel and unusual punishments language.   Antonin Scalia  Don't you think individualized consideration is required even in the non-capital cases?   Rachel P. Kovner  Absolutely, Your Honor.  So I think --   Antonin Scalia  It's really a due process consideration, isn't it?   Rachel P. Kovner  I think due process encompasses that requirement of individualized consideration. Just to address several of the points that came up during Petitioner's argument, I think -- as to the question that Justice Kagan asked about whether, when defendants are simply pointing the finger at each other, that would necessitate severance.  I think that's the question that the Court addressed in Zafiro, where that was essentially the claim the defendants were making, that we're both going to point the finger at each other at trial.  And the Court said that doesn't necessitate severance; that that may, in fact, increase the jury's ability to reach an accurate verdict, to reach an accurate assessment of relative culpability, and enhance fairness.  So we don't think that that's a situation that would require severance.   Antonin Scalia  You -- you would need two -- two separate juries, wouldn't you? I mean --   Rachel P. Kovner  That's -- that's what the Kansas Supreme Court said here.  And the result of that is -- is going to be that two different juries confronted with the very same aggravating circumstances in largely parallel mitigation cases may simply weigh factors like mercy differently.   Antonin Scalia  But wouldn't -- wouldn't the second jury have to know the facts relevant to mitigation, as well as aggravation, I suppose, that came out in the main trial?   Rachel P. Kovner  It's -- it's certainly possible, Your Honor, that if there was a second jury, the government could simply introduce, for instance, the evidence of Reginald Carr's statement to his sister at the second trial.  So you're introducing this disparity that Justice Kennedy alluded to between the defendant who goes first and the defendant who goes second.   Antonin Scalia  Did the Kansas Supreme Court read these cases?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  How can you explain it if -- if indeed our prior cases are so clear on the point?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  They don't like the death penalty.   Antonin Scalia  I -- I suppose the issue is not what they believe, but what they said.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, we -- we -- we don't psychoanalyze the lower courts; we -- we look at what they said.  And if they said that it's the Eighth Amendment, it's the Eighth Amendment.   Antonin Scalia  You -- how can you retroactively give an instruction? Right?   Antonin Scalia  Do -- do you have retention elections in Kansas?   Antonin Scalia  Yes.  And the fact -- how -- how many people are there on death row in Kansas?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Which would suggest that -- that Kansans, unlike our Justice Breyer, do not think the death penalty is unconstitutional and indeed very much favor it, which might suggest that a retention election that goes before such people would not come out favorably for those justices who create Kansas law that -- that would reverse these convictions. I'm just speculating, of course.   Antonin Scalia  It is such common sense that there is a maxim of interpretation that invokes it. When -- when somebody says interest-free loans for people with good credit, it implies that there are not interest-free loans for people who don't have good credit.  Inclusio unius, exclusio alterius. And if one says there are aggravating factors and mitigating factors, and you must prove the aggravating factors beyond a reasonable doubt, the normal understanding is you don't have to prove it beyond a reasonable doubt for the mitigating factors.

So what -- what do you think are the -- are -- are the factors that would suggest the jury would have come out a different way had the rule that you urge been adopted? What -- what specifically? One is the shackling of the -- of the co-defendant?   Antonin Scalia  Now, wait a minute. You're -- you're representing the brother who was the alleged corrupting influence, right?   Antonin Scalia  The corruptor was sentenced, by the same jury, to death.  So how could it possibly be that without the corrupting action of your client, the jury would have sentenced your client to life even though the corruptee was sentenced to death? That doesn't seem to me at all likely.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Let me -- let me put the crime to you.  You tell me which of these descriptions of the -- of the crime are -- are incorrect.  These two men broke into a house in which there were three men and two women.  They ordered the five to remove their clothes, forced them into a closet.  Over the course of three hours, they demanded that the two women perform various sexual acts on one another.  They demanded at gunpoint that each of the three men have sexual intercourse with both women. Then Reginald drove the victims one by one to various ATMs to withdraw cash.  Jonathan raped or attempted to rape both women twice, and Reginald raped Holly G., who later testified, once.  Placing the three men, still naked, in the trunk of one of their cars, the cars drove all five to a soccer field, forced them to kneel in the snow, and shot them execution-style in the back of the head. One of them, fortuitously, was not killed because -- I think it was a hair clip that she was wearing deflected the bullet.  And she is the one who testified to all of this activity. And you truly think -- oh, and they ran over her too.  After shooting her in the head, the car ran over her. You truly think that this jury, but for the fact that your client was a corruptor, would not have imposed the death penalty?   Antonin Scalia  But it --   Antonin Scalia  But it has to have been harmless inasmuch as the person who was influenced by your client also got the death penalty.  How can you say that what made the difference was the fact that your client was a corrupting influence upon his younger brother?   Antonin Scalia  I doubt whether that is the key.  You really think that that's the only thing the jury is going to be focused on, is who pulled the trigger? My Lord.   Antonin Scalia  I don't understand the point you're getting to.  What -- what is your point? That this was -- this decision was based on State law?   Antonin Scalia  Of course, you know, if they didn't read our Eighth Amendment cases, maybe they also didn't read Michigan v. Long.  I mean, that's entirely understandable.   Antonin Scalia  Don't you -- don't you think it's -- it's sort of hard to contemplate each juror -- each juror's ability to find mitigators on his or her own without regard to whether others find the same mitigator? Isn't that somewhat incompatible with -- with the juror's belief that the juror had to find it beyond a reasonable doubt? My goodness, if it's beyond a reasonable doubt, you would think every other juror would find the same mitigator, and they were expressly told that they don't have to find the same mitigator.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Where are you quoting from?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Oh, the Gleason.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Wait.  It's not a matter -- we're asking the factual finding of whether the mitigator existed, not weighing the mitigators against the aggravators, the factual finding of whether the mitigator existed, whether indeed this defendant had a troubled childhood or whatever else.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Can't you say that at least in this case where -- where the State court's interpretation flouts well-accepted, universal contract law principles, the most important of which is you interpret a contract in a manner that makes it valid rather than invalid.

INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  For millennia, not -- not a single other society until the Netherlands in 2001, and you're telling me they were all -- I don't know what.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, the -- the issue, of course, is -- is -- is not whether there should be same-sex marriage, but who should decide the point.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  And you're -- you're asking us to -- to decide it for this society when no other society until 2001 ever had it.  And how many States have -- have voted to have same-sex marriage or their legislature or -- or by referendum? I think it's 11, isn't it?   Antonin Scalia  Well, yes, that -- the State courts who agree with you.  But once again, that's not the people deciding it.  It's -- it's judges deciding it.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I didn't understand your answer.   Antonin Scalia  Miss -- Miss Bonauto, I'm -- I'm concerned about the wisdom of this Court imposing through the Constitution a -- a requirement of action which is unpalatable to many of our citizens for religious reasons.  They are not likely to change their view about what marriage consists of.  And were -- were the States to adopt it by law, they could make exceptions to what -- what is required for same-sex marriage, who has to honor it and so forth. But once it's -- it's made a matter of constitutional law, those exceptions -- for example, is it -- is it conceivable that a minister who is authorized by the State to conduct marriage can decline to marry two men if indeed this Court holds that they have a constitutional right to marry? Is it conceivable that that would be allowed?   Antonin Scalia  But -- but right to this day, we have never held that there is a constitutional right for these two people to marry, and the minister is -- to the extent he's conducting a civil marriage, he's an instrument of the State.  I don't see how you could possibly allow that minister to say, I will only marry a man and a woman.  I will not marry two men.  Which means you -- you would -- you could -- you could have ministers who -- who conduct real marriages that -- that are civilly enforceable at the National Cathedral, but not at St. Matthews downtown, because that minister refuses to marry two men, and therefore, cannot be given the State power to make a real State marriage.  I don't see any -- any answer to that.  I really don't.   Antonin Scalia  They are laws.  They are not constitutional requirements.  That was the whole point of my question.  If you let the States do it, you can make an exception.  The State can say, yes, two men can marry, but -- but ministers who do not believe in -- in same-sex marriage will still be authorized to conduct marriages on behalf of the State.  You can't do that once it is a constitutional proscription.   Antonin Scalia  He's not being required to officiate.  He's just not given the State's power, unless he agrees to use that power in -- in accordance with the Constitution.  I don't -- seems to me you have to -- you have to make that exception.  You can't appoint people who will then go ahead and violate the Constitution.   Antonin Scalia  Because it was a State law. That's my whole my point.  If it's a State law, you can make those exceptions.  But if it's a constitutional requirement, I don't see how you can.  And every State allows ministers to marry people, and their marriages are effective under State law.  That will not be the case if, indeed, we hold, as a constitutional matter, that the State must marry two men.

Antonin Scalia  Is -- is it your burden to show that it -- it -- it will harm marriage between a man and woman if -- if you allow two men or two women to marry? Is that your burden? I thought your burden was simply to show that -- that the State's reason for this institution is a reason that has nothing to do, that is inapplicable to same-sex couples.   Antonin Scalia  Well, that was then and this is now.   Antonin Scalia  Did Justice Breyer join that opinion that said that?   Antonin Scalia  My Lord.  Well, I --   Antonin Scalia  Even -- even if that marriage is -- is not lawful under -- under the receiving State's law; right?     That's right. There is definitely --   Antonin Scalia  Is that right? No matter -- I mean, suppose -- well, let's say someone gets married in a -- in a country that permits polygamy. Does a State have to acknowledge that marriage?     Well, of course, the State could assert justifications for not doing so, and I think there would be justifications --   Antonin Scalia  Okay.  So --     -- for not recognizing such --   Antonin Scalia  -- what would the justification be? That it's contrary to the State's public policy, I assume; right?     Well, no, Your Honor.  I think that the justification would be that the State doesn't have such an institution.  The -- a polygamous relationship would raise all kinds of questions that the State's marriage laws don't address.   Antonin Scalia  Well, it would be the same argument.  We don't have such an institution.  Our marriage in this State, which we constitutionally can have because the second question assumes that the first question comes out the way the United States does not want it to come out, the State says we only have the institution of heterosexual marriage.  We don't have the institution of same-sex marriage.     No.  The institution is the institution of marriage, and the experience of those States --   Antonin Scalia  Well, you're saying that, but the State doesn't.  The State says the only institution we have is heterosexual marriage.     The -- the point I'm making, Your Honor, I think is demonstrated by what has happened in those States where, by court order, States have had to permit same-sex couples to marry. All that has happened under their laws is that they have had to remove gender-specific language and substitute it with gender-neutral language.   Antonin Scalia  Well, I think -- I think what Kentucky is saying is that the long-term effects of having same-sex couples in Kentucky will be, which you -- you didn't agree with, but what -- what counsel for Respondent argued in the prior case, will be a -- a reduction in -- in -- in heterosexual marriages and a -- a reduction in the number of children born to those marriages.  I mean, that --     Your Honor, this Court has rejected that type of speculation as a basis for drawing these distinctions before as it did in Loving. The State in Loving argued that it was too soon to know what the effect of interracial marriages would be and what the stigma would be on their children if not the biological --   Antonin Scalia  But we will not have rejected it if we come out the way this question presented assumes we have come out.     Well, the State --   Antonin Scalia  Mainly, saying that it's okay for a State not to permit same-sex marriage.     The State asserts that it has an interest in the -- the stability that marriage provides for children.  That interest does not justify extinguishing marriages that already exist.   Antonin Scalia  You're rearguing Question 1 now? Is that -- is that what you're doing?     No.  No.  I'm suggesting, though --   Antonin Scalia  I thought you were.     -- that even a win on Question 2 does not fully validate our Petitioners' marriages, but certainly we think that the State cannot disregard them -- cannot effectively dissolve existing marriages without a sufficiently important reason for doing so. This Court recognized in the Lawrence case that marriage, procreation, family relationships, childrearing are fundamental aspects of autonomy that same-sex couples can enter into, can choose for purposes of autonomy to the same extent as opposite-sex couples, especially when those couples have done so, have established a marriage, have brought children into -- I'd like to give an example, if I could, because I think that it sort of brings home what's really happening. Matthew Mansell and Johno Espejo married in California in 2008.  In 2009, they adopted two children. Now, in reliance on the protection that is afforded by marriage, Mr. Espejo was willing to give up his job to give the primary caregiver of their children. Mr. Mansell is the primary breadwinner.  His job in an international law firm was transferred from California to Tennessee, and the cost of that transfer for that job for them was the destruction of their family relationships, all that they had relied on in building their lives together. And in support of that, the States offer exactly nothing.  There is no reason that the State needs to disregard that marriage.  No reason the State needs to destroy the reliance that Mr. Espejo has had in giving up his career to look after their children.  They are doing everything --   Antonin Scalia  It would have been -- it would have been the argument made with respect to the first question; namely, that the existence of same-sex marriages erodes, erodes the -- the feeling of society regarding heterosexual marriages.     As I said -- as I said before, Your Honor, I -- I don't think that that holds up because opposite-sex couples who have no children, who may be beyond childbearing years, when they move into these States, their marriages are entitled to respect, and yet they are situated precisely as our Petitioners are.  Our couples, likewise, have marriages.  They may not be able to procreate biologically together, but they are able to procreate through assisted means, through adoption.  They bring children into their families just as opposite-sex couples do.  And when, in reliance on their own State where they live, they move into these States, that marriage is destroyed. This Court relied on Federalism, the vertical kind, in Windsor to identify something that was highly unusual.  In this case, it's horizontal Federalism, I think, that identifies something that's highly unusual.  As part of a Federal form of government in which the States are equal, the States have ceded some form of their authority.  And one is to -- to recognize that when another State creates an enduring relationship, encourages people to, in reliance on the protections the law affords, to establish families, that it is not that other States are simply free to disregard that which those States have created. In the corporate context, once a corporation is established under the laws of one State, that corporation exists in all other States.  Certainly, the families that our Petitioners have established are entitled to at least that same respect. I think that, Your Honor, it is quite interesting to note that in the first argument, Michigan was forced to argue some positions that I think are quite astonishing, that the State could limit marriage to couples who are capable of procreation without assistance or indeed, that it could abolish marriage altogether. It's our clients who take marriage seriously.  They took vows to each other and bought into an institution that, indeed, as this Court has said, predates the Bill of Rights, that is the most important and fundamental in their lives, and the State should offer something more than mere pretext as ground to destroy it.   Antonin Scalia  What about Article IV? I'm so glad to be able to quote a portion of the Constitution that actually seems to be relevant.  ""Full faith and credit shall be given in each State to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State."" Now, why doesn't that apply?   Antonin Scalia  Public acts? It would include the act of marrying people, I assume.   Antonin Scalia  So there -- there's nothing in the Constitution that requires a State to acknowledge even those marriages in other States that -- that are the same.   Antonin Scalia  Really?   Antonin Scalia  We -- we can say the only marriages we acknowledge in -- in New York are marriages concluded in New York; is that possible?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  New York can say the only marriages we acknowledge in New York are those marriages that have been made under the laws of New York.   Antonin Scalia  Really?

You say it's punishment that's bad. You -- you want to abandon all of that? That's -- that's not the criteria?   Antonin Scalia  This is a due process case, right?   John F. Bash  It --   Antonin Scalia  It's not a Fourth Amendment case, and it's not an Eighth Amendment case; is that right?   John F. Bash  That's correct.  Now, Justice Scalia --   Antonin Scalia  It's just that you want to bring into the due process analysis --   John F. Bash  Justice Scalia, you characterize it as substantive due process, and --   Antonin Scalia  Yes.   John F. Bash  -- I think a couple cases have talked about it like that, but it's not exactly substantive process.  I mean, the rule this Court has established is that before you go through the procedures of the Bill of Rights conviction or a guilty plea and so forth, you may not be punished.  So it really sounds a little more in procedural due process than I think your question gave it credit for. Now, the other point is how you establish that purpose.  Under the Eighth Amendment standards this Court set forth, it has interpreted cruel and unusual punishment to require a degree of subjective intent. Although it has used the term ""punishment"" to describe the general legal standard under the Due Process Clause, of course, that clause does not say the word ""punishment.""

Antonin Scalia  I -- I -- I would think that the -- I would think just the opposite, that --that the necessity of finding the elements of the crime goes all the way back into the mists of history.

0,"Antonin Scalia  I find that a pretty fuzzy line, ""very direct effect."" It seems to me that there is a distinction between affecting retail rates, which, as Justice Kennedy has pointed out, always happens, and using -- using effect upon retail rates as a means of regulating wholesale rates.  And the argument here is that that is what has occurred, that effectively, FERC has raised the retail price during peak hours because somebody who wants to purchase at retail during peak hours not only pays -- you know, has to forgo the benefit that that person would otherwise get from FERC's program.  That raises the price at retail, and that is the means of achieving what FERC wants to achieve. Yes, FERC has the power to regulate wholesale rates.  But -- but, the argument is, not through the fiddling around with retail rates, which is what is asserted is happening here.   Antonin Scalia  Well, yes, ultimately, but the question is whether that is achieved by the means of directly managing retail rates.  And you say this does not.  What if FERC --   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  -- had sufficient funds available that it could pay people to not purchase electricity during peak hours? It just said, you know, we'll give you so much per day not to use more than X amount of electricity during peak hours.  Would that -- would that be within FERC's powers?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  It -- it's the difference between turning over money to these retail purchasers and simply depriving retail purchasers of a benefit that they could otherwise obtain in the wholesale market.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That -- that's interesting. If FERC has this power, how can it strip itself of this power by saying, we will not do this if the States don't want us to do it?   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's quite different. That's quite different from saying we're going to exercise it unless you, the States, veto it.  I don't know if FERC really has that power.  I don't know how it can confer a veto on the States.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Well, I think it's goes to whether FERC really thinks that it's meddling in -- in retail rates.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  That's what it goes to in my mind.  I think it's an acknowledgment by FERC that, in fact, you know, we are mucking around in an area that's the State's area.  And if the States don't want us to do it, we won't do it.   Antonin Scalia  One of the briefs, by the way, says that you had no authority to deregulate it. You know, we had a case involving the Federal Communications Commission which wanted to dispense the filing of tariffs on the part of everybody, I think, except AT&T.  And we held that the statute requires the agency to regulate rates and required filed rates. Isn't that a problem here too?   Antonin Scalia  Yes, I'm sure you are.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  I mean, I like deregulated markets.  But the problem is, do you have the authority to do it?   Antonin Scalia  That isn't the -- that isn't the central conduct here.  The central conduct is the refusal to buy power during peak hours.  That occurs in the retail market.  So why is that a direct effect? What -- what you're -- what you're telling people is, if you agree not to buy power at retail during certain hours, we're going to pay you.  I -- that seems to me an indirect effect, not a direct effect.   INTERRUPTING Antonin Scalia  Excuse me.  I think moving directly to control retail prices, subsidizing certain retail purchases, that also would directly affect the wholesale rate.  And -- and does that mean FERC is authorized to do that?
