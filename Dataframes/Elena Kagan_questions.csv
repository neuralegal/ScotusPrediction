0,"Elena Kagan  Well, do you actually have studies that show that video games are more harmful to minors than movies are?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Suppose a new study suggested that movies were just as violent.  Then, presumably, California could regulate movies just as it could regulate video games?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Morazzini, could I take you back to Justice Scalia's original question, which was what counts as deviant violence or morbid violence.  Because I read your briefs all the way through and the only thing that I found you said that was clearly covered by this statute was Postal 2.  But presumably the statute applies to more than one video game.  So what else does it apply to?  How many video games?  What kind of video games?  I mean, how would you describe in plain English what morbid violence is, what you have to see in a video game for it to be covered?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So anything that has those kinds of violence counts?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, so how do we separate violent games that are covered from violent games just as violent that are not covered?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So is what is covered here the mature category in the ratings?  Is that what this statute covers?  Is that what it's meant to cover?   Elena Kagan  Some but not all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So could I just make -- make sure I understand that, Mr. Morazzini, because as I understand the State has given up its argument that the interest protected by this law is an interest in preventing minors who see these games from going out and committing violent acts themselves; that the State is not saying that that's the interest in the law; is that correct?  That instead the State is saying that the interest in the law is in protecting children's moral development generally?   Elena Kagan  You think Mortal Combat is prohibited by this statute?   Elena Kagan  It's a candidate, meaning, yes, a reasonable jury could find that Mortal Combat, which is an iconic game, which I am sure half of the clerks who work for us spend considerable amounts of time in their adolescence playing.

Elena Kagan  Mr. Smith, do you think all video games are speech in the first instance?  Because you could look at these games and say they're the modern-day equivalent of Monopoly sets.  They are games.  They are things that people use to compete.  You know, when you think about some of them -- the first video game was Pong.  It was playing tennis on your TV.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Although that--   Elena Kagan  --Well, Mr. Bilderback, going back to your question of what's a claim.  So the claim here could be ineffective assistance at the penalty stage.  Or you could be saying, no, the claim is ineffective assistance for failing to present evidence of organic brain damage.  That would be a narrower understanding of the claim.  Or still narrower, it might be ineffective assistance for failing to present evidence of a particular kind of brain damage, frontal lobe brain damage, which is what the new doctor said, as opposed to what the old doctor said, which was bipolar disorder.  So how do we choose the level of generality, if you will, when we try to figure out what the claim is?   ",09-1088

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Hacker, you were saying that the question of whether there is support is reducible to the question of whether there are statistically significant findings.  Now, as I understand it, the FDA takes action all the time as to drugs -- they force the withdrawal of a drug from the market, they force relabeling of a drug -- on the basis of findings that are not statistically significant.  Now, clearly in those cases the market has a right to know the very things that are going to make the FDA take action against a product and that are going to severely affect the product's value to the company.  Not statistical significance there.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it could and eventually it did.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And you are suggesting a test for what -- what counts as material, which is statistically significant, a test that the FDA itself doesn't use when it thinks about what it should what it should regulate.   Elena Kagan  In most cases we don't know whether the claim is false or not.  So let me give you a hypothetical.  There's a pharmaceutical company and it comes out with its first and only product, it's 100 percent of the sales, and it's a new contact lens solution.  And it sells this product to many, many, many hundreds of thousands of people.  And most of them use this product with no adverse effect whatsoever, but there are ten cases where somebody uses this product and they go blind.  Three of those ten cases, the person had to borrow a contact lens from a friend, only used it in one eye, they go blind only in that one eye.  This is not statistically significant.  There is no way that anybody would tell that you these ten cases are statistically significant.  Would you stop using that product and would a reasonable investor want to know about those ten cases?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There are a lot of contact lens solutions in the world.  So if I heard that, ten people went blind, three used it in one eye, three went blind in that eye, I'd stop using the product; and if I were holding stock in that company, I would sell the stock.

Elena Kagan  Well, suppose the State says: We will not consider ourselves bound; we do have our own law with respect to Rule 23, but sometimes we'll go along with the Federal rule and sometimes we won't.  Is it then up to the courts to actually try to determine whether the -- the West Virginia court in this case would have gone along, would have interpreted its own rule of civil procedure the same way that the Federal Court interpreted the Federal rule?   Elena Kagan  When -- when Congress enacted CAFA, did Congress think about this precise issue, the issue that Justice Ginsburg is raising about a lawyer going from State to State with a different named plaintiff?  Was that -- was that part of what Congress was reacting to?   ",09-1205
0,"Elena Kagan  When you said on that issue, Mr. Beck, on what issue, because I think that there is an argument in this case that the West Virginia approach to class certification is different from the Eighth Circuit's approach, that Rezulin would not have been the way that the Eighth Circuit would have approached the class certification question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Beck, I'm -- I'm not sure that White answers the question that I asked, because White decided a matter of substantive liability, and the question I asked was whether the approach to class certification was different in the Eighth Circuit and in West Virginia.   Elena Kagan  If you look at Rezulin, if you compare to it some Eighth Circuit cases, there seems to be a difference in at least tone, shall we say, about the extent to which a finding is required that common issues predominate.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Beck, the relitigation exception of the Anti-Injunction Act speaks in terms of judgments.  Why is the denial of class certification a judgment?   Elena Kagan  But the judgment, if I understood it correctly, there was just a contemporaneous summary judgment motion, and the court granted summary judgment as well.  But the denial of class certification isn't responsible for the judge's dismissal of the suit.   Elena Kagan  So that sounds like a very contingent answer to my question.  If that were not the case, if it -- if there was the denial of a class certification, but then the action proceeds as a non-class litigation, you think that there would be no judgment, and so the Anti-Injunction Act would not apply?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Oh, but why isn't it really, because here what happened was that there was a denial of class certification and there was a granting of a summary judgment motion at one and the same time?  But the thing that was responsible for getting the case out of court was the granting of the summary judgment motion, not the denial of class certification.  That was extraneous to the judgment that the case was dismissed.   ",09-1205

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Phillips, my trouble listening to you is that it seems as though you are asking us to re-find facts.  You know, you have these judges who have been involved in these cases since the beginning, for 20 years in the Plata case, who thought, we've done everything we can.  The receiver has done everything he can.  This just isn't going anywhere and it won't go anywhere until we can address this root cause of the problem and that was the view of the judges who had been closest to the cases from the beginning and the view of the three-judge court generally.  So how can we reach a result essentially without, you know, re-finding the facts that they have been dealing with for 20 years?

1,"Elena Kagan  But I don't understand why the smell of marijuana is necessary.  This goes back to what Justice Sotomayor was saying, you don't need probable cause to knock on a door.  Knocking on a door is perfectly lawful.  So, if there's just a lawfulness test, the knock is fine.  And then when you hear whatever it is that you hear that you think creates exigent circumstances, whether it's a toilet flushing or whether it's just noise, that too gives you the ability to go right in.  So -- so if it's just lawfulness, you don't need the marijuana smell even, do you?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Probable cause beyond thinking that the evidence--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --is being destroyed?   Elena Kagan  Okay.   Elena Kagan  Ms. O'Connell, if I could ask you about the government's proposed standard: You say that as long as each step in the police conduct is lawful, that's sufficient, and each step would -- the way the Fourth Amendment works, each step, we're asking, essentially, whether each step is reasonable.  What some courts have done in addition to that -- and this was not the approach of the court below -- but what some courts have done is to say, we also ask a more holistic reasonableness question.  We say: Is the whole process by which the police operated with respect to this person reasonable?  So, for example, we might say, you know: Was there time to get a warrant or did it look like the police were just -- they preferred not to have to deal with a magistrate?  So what's wrong with that sort of standard?  In addition to asking whether each step is reasonable, to say: Look, is the whole pattern here of what the police did to come up with this evidence reasonable?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Farley, one of the points of the Fourth Amendment is to ensure that when people search your home, they have a warrant, and of course there are exceptions to that.  But if there is one place where the warrant requirement has real force, it's in the home.  And I think that the concern here, and you have some strong arguments on your side, but the concern here is that your test is going to enable the police to penetrate the home, to search the home, without a warrant, without going to see a magistrate, in a very wide variety of cases, that all the police really have to say is: We saw pot, we heard noise.  Or: We think there was some criminal activity going on for whatever reason and we heard noise.  How do you prevent that from happening?  How do you prevent your test from essentially eviscerating the warrant requirement in the context of the one place that the Fourth Amendment was most concerned about?   INTERRUPTING ",09-1272

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Phillips, could I ask you whether that principle makes any sense in this contracting situation, because both parties have argued it as though the question of who is the moving party is determinative of this case, but in a contract situation the question of who's the moving party is very often arbitrary or fortuitous.  If you think about it in a private setting, you have one contract, one contractor who fails to perform or -- or provides some deficient product, another who decides it's not going to pay, and the question of who the plaintiff is, is often just a matter of fortuity, who gets to the courthouse first--   Elena Kagan  --what the payment schedule has been like, so whether somebody is demanding their money back or simply refusing to pay it at all.  So, why in this contract situation is the question of who's the plaintiff or who's the moving party, why does -- why does that make such a difference?   Elena Kagan  But it can't possibly be the case that the question is what the payment schedule is.  If I've paid you already and then I find your product deficient, then I'm going to go to court and demand my money back.  If I find your product deficient before I pay you, then you are going to go to court and say, you have to pay me.  So why should that difference make a difference with respect to the constitutional question before us?   Elena Kagan  Both parties have a claim here.  One says you provided deficient performance; the other says you were obligated to pay me.  The question of who has the claim and who has the affirmative defense, it can be structured in either way.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Fergenson, in your question presented to this Court, you asked whether there's personal jurisdiction -- and I'm quoting here --  ""solely because the manufacturer targets the United States market for the sale of its product. ""  So I'm taking from that, that you acknowledge that this manufacturer, McIntyre, a British manufacturer, targeted the United States market for the sale of its product.  That's correct, yes?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's your question presented--   Elena Kagan  --Did this -- well, I'll just ask you, then: Did this manufacturer target the United States market?  Did it want to sell its products in the United States?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So what does that mean, exactly, Mr. Fergenson?  Because the United States is the United States.  It's made up of 50 States.  So I assume that what that means is the manufacturer wanted to sell its products in each of the 50 States.  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  It only wanted to sell its product in a few States?   Elena Kagan  Right, anywhere.  So if the distributor came up with California, that was great.  If the distributor came up with a customer in New Jersey, that was great.  As many as possible, more the better, all over the United States.  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  Exactly.  So you targeted New Jersey no less than you targeted California or New York or Illinois or Massachusetts or anything else.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You targeted the entire United States?  Why shouldn't there be jurisdiction in each of the States you targeted?   Elena Kagan  Well, suable in any State where the incident arises.  This is not general jurisdiction.  This is specific jurisdiction.  So the question is, when you target the entire United States and each of the 50 States within that and an accident occurs within one of those States, are you subject to jurisdiction in that State for that accident, for a claim based on that accident?  Not generally, but just for a claim based on that accident.  Didn't even Justice O'Connor -- you referenced the Asahi opinions, but Justice O'Connor said as long as there's purposeful availment, there is specific jurisdiction, and there is purposeful availment when there's an active effort to target a market.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fergenson, just picking up where Justice Ginsburg left off, Ohio is a perfectly good place for jurisdiction over a claim between the British manufacturer and its distributor in Ohio.  Any kind of contract claim, a claim based on the agreement between the two, Ohio is the appropriate place for jurisdiction.  But Ohio does not seem the appropriate place for jurisdiction -- and again, we're talking about specific jurisdiction, not general -- as to a claim based on an accident that occurred in New Jersey.  The entire idea of specific jurisdiction is that you need a relationship between the defendant and the forum and the claim, and here the claim arose in New Jersey and was in fact not related to Ohio.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fergenson, could I try another hypothetical?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Fergenson, the question is whether seeking to serve a market -- and here you're seeking to serve a market in each of the 50 States -- is purposeful availment.  So let me just try a different hypothetical.  Suppose you had the same arrangement with your distributor in Ohio, but the arrangement was not to serve the entire United States market.  Instead, the arrangement was to serve only five States in the Midwest.  That's what you wanted, your client wanted, the market to be.  So it was going to be Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Michigan and Iowa, all right?  So now a machine blows up in Illinois.  Is there jurisdiction in Illinois?   Elena Kagan  There is jurisdiction in Illinois, even though your relationship with your distributor was in Ohio.  But there's jurisdiction in Illinois because the machine blew up there and you were seeking to serve the market; that's right?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Now we have -- now we say this is working very well.  Let's get another nine distributors on board.  We'll give each of them five states, all right?  Now, if I understand you correctly, now you're liable all over the United States because you've had this relationship with ten different distributors, each of whom are going to serve five states.  So there's personal jurisdiction in any state where a machine blows up.   Elena Kagan  And now I say: Let's forget these ten distributors.  Who needs ten distributors?  I'll just have one distributor.  Why is there any difference?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fergenson, with respect, this distributor was told to sell as many products as it could in as many States as it could.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Fergenson, could I ask you a question?   ",09-1343
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Ross, do you think if there's a small business in the United States that sells a product and that actively seeks to serve a foreign market, maybe it's Great Britain, maybe it's China, and that product blows up in that foreign country -- Great Britain, China -- do you think that the manufacturer, the American manufacturer is subject to jurisdiction there?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  All -- all over the world this is true; is that right?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Ross, we do that now; isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  And Mr. Ross, isn't the point that he was selling by using large convention sites in the United States, expecting that people from other -- would show up to those large convention sites?  I know that Justice Alito doesn't want to hear this, but New Jersey doesn't have all that many large convention sites like Las Vegas does.  Newark is not such a hot place, but they're expecting people from Newark to go and look at these machines and buy these machines.  That's the marketing system that's used for these massive machines that they're trying to sell nationwide.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And Mr. Fergenson, isn't that what Justice O'Connor said in Asahi, that the component manufacturer may have all the knowledge in the world -- for Justice Brennan, that was enough; for Justice O'Connor, it was not enough that knowledge was insufficient, that there had to be purposeful availment, that there had to be an active decision, a choice to seek the market.

Elena Kagan  Well, now I'm a little confused, because the efficient market and materiality are all part of the prima facie case triggering the Basic presumption.  So, why couldn't you rebut one part of that case but not another part of that case?

Elena Kagan  Mr. Sterling, I wasn't sure what argument you were making in your brief.  One possible argument you could be making is that the plaintiffs have to show a price impact.  Another possible argument you could be making is that you have to have the opportunity to rebut the plaintiff's use of the Basic presumption by yourself showing that there was no price impact.  And you seemed often to be saying the first, even though I would think that the second is the most you can make as a -- as a plausible argument.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Sterling, maybe this is just to repeat Justice Ginsburg's question, but what else is there?  I mean, what would not be proper to introduce in the way that you're talking about at the certification stage?   Elena Kagan  The Fifth Circuit suggested that scienter could come in at the -- at the certification stage.  You're disclaiming that?   Elena Kagan  On your rebuttal proof point, you said just now that all you had to do was come forward with some evidence, but that the burden remains on the plaintiff.  Is that -- what kind of evidence do you think you have to come forward with in order to flip the burden back to the plaintiff?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you're saying you can put an expert on the stand and the expert will say there was no price impact, and then the plaintiffs have to make the case that there, in fact, was a -- a price impact at the certification stage, that the plaintiffs have to prove that by a preponderance?   Elena Kagan  Once you put a expert on the -- on the stand.   Elena Kagan  Well, that does suggest that the Basic presumption isn't worth much in your world.  That you put an expert on the stand, and the Basic presumption falls away, and the plaintiffs have to actually prove their case at that very early stage that there was no price impact.   ",09-1403
1,"Elena Kagan  General Kroger, I don't think that the question here is really a standing question; it's really whether there is a controversy between this particular plaintiff and this particular defendant such that a judgment in this case would actually affect the legal relationship between the two, between the particular plaintiff and the particular defendant.  So how would it do that?  How would a legal judgment in this case affect the legal relationship between this plaintiff and this defendant?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Kruger, how does this -- this situation, the qualified immunity situation, differ from a wide variety of other situations in which we might not be able to get to the underlying constitutional ruling?  For example, in any case where there's a constitutional ruling but also a harmless error ruling, or in a Sixth Amendment case where there are standards about ineffective assistance of counsel but then a finding that there's no prejudice.  In all of those kinds of cases, the underlying substantive ruling might be insulated from our review.

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Schnapper, can I ask Justice Kennedy's question in maybe a little bit of a different way?  In -- in the Connick inquiry, you have a threshold inquiry and then you have a balancing test.  Now, you're suggesting that the threshold inquiry, the public concern inquiry, is kind of apples and oranges here; it's just not appropriate for the Petition Clause.  But the question that then follows is, should there be a replacement threshold inquiry before you get to the balancing that Connick suggests is the second stage of the process?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Schnapper, isn't the real question in these cases whether the employee is acting as a citizen or instead whether the employee is acting as an employee?  And in the speech cases, that distinction suggests a public concern threshold inquiry.  Maybe in the petition cases it suggests something else, but that that's really the question we should be asking is, is this employee acting as an employee or as a citizen?   INTERRUPTING ",09-1476
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Pincus, if -- if I understand your interpretation correctly, it would exclude freebase.  How is that a sensible interpretation of the statute, one that would exclude freebase, a commonly known substance?  Congress was aware of it.  The Richard Pryor incident had occurred.  Everybody knew it was dangerous.  Wasn't it at least true that Congress meant to incorporate that substance as well?   Elena Kagan  That means prepared from the powder, in theory--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --is that right?   Elena Kagan  Would it be enough for you if it had the right chemical definition and it was a rock-like substance, just those two things?  Would that be enough?  If the government could show it has the right chemical definition, it's rock-like, it's solid, does it have to show anything else?

",09-1533
1,"Elena Kagan  It's a bizarre term, Ms. Saharsky.  It's -- I mean, cocaine base means the same exact same thing as cocaine, because cocaine is a base.  It's like referring to an apple by saying ""apple fruit"" or referring to a poodle by saying ""poodle dog"".  I mean, it's a strange way to speak about it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's a strange way to be extra clear, to -- to use a different phrase that's meant to mean the same thing as another phrase.  To use two different phrases that are meant to mean the same thing is not a very good way of being clear.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But they don't need to do that, Ms. Saharsky.  Suppose we just said it needs the right chemical definition, and it's rock-like, rock-like, crystalline, whatever you want to call it.  So it's rock-like.  It's not a paste; it's not a leaf; it's a rock.   Elena Kagan  But this is -- but this is, Ms. Saharsky, just a strange statute, where you are -- your definition creates all kinds of issues about why it is that Congress used two different phrases to mean the same thing, and then how it is that if they did use two different phrases to mean the same thing, you're effectively reading cocaine out of the statute in Romanette (ii), right?   Elena Kagan  Well, but no, cocaine is the same as cocaine base.  So it's like saying -- it's like saying apples, oranges, and bananas cost one dollar; aforesaid apples cost three dollars.  That's a strange way to write a statute.   Elena Kagan  But why would it say apples cost one dollar in Romanette (ii) if it was going to say apples cost three dollars in Romanette (iii)?

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Frederick, a substantial part of the power of your argument comes from this notion that, as Justice Ginsburg said, that JCM was in the driver's seat, that JCM had control, that they were -- Janus was at most an alter ego of JCM and maybe something more, that it was just a creature of JCM.  But the securities legislation seems to deal with that in section 20.

So, why should we think relevant the kind of controlled relationship that you're talking about?

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Duncan, could I give you a hypothetical--   Elena Kagan  --just to test how strong your position is here.  So let's say that there is a new D.A. comes to town and he says, there's going to be one attorney per case from now on and it will be a random assignment system.  So sometimes important cases will be tried by experienced attorneys, but sometimes they'll be tried by people right out of law school.  And there will be no Brady supervision at all, no Brady training.  And there is a closed file system, that we only turn over what we are required to turn over and not anything else.  And in addition to that, if I, the D.A., find that you have turned over things that you are not required to turn over, that will be taken into account in your yearly review for promotion purposes, for salary purposes, et cetera.  That will be very severely frowned upon.  So the new D.A.--   Elena Kagan  --If you turn over anything that you didn't have to.  Okay?   Elena Kagan  If you give any material that you are not required to do by law.  And so he puts into place this whole system and says, okay, go to it.  And what happens is that there are Brady violations.  And there is a Brady violation in a capital case and the person sits on death row, or the person is executed, whichever, and there is a claim brought.  Is that claim not a good claim?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There is not a pattern, because he just came to town and he just, you know, instituted all these policies, and this is the first Brady violation.   Elena Kagan  But the failure to train or supervise in any way and setting up a structural system that's pretty much guaranteed to produce Brady violations, that would not be enough?  In other words, even if the jury said yes, you are liable under that second theory -- not the policy theory, but the failure to train and supervise theory -- that would have to be rejected?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could I add to my hypothetical, then?   Elena Kagan  Suppose that this new district attorney said -- every day he came into the office and he said: I think Brady is just crazy, and I think it's just the worst decision that the Supreme Court has ever issued; and as long as you don't get caught, anything you do is okay by me.   Elena Kagan  It's not a policy.  He's just, you know, making his views known around the office.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Then the policy is just that you have to turn over what you have to turn over, nothing else, and if you turn over anything else you will get penalized for doing so?  That's the policy?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Duncan, that I think you can't say, because that's just overturning what the jury found.     Elena Kagan  The jury found that there was inadequate training.

You suggested to the Chief Justice formal training wasn't -- isn't necessary if there is some supervision, if there is some mentoring.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Mills, if I could just understand your answer to Justice Alito.  You concede that the Sixth Circuit opinion is using the record built on the whole trial and that that's a different record from the record that existed at summary judgment; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So they have that first paragraph where they suggest that they're ruling on a summary judgment motion.  Then they go through an entire opinion that talks about the facts and the record.  And there are very few citations, but your understanding is that when they talk about the facts in the record they are talking about the post-trial, I mean the record that has been built up as a result of the trial?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Mills, when -- when Unitherm talks about the district court feeling the case and having a feel for the case, it's talking about having ae feel for the evidence and for the facts.  The whole rationale of Unitherm is based on the evidence, the facts, not on purely legal questions.  So suppose we disagree with you about the reach of Unitherm.  Suppose we say Unitherm doesn't have any application to purely legal questions.  What would that mean for your case?  Which part of your claims were purely legal and which part were instead founded on the facts, in which case you would have a better Unitherm argument?   Elena Kagan  And Mr. Mills, if that were the basic hornbook rule, your claims are all matters of fact or mixed questions of fact and law?   Elena Kagan  There are no purely legal issues?

Why is that any different from asking whether a particular kind of conduct amounted to negligence, which in a previous case this Court said you had did have to make 50(b), a 50(b) motion in order to preserve.  That was in the Johnson v. New York case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Mizer, suppose that they were.  Suppose they committed an error in that respect, and they thought they were reviewing the summary judgment order and not the final judgment.  If that's what they thought, would you agree that they had no jurisdiction at that point to take that appeal because the 30 days had run?

""  How does that sentence -- how is that sentence less implicated, in a case about a private figure than in a case about a public figure?   Elena Kagan  But that goes back to the question that was asked previously about, suppose you had a general statute that just said, there will be no disruptions of any kind at private funerals.  You know, pick your distance, 500 feet, 1,000 feet, but something that didn't refer to content, that didn't refer to ideas, that just made it absolutely clear that people could not disrupt private funerals.  What harm would that statute not address in your case?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Summers, could I ask you to go back to an answer that you gave to one of my colleagues when you were last up there?  You said that a -- a more standard antiwar demonstration, ""get out of Iraq"", ""war is immoral"", at this funeral, same distance, same sized signs -- that a more standard antiwar demonstration would be protected by the First Amendment from an intentional infliction of emotional distress suit.  And I'm wondering why that is.  If you think that what is -- what causes the lack of protection here is the kind of glomming to a private funeral, the exploitation of a private person's grief, the -- the appearance for no other reason than to gain publicity at a private event -- if that's the problem, why doesn't it also apply to a standard, you know, ""get out of Iraq"", ""war is wrong"", kind of demonstration?   Elena Kagan  Well, suppose it is not disrupted and suppose -- and I know you that this is, that contest these facts -- that yours wasn't disrupted, that they stopped when you started, that they were a sufficient number of feet away from the funeral and so forth.  So we are just talking the fact that there are people who have -- who are appropriating and taking advantage of a private funeral in order to express their views, and they are in compliance with all of the content-neutral rules.

Elena Kagan  So does that mean that now we have to start reading each sign, and saying ""war is wrong"" falls on one side of the line but ""you are a war criminal"" falls on another side of the line?

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Olson, we have several times referred to the plan as having a range of documents associated with it, not as having just a single written instrument, but we referred to documents and instruments governing the plan.  We did that in Curtiss-Wright, which is the case that you pin so much on.  We did that in Kennedy.  And the statute itself talks about that on numerous occasions, that there are documents and instruments, in the plural, and one would think that the SPD is -- is one of those documents and instruments that govern the plan.   Elena Kagan  Well, I was struck by something else, Mr. Olson.  I was struck by the fact that the -- that the statute saying what is in the summary plan description is packed with information that needs to be in the summary plan description.  By contrast, the written instrument, which you equate to the plan, the written instrument says barely anything about what has to be in it.  It just says the name of the fiduciaries has to be in the written instrument.  So it seems clear that this statute is set up so that everything that is important, everything that the employee needs to know and needs to rely upon, is supposed to be in the SPD, not necessarily in the written instrument.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But can't the SPD--   Elena Kagan  --But, Mr. Olson, what about the opposite?  Because the statute seems to be written so that things are in the SPD which don't need to be in the written instrument.  And together, they all somehow constitute the plan.   Elena Kagan  But the SPD can't negate the force of ERISA, and if ERISA says that the summary has to be consistent with the plan documents nothing in the SPD can negate that requirement.   Elena Kagan  But the very question here is if there is an SPD that is inconsistent in some way with the written instrument, what happens?  Is the written instrument modified or instead is the provision in the SPD given operative effect?  And that question is one about your benefits under the plan.   Elena Kagan  I do think you are over-reading Curtiss-Wright.  Curtiss -- Wright talked about whether a particular provision satisfied the requirement that a plan have an amendment provision.  It didn't say anything at all about whether there are provisions that can have operative effect regardless of whether they pass through a formal amendment procedure.   ",09-804X

It's just that Rule 35 motions that seek discretionary relief do not.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Weisman, I think that that's not right, that the -- as you say, that the Rule 35 motion that Rhode Island has is based on the Federal Rule 35 motion that existed prior to 1987, and that on a couple of occasions this Court talked about that prior Federal Rule 35 as collateral review.  Am I wrong about that?   Elena Kagan  U.S. v. Robinson, Barton v. United States.  I might be wrong about it.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Weisman, I'm sorry.  Before you talk about policy, so this motion to reduce sentence is very short.  It just says that the man  ""prays that the sentence imposed with respect to the above matter be reduced in accordance with the provisions of Rule 35. ""  Would it make a difference to you if it said he prays that the sentence imposed -- he  ""prays that the illegal sentence imposed with respect to the above matter be reduced in accordance with provisions of Rule 35? ""   Elena Kagan  If he had put in that word ""illegal"", would that have made the difference?

And this is going to be a very difficult determination.   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Weisman, that's true also of State habeas claims that are based only on State law.

Elena Kagan  Well, this--   Elena Kagan  --But Mr. Pincus--   Elena Kagan  --But, Mr. Pincus, I'm not understanding what test you are asking us to formulate.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Burke, if we could stay with this.  The $471 is derived by looking at the average loan or lease payments nationwide.  Then in addition to that we know that the IRS has a separate category for operating costs that is meant to reflect costs of having a car that are not your loan and lease payments.  So between those two things, why wouldn't we say that ownership costs means your loan and lease payments, but operating costs means your other costs of having a car, and that you get the operating costs if you have a car but don't make loan and lease payments and you get the ownership costs if you do make loan and lease payments?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  For example, Mr. Burke, what would happen if you didn't actually have any out-of-pocket medical costs?  Could you still claim a deduction for out-of-pocket medical costs?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Burke, even you would say -- is this correct -- that if you don't own a car at all you can't claim the car costs?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Burke, if the table said loan and lease costs, you wouldn't have a case?  If it said, instead of ownership costs, if it said loan and lease costs, then you would sit down and you would say I'm not entitled to that deduction?   Elena Kagan  Even if it's called loan and lease costs?   Elena Kagan  Ms. Saharsky, could you explain to me the Government's position on when a debtor with loan and lease payments gets to deduct them under Romanette II?  In other words, this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, the notwithstanding clause and whether the notwithstanding clause effectively excludes all loan and lease payments from Romanette II?   Nicole A. Saharsky  It does not have that affect, Your Honor.  What it does is to take out the actual debt payments that are part of the other necessary expenses, these are on page 25-A of the red brief that counsel on our side mentioned.  These are other necessary expenses that are actual debt payments and the local and national standards are expense amounts.  We don't think that Congress defined those to be debt payments.  So the function of the payments for debts language, we agree with Respondent's counsel would be twofold.  First, it would excise the other necessary expenses that actually are debt payments, which makes complete sense.  One of them is an unsecured debt payment, and you wouldn't want to consider that one of your expenses because the whole point of the calculation is to figure out how much money you have left to pay unsecured debt.  And then the other function that it serves is in Romanette III because you were getting secured debt payments there to not double-count them in Romanette II.   Elena Kagan  But, in other words, the loan and lease payments don't count as debt for purposes of the notwithstanding clause, they count as expense amounts?   Nicole A. Saharsky  We say that those are expense amounts that are specified, they're not payments for debts.  I should note, because Justice Kennedy asked this question, that this was not something that was relied upon by the courts below.  I don't believe there is any definitive court of appeals opinion that goes through in detail what that provision is designed to do.  So I would urge this Court that it need not resolve it in this case and instead do what the court of appeals did, which is to say that just looking at the plain text, the word applicable means not everybody can get these amounts in the national and local standards and it needs to be someone who actually has those payment amounts.  The whole point of this part of this statute is to figure out what money is available to pay unsecured creditors and it's payments that need to be made for expenses that matter, it's not whether the individual debtor has a car.  I also note just because it came up earlier and is a very important point, that to the extent that the Court only wants to look at the tables to figure out what are ownership costs, are they loan and lease payments.  Just looking at the title of the table, ownership costs, you need to have costs.  Looking at the fact that there are two different ones, there is ownership costs as opposed to operating costs, makes clear that some of the things that Petitioner suggests might be ownership costs are, in fact, operating costs.

In your brief, you admit that there are numerous cases that don't fit within that category, where the -- but where the State has acted in some sense to change the behavior of the person, to regulate the person, even if that person doesn't have a proceeding in which to mount a defense.  And this Court has treated those cases in exactly the same way, haven't they?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Mr. Kneedler--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Kneedler, this is what you said in your cert stance brief: You said  ""those programs in which the drastic measure of withholding all or a major portion of the Federal funding is the only available remedy. ""  and you are talking here about Spending Clause programs, obviously --  ""would be generally less effective than a system that also permits awards of injunctive relief in private actions. ""   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can that really be the difference?  I mean, do you think if 30(A) were written -- were drafted as a formula, a rate schedule formula, that there would be a cause of action, but because 30(A) is more general in nature, that there is no cause of action?  I mean, surely that's a question for the merits of whether there is preemption or not.   ",09-958X

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Phillips--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Phillips, can I ask you a little bit more about how this interacts with the agency process?  Now suppose that California had done what, the way I read the statute, it was supposed to do, which is to go to the agency and say we want to change our rates?  We can't afford these rates any more and we think these lower rates would do just as well.  All right.  And then the agency and California sit down and discuss the matter.  Would this suit have ever come into being?   Elena Kagan  You know, they did not impose them unilaterally.  They go to the -- to HHS and they wait for HHS to approve what they want to do.  If HHS approves--   Elena Kagan  --Well, if HHS approved, maybe somebody does sue.  And then there is great deference to the agency, isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  And if HHS doesn't approve, then what's there to talk about?  There is no suit.   Elena Kagan  So either way, the agency wins; right?

That the Court was out of authority to decide any of those cases, but somehow nobody on the Court recognized that fact, nor did the SG recognize that fact?  The SG participated, I believe, in each of those cases.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Bickett, could you explain something to me just -- I have been puzzling and puzzling over this scheme.  Can you tell me why Arizona adopted this sort of scheme rather than the more typical tuition voucher scheme?  In other words tuition voucher schemes the state just gives the voucher or scholarship or what have you.  This is so much more complicated and complex and unusual.  And it just left me wondering why it was chosen or what the State thinks the advantages of it are now?   Elena Kagan  Could I try Justice Kennedy's question in a slightly different way.  I'm assuming that you would agree that if this was just a straight tuition voucher program, the State could not give tuition vouchers on the basis of religion, could not say, if you are a Catholic you don't get these tuition vouchers.  But what the State has done here, apparently, is to set up a scheme that uses intermediaries that can make exactly that distinction, that can say, sorry, if you are a Catholic you don't get scholarships out of our STO.  And the question is why should the State be able to do that?  If the State can't do it itself in providing tuition vouchers, why should the State be able to set up a system using intermediaries that exist for no other reason than to administer this program that can make those distinctions?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the plaintiffs contend, the plaintiffs contend and this is a motion to dismiss, so we have to accept their contentions as settled, that there are STOs that make these distinctions that clearly would be impermissible if the State administered the program.  These are not preexisting charitable organizations.  They are not preexisting schools.  They are entities that are set up solely for the purpose of administering this program, and yet the State is saying it can make distinctions that the State itself cannot.   INTERRUPTING ",09-987X

Are the beneficiaries of this program the parents, or are the beneficiaries of this program the general taxpayers?

I know that you contest your obligation to make that request, but do you think you could go to the FDA and make that request and set a process in motion?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, if you could go to the FDA, why shouldn't we look at this suit in this way: That the plaintiffs are bringing a standard failure to warn claim; that you then have a preemption defense, that you'll say it's impossible; and then in order to litigate that preemption defense, the question will be, well, if you had gone to the FDA, what would the FDA have done?  Would it in fact have required both brand names and generics to change the label?  And if it would have, you would not have had -- been put in an impossible position.   Elena Kagan  But Mr. Lefkowitz, I think what the Respondents would say is that you are mischaracterizing their complaint and making it into something that it's not.  Their complaint is a standard state failure to warn claim.  Now, you have a preemption defense to that claim, and in that preemption defense there's going to be questions about your disclosure obligations and whether the FDA would have responded in a certain way to your disclosure obligations, but it's in a fundamentally different posture than the one that you're suggesting.   Elena Kagan  Well, I agree that you don't have any ability yourself to change the warning, but here's what the FDA has said.  The FDA has said if an ANDA applicant -- and that's you; you're an ANDA applicant -- believes new safety information should be added to a product's labeling, presumably because they've gotten information that suggests that the product's labeling is wrong, then it should contact the FDA, and the FDA will determine whether the labeling for the generic and listed drugs should be revised.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Lefkowitz, if you had asked, you would be in a different situation.  If you had asked and the FDA had sat on it or was negotiating, then you could say, look, we've done all we can right now.  But you're not in that situation.  You, in fact, have not done all you can right now to change the label because you never wrote that letter.   INTERRUPTING ",09-993X

So is a year unreasonable?  Is 5 months the outer bounds, you know, assuming you don't have a good reason?  I understand that if you have a good reason, that can lengthen it.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Cattani, can I ask about your interests here, because your State is one that does appoint counsel.  So you already have the costs there.  I'm just wondering, in your brief, you talk a lot about the excessive costs that this would impose on you.  And I'm just wondering where those costs come from if you appoint counsel already.  And I know some other States are in a different situation, but as to you, where do the costs come from?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, if we just said there is, you know, we can only draw a line in this context and we're going to draw the line here, and this is where it sticks.  What are the additional costs to you?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Cattani, if you handled this through the regular appeals process, the person would receive the benefit of counsel.  Is that correct?  Rather than shuttle this over to the post-conviction review process?   Elena Kagan  Yes, exactly right.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Try--   Elena Kagan  --Well, Massaro indeed said there are good reasons for withdrawing this issue and putting it in a different kind of process.  So suppose the State does this, and some States do it: they say on -- in the direct appeal process, we are going to remand this issue back to the trial court because the trial court is going to be fast and can make an evaluation.  That's part of the direct appeal process, this -- this remand.  Would the person then be entitled to effective assistance of counsel?   Elena Kagan  Even though now it's part of the regular appeals process.  It's just the way -- because of the issues that we recognized in Massaro, the State has decided to structure things in this way?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So now you are creating a different rule.  You are saying anything which somebody determines is appropriately raised as a collateral attack, even if there's been no first review of that question, there is no entitlement to counsel?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I don't think as Justice Kennedy says that we ever really considered that question in Finley and Giarratano, because we were assuming there that all the things had been through the appeals process.   Elena Kagan  Well, the reason I think it's relevant is that if you were to say that there needed to be effective assistance of counsel there, then I would have asked you, what is the difference between this case and that case?  So that's the reason it is relevant to this case, because the difference is really just one of just labels.   Elena Kagan  But they didn't -- only the first--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --Look at the effective assistance claims.

Would that be all right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sure the State would not say it was acting arbitrarily in my example.  The State would say there is a good reason for it, the Fourth Amendment exclusion claims are disfavored, they have nothing to do with innocence; they involve a kind of fact-intensive inquiry that is better done in a different proceeding.  So I think that the State would have many good reasons, but, you know, it's also true that there, you don't get a lawyer.   INTERRUPTING ",10-1001
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Foreman, I -- I guess the question in this case is what this particular statutory provision has to do with gender discrimination and the history of gender discrimination: Whether Congress was aiming to eradicate gender discrimination through this provision, or whether it was trying to do something else entirely.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But women don't get sick less often than men, do they?   Elena Kagan  So you're just adding something to both sides of the balance and it doesn't affect the employer's incentive.  The employer still -- the hypothetical discriminatory employer would still say, well, women are going to be caregivers more often, so I'm -- I'm going to not hire that person.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that's why (A), (B), and (C) go to the problem, but what does (D) have to do with it?  If you assume that both men and women get sick at an approximately equal rate -- maybe you don't assume that -- but if you do, it doesn't seem to factor into the employer's incentives in any way.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you are saying -- let me just make sure I understand.  You are saying that the -- that Congress is thinking that an employer actually does think that women take more sick leave because women get pregnant.  And just as Congress was thinking about the employer who thought women are going to take more family leave, you think Congress was thinking about the employer who thinks women are also going to take more sick leave because of pregnancy?   Elena Kagan  Do you have any evidence that Congress in fact was thinking about either of these two things?  Is there anything in the record that suggests either of those two theories?   Elena Kagan  I would go with Justice Alito here.   ",10-1016
0,"Elena Kagan  If I could just stop you there, Mr. Howard, for a second.  I took from Mr. Foreman something that I hadn't understood from his briefs -- maybe because I just missed it -- which is that he's making a kind of analogous argument, that, just as in the prior provisions of the act, employers thought of women as caregivers and the response of Congress was to provide a gender-neutral leave benefit that had both -- that both women and men were eligible for.  So here, employers think of women as needing more medical leave because of pregnancy, and the response of Congress is to provide gender-neutral sick leave.  So what is your response to that argument?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And -- and Mr. Howard, I -- I do think that the point about the package is that if you look at (D) alone, you abstract it from everything else, you have a good point, that it seems to be related to economic security, which is not a section 5 issue; that it seems to be related to discrimination against sick people, which would also put us in a different legal universe.  But when you look at (D) as passed at the same moment on the basis of the same record as (A), (B), and (C), with the overwhelming purpose of Congress being to protect women from discrimination in the workplace because of unfair stereotypical gender -- views about what women do as workers, then (D) assumes a different kind of aura.  And you can talk about a-number of theories for that, but I guess I would just ask for your reaction to that, that (D) is just part of a package which was about telling employers, get rid of your old stereotypes, don't act on your old stereotypes, employ women.

Would a person have anything more than that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But in Wyatt, we said that that was a very different kind of immunity than the Harlow immunity, and we said historically it provided no basis for giving Harlow immunity.

Seems to me that there's -- there was only a malice defense.  But isn't that always true when it comes to a -- a private person?  In other words, of course there is no historic basis for qualified immunity.  This kind of immunity was developed in 1970.  It's sort of by definition, there is no historic basis for this sort of immunity.  So to say that the historic basis matters is really to say that private people never get Harlow immunity.

0,"Elena Kagan  It looks to me as though you have an additional statutory problem.  You have two sets of verbs in this statute.  One is the ""give and accept"" set of verbs and then the other is the ""charge made or received"".  So it seems to me that what this statute is thinking about is at first that there's a charge made or received, and that charge is, of course, the charge that the consumer pays to the provider.  And then there's another transaction.  And that transaction is the ""give or accept"" transaction, and that transaction occurs between two service providers.  So one set of verbs refers to the consumer-provider relationship, the other set of verbs refers to the provider-provider relationship.   ",10-1042

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, if that is the case, then why would Congress have done something that says, A, pursuant to an agreement, B, not pursuant to an agreement?  Why wouldn't it just have one provision that didn't make any reference to an agreement?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Hefferon, I don't think that is true that -- we defer to agencies, not because we think that agencies do statutory interpretation in exactly the way courts do.  We actually defer to agencies because we think they provide something different, not because they are the best parser of statutory language, but because when they see ambiguity they are able to import policy judgments into that ambiguity.  And that seems to me exactly what the agency did here.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Hefferon, you might be right that we never get to Chevron deference here because the statute is plain on its face, and there's no ambiguity for the -- the agency to think or do anything about.  But let's just assume that there is ambiguity on the statute, and the question is whether to provide this interpretation with Chevron deference.  So then, what's your argument for why there should be no Chevron deference to this interpretation, given that the statute under which this interpretation was promulgated refers identically to regulations and interpretations as something that HUD gets to do?   Elena Kagan  That's just a way of saying that there's no ambiguity here.  But I was suggesting that if there is ambiguity here, I -- at least I have not found a reason not to give HUD deference in this situation.  I mean, you say they didn't do a very good job.

1,"Elena Kagan  Is there -- Mr. Shapiro, is there a patent that Prometheus could have written that you think would have met the 101 test.   Elena Kagan  So if they had added a treatment protocol that would have been a completely different case?   Elena Kagan  And what makes it a completely different case?   Elena Kagan  Well, I think I'm not sure I understand that.  You said a specific number.  But suppose it uses ranges, but it also attaches treatment decisions to those ranges?   Elena Kagan  So if the idea--   Elena Kagan  --I guess the question -- the question I'm asking is, in your response to me is the difference the -- the extent of the ranges, or is the difference that there would be clear treatment decisions attached to those ranges?   Elena Kagan  But, General, I read you in part as saying: Don't worry, because if something strikes you as wrong with this patent, we are going to catch it under 102.  And I guess I'm not sure why that's true.  There was novelty here.  There were some doctors who figured out some new things, which was new ranges of effective drug treatment.  And so why do you think you are going to catch this as a 102 matter?  If there is a problem here, it seems to me not the fact that there was something new.  There was something new.  It's that -- it's something else.   Donald B. Verrilli, Jr.  But there was no new process, Justice Kagan.  There is exactly the same process that already exists, with a new inference drawn at the end, and that's why you can capture this under 102.  And I do think it's important to think about in terms of the points Mr. Shapiro is making, if this patent had involved, instead of standard old blood tests, had involved a breakthrough new test that allowed one to measure metabolite levels in a way that could never have been done before, of course the person who invented that could get this patent, even though it would have the excluding effect that Mr. Shapiro has identified.  Similarly, if the drug is a breakthrough drug and a patentable drug, any use of the drug during its patented period, including a use in a test like this, would be an infringement under 271.

What you haven't done is say at a certain number you should use a certain treatment, at another number you should use another treatment.  I guess the first question is why didn't you file a patent like that?  Because that clearly would have been patentable.  Everybody agrees with that.   Elena Kagan  And I think that the difference that people are noting or some people are noting is that this is not a treatment protocol, it's not a treatment regimen, all you have done is pointed out a set of facts that exist in the world, that exist in the world, and are claiming protection for something that anybody can try to make use of in any way and you are saying you have to pay us.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Bibas, how is it different then from a felon in possession statute, where you look at the past offense--   Elena Kagan  --and then you say, well, this man, because of that past offense, can't buy a gun in the future?  How is it different at all?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why isn't the -- the government, Congress, making the exact judgment same judgment here?  If the activity to be regulated is entry and Congress is making a judgment that we do not want dangerous people to enter, and we're using the conviction, the prior conviction, as a marker for who was dangerous, and that's exactly what Congress has done in the felon in possession statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that event is the event that the government cares about, which is the entry into the country.  It's not as though the -- you know, the government says -- just picks an event at random and -- and makes it the trigger mechanism.  The government has picked the event that it wants to regulate, which is entry.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How do you explain St. Cyr if reliance isn't necessary?  St. Cyr is all about reliance.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, do you have any case in which a court has deemed its statute retroactive even though it wasn't triggered until the party took some further action?  Is there any case out there either from this Court or from another court where we've said it's retroactive even though it depends upon a future event.   ",10-1211
0,"Elena Kagan  What do you think the trigger to be?  Because in your brief you kept on talking about the trigger being the trip.  And I would have thought that you would have talked more about the activity being the attempt to enter the country.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's what is going to be important to the person, right?  It's not inadmissible and all the legal terms.  It's: Am I going to be able to make short trips to visit my mother?  Yes, you are going to be able to make short trips to visit your mother.  And then you wake up the next morning, and Congress has passed a statute, and now you are not able to take short trips to visit your mother.  So something very real has happened to the life of this person.   Elena Kagan  You are quite right, Mr. Miller, as a formal matter that that is true, that that's the words of the statute.  But how many times has the Department of Homeland Security tried to declare a person inadmissible on the basis of the commission of a crime without putting into evidence either a conviction or a guilty plea?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I can't imagine that it's like more than on one, you know, five fingers of your hand.  I mean, that's the way people prove crimes in this area, isn't it, by convictions or guilty pleas.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Or after trial or convictions by guilty pleas.   Elena Kagan  If, as a fact of the matter, the way the commission of crime is proved in this area is through showing a conviction, does your distinction stand up at all?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It -- it can't be right that it's ""any"" future conduct.  If -- if there's a trigger mechanism that is entirely random, you know, it's -- you can be deported if you've committed a crime of moral turpitude in the past, but not until you go to the movies on a Saturday.  Surely that would not change the analysis.   Elena Kagan  And how do we separate those two?  How do we decide that this is not that, and that it's instead something else, that it's a regulation of future conduct?   ",10-1211
0,"Elena Kagan  What kind of evidence is that, Ms. Anders?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So in the 145, an applicant can take all of his written affidavits and say: I want to present oral testimony, on these exact matters, but live?   Elena Kagan  But to the extent the substance of that testimony was something that he could have brought to the PTO, that testimony, in your view, would be out of bounds.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But then you really do go back to Justice Ginsburg's question because your understanding of what they wouldn't have a reasonable opportunity to present, I mean, it's very, very narrow.  It's a bunch of cumulative testimony that nobody would want to present and no judge would want to hear.  And other than that, you are basically saying in all circumstances, well, they could have done that in the PTO.  So then you have Justice Ginsburg's problem.  Which is, these are two channels that are exactly the same.   Elena Kagan  But I thought that your brief suggested that even with respect to that kind of evidence, a person can go back to the PTO.  Is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Morgan has very little to say about what types of evidence ought to be admitted in this proceeding.  And one thing we could do is to separate out these two things and say, you know, we think that there is a basis for one, for let's say giving the government a fairly deferential standard of review -- call it clear and convincing, call it thorough conviction -- but go the other way, rule against you on the evidentiary point, which Morgan says nothing about?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but I guess the compelling reason is the statutory language, and especially with respect to the admissibility of evidence question.  I mean, it -- the standard that you suggest just can't be derived from the statutory language, isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1219

1,"Elena Kagan  But what takes you out of that background rule in this case?  You don't have the two-pronged structure, which really did, as Justice Ginsburg said, drive the analysis when we -- when we talked about those provisions.  So that's not there.  So what takes you out of the default position, which is equitable tolling applies?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The--   Elena Kagan  --Right.  But I guess I'm still not understanding why, if you look at this provision, you would think of this as anything other than an ordinary statute of limitations.  What is it about this provisions -- or, I don't mean to -- to -- I mean, you can -- you can make structural arguments.  But -- but you know, what factors do you think in this provision makes it a statute of repose?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I could turn the argument around on you.  Congress surely knew how to write a statute of repose, because it did it in this statute, but it didn't do it with respect to these kinds of violations.  This statute of limitations, I'm going to call it, reads very differently from the two-pronged positions that we've interpreted in the past.   Elena Kagan  Judge Posner, Mr. Landau, has a theory for why it is that fraud is treated differently from the 16(b) offenses, and it's that it's much more important to prevent strategic behavior involving timing in fraud suits -- the stock price goes up, the stock price goes down -- whereas in these suits damages are fixed.  It doesn't really matter where you bring them, so it's not nearly as important to set a clear limit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you have one theory, which deals with culpability; and he has another theory, which deals with strategic behavior.  And I don't know how to pick between those two theories, to tell you the truth.  The text doesn't suggest which one Congress was thinking about.  And that puts me back, and let's look to this provision, and this provision looks like an ordinary vanilla statute of limitations.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Landau, if we were to agree with you on one or both of those two things, wouldn't the normal course be to remand?  And what's your best argument for why we should decide it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But is that right, Mr. Wall?  I mean, don't we usually look when we are thinking about equitable doctrines as to whether the defendant has clean hands?  You know, whether the defendant is culpable or not seems to matter a good deal when we are thinking about considerations of equity.   Jeffrey B. Wall  --Absolutely.  And I think in many fraud and concealment cases, where you are not talking about a duty of disclosure, either common law or statutorily, you do have affirmative misconduct.  But it's a different question when Congress has come in and told the defendants by law what they have to do.  For the defendant then to breach that statutory duty -- I think Congress has already told them what they have to do in this context.   Elena Kagan  But I think Mr. Landau's point -- it was a strong part of his brief, I think -- was that there was no reason why his clients would have thought that they had a disclosure obligation in the first place.  So it wasn't that they were looking at this disclosure application and saying: We don't feel like it.  They were saying: We're not covered by it.   Jeffrey B. Wall  That just goes to Justice Ginsburg's point, I think, which is that where a plaintiff can sufficiently plead a section 16(b) case at the motion to dismiss stage to survive dismissal under Iqbal and Twombly, everyone agrees that if you've got a 16(b) potential violation, you have got a reporting duty under 16(a).  You can't have liability for a trade under (b) that you weren't required to report under (a).  So if the plaintiff can sufficiently plead a case at the motion to dismiss stage under 16(b), by definition the plaintiff has sufficiently pleaded that the defendant violated a reporting obligation--   ",10-1261

Another position is just regardless of whether there's been a filing, if the person knew or should have known, if a reasonable person would have known, even if there were no filing, that's enough.   Elena Kagan  So that would be--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. -- Mr. Tilden, is there any other context in which we would extend the statute -- or we have extended or any court has extended a statute of limitations without requiring that the plaintiff be reasonably diligent?  Can you point to any other example of that?   INTERRUPTING ",10-1261

You think that the answer would be the same had the district court not made an inquiry 2 months earlier; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  So when is a district court required to engage in some kind of inquiry?   Elena Kagan  Well, I -- I was, again assuming as Justice Sotomayor was, that if we're in an interest of justice world, if that's the appropriate standard, when is the district -- when does the district court have to make an inquiry, and what kind of inquiry does he have to make?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you're -- I thought that that test was an alternative to the interest of justice standard.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Alito's question, but suppose the judge says to himself, even if the response comes in, yes, relations are terrible because the client wants the lawyers to -- to investigate a particular thing and the lawyers don't want to investigate that thing, the judge knows, it doesn't make a difference either way, because he is ready to issue his opinion.  And further investigation of this evidence is not going to change his mind as to any material issue.  Why should the judge not reject the motion?   Elena Kagan  Does your argument--   Elena Kagan  --Did -- does your argument depend on a notion that the evidence against the defendant was weak?  In other words, if there were a great deal of evidence against the defendant, would you be making the same argument, that the judge still had a duty to inquire?

I mean, if the idea is just, we gave them something, now they have to do whatever we say, you wouldn't accept that.

But I -- I frankly think you wouldn't.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the broader point, General Verrilli, isn't it, is that no matter -- even if you are right that there are many non-vague applications of this commission policy, that there is some amount of uncertainty and ABC finds itself in that area of uncertainty--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --because it turns out that nudity -- that there really -- sometimes it's allowed as to some body parts and sometimes it's not allowed, and the commission hadn't really said anything about it for 50 years, and the length of time doesn't seem to be what's indicative of anything, the kind of body part doesn't seem to be, with some limits, what is indicative of anything, so that ABC just didn't really know.

And, it's, you know, evident in the notion that this -- the way that this policy seems to work, it's like nobody can use dirty words or nudity except for Steven Spielberg and that there's a lot of room here for FCC enforcement on the basis of what speech they think is kind of nice and proper and good.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, at this point--   ",10-1320
0,"Elena Kagan  Where does it say that in the jury charge?   Elena Kagan  Well, as I understand what the Arkansas instructions said, what the instructions in this case said, is that the jury unanimously had to have a reasonable doubt on an offense before it could go down to the next offense.  So that's to say that the jury unanimously had to find what is -- what leads to an acquittal.  So the jury had to unanimously acquit on the greater offense before it could go down to the next.  And the instructions don't say anything about moving back up.  And this jury seems to take its responsibility under these instructions extraordinarily seriously.  This jury was instructing the judge on the instructions and about how they had to go down step by step and reach unanimity on the one before they could get to the next lowest down, so I guess I'm asking, why do you think under these instructions that the jury felt itself able to go back up?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The chief prosecutor kept saying: You all have to agree on this.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think if you look at what the court -- the judge said, what the prosecutor said, what the defense counsel said and then what the jury said, it's clear that they all thought that they had to unanimously agree on something before they could go to the next crime.  And, again, there is no suggestion in what anybody said that they could go back up.   Elena Kagan  Even if, general, even if you're not required -- and if you are required -- but even if you're not, here the jury comes back.  The jury tells the judge, we've unanimously reached acquittal on these two counts, at that point why doesn't the judge have an obligation -- you know, the judge sends them back for a half hour.  There is no reason to think that in that half hour they moved back up the scale.  There is every reason to think they just remained stuck where they were.  But even assuming that there is some conceivable possibility that they went back up, why doesn't the judge working with the manifest necessity standard have an obligation to say, well, what about it?  Did you?  Did you reach acquittal?  Did you reach a judgment on these two counts?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess -- General McDaniel, one question about what Arkansas law does is -- it seems a little bit as if it's trying to get the sweet of an acquittal for a State without the bitter.  So the sweet is an acquittal-first system where you force a jury to reach agreement on one thing before it goes to the next thing, makes compromised jury verdicts harder, and that's why a State might say we want an acquittal-first system.  The bitter that most States take with that is that they say, well, if we're forcing them to agree on these things and they agree on a verdict of not guilty, we're stuck with that.  Now, what Arkansas seems to run is a system in which it forces juries to agree on the greater charges before going to the less, but won't take the consequence of that, which is that sometimes they agree that on the greater charges, they're not guilty.   Elena Kagan  General, you mentioned Green and Price before, and those are the cases, of course, where there is a conviction on a lesser charge.  We don't know anything about the greater charge.  And then the conviction is overturned.  What the court says there is, well, we don't know anything, but we're going to make a reasonable assumption, and the reasonable -- no, I think it said a legitimate assumption.  The legitimate assumption that they acquitted on the greater charges before they went down to a lesser charge.  Now, it seems to me as though there are a hundred reasons why that might not be true.  The jury could have just gone to the lesser charge immediately as a compromise position without voting on the greater charge, but the court said, well, make a legitimate assumption.  So why isn't the same true here?  We're making a legitimate assumption.  I think, honestly, on the basis of much more than Green and Price had to work with, if you will, that the jury, in fact, acquitted of those greater offenses.   Elena Kagan  There was a verdict that eventually got overturned.  There was no verdict on the greater offenses.   ",10-1320
0,"Elena Kagan  But I thought Congress wanted the system to operate so that people just did it voluntarily without an award.   Elena Kagan  All right--   Elena Kagan  --I think the way the argument has gone so far is that we've all been saying this can't make sense, and you have been saying, as you have every right to say, yes, but this is what the statute says based on the ""newly awarded"" language.  But that does assume that ""newly awarded"" can't mean an entitlement.  And then you run up against some other statutory provisions where an award does seem to mean, not a formal compensation order, but instead an entitlement to funds.  So 908(d)(1), it seems as though the word 910(h)(1), it seems as though the word 933(b), which says ""award in a compensation order"", suggests that awards can be made in a formal order or awards can be made differently because of an entitlement that is automatically paid.  So I guess there are three places that it seems to me your reading of the word, your limited reading of the phrase ""newly awarded"", runs into problems in those three ways, and I'm left then thinking we should do what makes sense.

Is there any place in the U.S. Code where the word interpreters clearly encompasses written translators?   Elena Kagan  So in every other case where the U.S. Code uses the word ""interpreters"" means only oral translators, and that's the obvious way to use the word, but in this case we are supposed to reach a different conclusion?   Elena Kagan  I don't know, Mr. Himmelfarb.  Why is this any -- any different from than any other case in which we draw the line, and we find that the result of drawing the line is that we have created some close cases, cases that are near the line.  So, you know, just to give you an obvious example, the fact that there are some few minutes in every 24-hour period where's it's hard to say that something is night or day does not mean that there is no night and that there is not day.

One is imputation of domicile in the way we talked about, but there are other imputations that occur throughout the field of immigration law.  Some cut for the alien, some cut against the alien.  In the world of that practice and tradition, are you at least in a sphere in which there is ambiguity, in which the agency essentially has discretion to decide whether it wants to impute in this way?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But none of them are textually commanded, is that right?  I mean, they are all situations in which the agency has decided that there are good reasons to impute various factors.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Keisler, the Court did say that, but it's cut off from the Court's actual analysis in the case.  When the Court goes through injury and causation and redressability, the Court never refers to the statutory cause of action.   Elena Kagan  But the Court clearly understood that in Massachusetts v. EPA and said that it was enough, and I would think under traditional standing principles the standing there was actually harder to find because one had to go through the EPA first.  One had to say the EPA should regulate, and then the EPA would regulate, and then the question was would that reduce emissions levels?  Here the EPA is out of the picture.

0,"Elena Kagan  But it seems, General Katyal, that there also is no case where we've ever used this language of generalized grievance as a prudential matter rather than as an Article III matter.  So am I wrong about that?   Elena Kagan  But Newdow -- Newdow quoted the language of generalized grievance that came from Warth, but it didn't specifically pin anything on that language.   Elena Kagan  Well, General Katyal, how about the Aiken case, because in the Aiken case I think the government came in and made the same argument, that even though the injury was concrete, it was too generalized and therefore there should be no standing, the Court specifically rejected that argument both as to Article III and as to prudential standing.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, General Katyal, suppose that the EPA had decided not to issue the endangerment finding.  Would your argument still apply?   Elena Kagan  But if I insisted you answer the hypothetical I gave you, what would the answer be?  No endangerment finding.  Is there displacement?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I'm sorry, General, because I was understanding your answer differently, and maybe I misheard you, as saying that if there were no legislation here, you doubted that there was a Federal law cause of action.  Is that correct?   Elena Kagan  No, but as to whether the cause of action exists under Federal common law in a case like this, where you said it was so different from the other Federal common law cases that the Court has seen.   Elena Kagan  General, could I take you back on that last point to another threshold question, which is the political question doctrine?  Because a lot of your arguments really sound like prongs two and three from Baker v. Carr, but you say that we shouldn't go there, that we should instead address this matter on prudential standing grounds.  But the political question doctrine actually seems more natural, given the kinds of arguments you're making.  So why not?   Elena Kagan  But, General, they're usually facts that are determined by an administrative agency.  I mean, even just reading that part of your complaint, it sounds like the paradigmatic thing that administrative agencies do rather than courts.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if there were no and if there were no, we would be living in a different world.  There is an administrative agency and there is a Clean Air Act.   Elena Kagan  What if the EPA made a judgment, but it just was not the judgment that you liked?  Suppose that the EPA said: We've looked at stationary sources; we're not going to regulate.  Would that displace?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  General, do you think that you have a Federal common law cause of action against anybody in the world?  Your briefs talk a lot about how these are the five largest emissions producers, but I saw nothing in your theory to limit it to those five.  Is there something that you think limits it to large emissions producers rather than anybody in the world?   Elena Kagan  But, General, much of your argument depends on this notion that this suit is really like any other pollution suit, but all those other pollution suits that you've been talking about are much more localized affairs.  One factory emitting discharge into one stream.  They don't involve these kinds of national/international policy issues of the kind that this case does.  I mean, there's a huge gap, a chasm between the precedents you have and this case, isn't there?   ",10-174X

So one can look at a case like Marathon and say the problem there was that the president appointed the bankruptcy judges in a way that the president no longer does and that the district courts did not have the supervisory control over the bankruptcy judges in the way that they do now, and that that makes a constitutional difference.

1,"Elena Kagan  Could I -- can I stop you on the first?  You say mere outcome is not enough, reliability of the proceedings.  How does that fit with Kimmelman, where we said it, the right to effective assistance, does attach to suppression hearings, obviously where evidence would not make the proceedings more reliable?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I thought that the second part of the test asked about harm.  And here the person is sitting in prison for three times as long as he would have been sitting in prison had he had effective assistance of counsel at the plea bargaining stage.  So why doesn't that just meet the requirements of Strickland, both deficiency and prejudice?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Sounds like a good argument.   Elena Kagan  And outcome -- there is a different outcome here.  He is sitting in prison three times as long.  That's a different outcome.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, take the sentencing cases.  The sentencing cases, the determination of guilt is over and the question is, is this person sitting in jail for one day longer because his counsel was ineffective?  And if he is we would find prejudice there.  So why isn't the same thing true here?   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I don't understand that answer, because that answer seems to suggest that the assistance being provided was not ineffective.  But here, as Justice Ginsburg notes, you've conceded that the assistance is ineffective.  That assistance has led to a much, much, much longer sentence.  As opposed to some of the sentencing cases suggest that 24 hours is enough, this is 10 years or something; and that should be the end of the game, no?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I take it, then, Mr. Bursch, you would have the same answer if the State had never provided counsel at all.  So long as -- if the plea negotiations were all done between the prosecutor and the individual defendant, and the State refused to provide the individual defendant with counsel, but so long as the person in the end decided, oh, I don't like this plea, I'll go to trial, then it's all fine and dandy under the Sixth Amendment?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Jay, you don't contest that plea bargaining is a critical phase, entitling somebody to a lawyer and to an effective lawyer, do you.     Elena Kagan  Yes, because we have said that many times, isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What we have to recognize -- is that plea bargaining is a critical phase because about 98 percent of the action of the criminal justice system occurs in plea bargaining.  And to deprive somebody of a lawyer at that stage of the process, where 98 percent of the action occurs, is inconsistent with the Sixth Amendment.  That's what we've said.  Isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  So it's not a critical phase.  It's only a critical phase depending on the outcome of what happens at that phase?     INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Has -- have you ever seen a critical phase before in our Sixth Amendment jurisprudence where the right to a lawyer depends upon what happens during that critical phase, where if one outcome results there is no Sixth Amendment right, but if another outcome results there is?

Elena Kagan  Mr. Young, you suggested that even if the Seventh Circuit was correct, there would still be a difference because of ease of identification.  You can tell a horse is a horse and keep the horse away from the slaughterhouse.  Would it be possible to say the same thing about nonambulatory swine?  And I guess my question is, do nonambulatory swine usually become nonambulatory in transit or at the slaughterhouse, or could you identify such swine earlier?   Elena Kagan  Would it be possible--   Elena Kagan  --Does -- does that mean that a State could actually pass a law and create a facility, let's say, that says -- the law says the trucks have to stop at the State facility before it gets to the slaughterhouse, and at the State facility, we'll check to see whether there are nonambulatory animals, and make sure that those animals don't go on to the slaughterhouse.  Would a State be within its rights to do that?   ",10-224X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, is that true, Ms. Smith?  I thought that under the Federal program some of these animals could become meat, that under the Federal program you take a nonambulatory animal and you say, well, some of them might be condemned, but some of them are suspect, and if they are only suspect it may be that eventually they will be turned into meat.   Elena Kagan  But that's exactly where the California system diverges from the Federal system, because under the Federal system you separate the animal out and then you take a look at it and then you decide whether that animal can continue to go through the process and eventually become meat or whether you euthanize it.  So the California system commands an action that the Federal system say may be necessary but may not be.   Elena Kagan  Well, but the Federal system has said maybe they should be part of the meat supply system.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So I suppose what you're saying, Ms. Smith, is that California or any State is entitled to take certain categories of animals outside of the whole process, to exclude certain categories of animals from the whole process and so to exclude them, if you will, from of the scope of this chapter.  And much as the Seventh Circuit said a State can simply exclude horses from the scope of this statute, you're saying a State can exclude nonambulatory swine from the scope of this statute.  But then you have to, you know, ask yourself the question: Are nonambulatory swine so easily excludable as horses.  Why couldn't the State then exclude swine with various kinds of diseases?  And then it would be clear that the State was doing something that the Federal statute is supposed to be doing.   Elena Kagan  But suppose, Ms. Smith, you decided that the Secretary was not doing a good job in terms of inspecting for disease.  So I guess that there is some disease called diamond skin disease which affects a lot of pigs, and you just thought that the inspection standards were far too lenient; and you said, okay we are not going to allow pigs with diamond skin disease to be slaughtered.  Under your theory you could do that, too, isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But in fact it requires a parallel inspection system.  It's trying to do the exact same thing that the Secretary is trying to do, which is trying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease, and it requires an inspection system of its own.

Suppose that there were, in fact, no deterrent effect on your speech or on the speech of any candidate; in other words, that people thought, well, you know, I would rather be -- have me be the only person who talks, but -- but I would rather talk than be silent, even if it means my opponent can talk, too, so that there's no deterrent effect from this law whatsoever.  Would there still be a constitutional objection?   Elena Kagan  Well, it constitutes a substantial burden, so even if every single person makes a choice, yes, I want to continue to speak, it does not chill any speak -- any speech.  I suppose I'm not sure what it means to constitute a substantial burden if, in fact, the law does not chill speech.   Elena Kagan  But, in fact, there's no such restriction here, is there, Mr. Maurer?  There's no restriction at all here; it's more speech all the way around?   Elena Kagan  Well, doesn't the government actually just give a selective subsidy?  It's not a penalty, it's just saying, in order to -- to run an effective public financing system, when you speak, we're going to give a subsidy over a certain amount.  So the trigger does not trigger a penalty; it triggers a subsidy.   Elena Kagan  There is, though, a significant difference between Davis and this case.  What the expenditure triggered in Davis was a discriminatory restriction that would never be allowed in and of itself.  What the law triggers here is something that, as Justice Ginsburg said, the government could do from the get-go, which is subsidize the speech of a candidate who decides to participate in a public financing system.   Elena Kagan  But there's no particular as-applied challenge from independent speakers in this lawsuit, is there?   Elena Kagan  My -- my understanding was that the suit was brought as a facial challenge to the entire law.   Elena Kagan  But that's interesting, Mr. Maurer, because I don't see all that much of a difference between Justice Alito's hypothetical and the facts here.  In other words, you said that Justice Alito's hypothetical would be constitutional, even though under Justice Alito's hypothetical the State is trying to figure out how much money it takes to run a competitive race and giving people who enter the public financing system that amount of money.  That's exactly what the State is doing here, but it's doing it in actually a more accurate way.  So if Justice Alito's hypothetical is constitutional, why isn't this?  They're both trying to do the same thing, which is to put sufficient money in the hands of people who enter the public financing system in order to run a competitive race.   Elena Kagan  Well, I think, to the contrary, in Justice Alito's hypothetical, just the State is estimating how much a person will spend.  Here the State is measuring how much a person will spend.  The only difference is that one is more accurate than the other.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think the purpose of this law is to prevent corruption.  That's what the purpose of all public financing systems are.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Maurer, some people may use certain buzz words and other people don't use those buzz words, but isn't it true that for 40 years what public financing systems have been based upon is the idea that when there is a lot of private money floating around the political system, that candidates and then public office holders get beholden to various people who are giving that money and make actions based on how much they receive from those people, and that's the idea of a public financing system is to try to prevent that?

I think their argument was that the common policy was one of complete subjectivity, was one of using factors that allowed gender discrimination to come into all employment decisions.  And in Watson, we suggested that that was a policy, a policy of using subjective factors only, when making employment decisions.  That's exactly the policy that was alleged here.

Once he pleads guilty, it just wipes away the fact that no counsel has been appointed for him.   Elena Kagan  So does that mean, Mr. Yang, a State could set up a system where it says we are going to do all our negotiating with the defendant with no counsel present in the room, but we are going to keep a lawyer on board just in the courtroom to advise him whether he should plead -- to advise him about the plea that he struck, even though he struck this plea with no counsel in the room, and that would be perfectly okay?

This really has no power in the -- in the -- I mean, tell me if I am wrong, but--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --I mean, the paradoxical thing about your argument is that one, it makes us think that Congress was just being hypervigilant about this problem of making sure that tax evasion offenses were covered, even though tax evasion offenses almost always do involve fraud or deceit, but Congress was thinking about these hypothetical possibilities that maybe there was going to be some conviction out there that would not involve fraud or deceit, and so Congress is being super-careful about this.  And yet at the same time that Congress is being utterly careless, utterly clueless about the basic rule of statutory construction which is that one does not write superfluous language.

What if, in fact, when you look before Blake what you see is some amount of confusion; that the board sometimes was following the Blake rule, but that at other times individual judges or maybe the board itself were doing something different, because the individual circumstances suggested that they should, or just because they weren't so clear on the difference between these two approaches.  And then Blake comes along, and what Blake does is neither to change something dramatically nor to just reaffirm what was there, but in some sense to create a little bit of order out of chaos.  What would that do to your argument if that's the way one understood Blake?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fleming, the government says that it has an interest in treating people in deportation proceedings less favorable, if you will, than people in exclusion proceedings.  Do you dispute that broad premise that the government could develop a system which treated those two groups differently?   Elena Kagan  The government says that is not the case.  The government says that it does not treat those two groups differently.  Do you have evidence to the contrary?   ",10-694X
0,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Gannon, suppose this.  Suppose that on the exclusion side, you have this category of crimes of moral turpitude, and suppose in the deportation side -- which I think is right, you have a category called crimes of violence, and you also have a category called crimes of moral turpitude.  There is a time limit on that--   Elena Kagan  --That's right.  Suppose that you -- the government could have slotted manslaughter into either of those categories on the deportation side, and I understand that there is a dispute about whether it could have, but let's suppose it could have.  So if manslaughter is categorized on the deportation side as a crime of violence, you say it doesn't match with the category on the exclusion side.  But if the same crime is categorized in a different way by the government, then it does match on the exclusion side.  So what sense does that make, the government's decision about how to categorize a -- a given offense on the deportation side is going to determine whether a person gets relief?   Elena Kagan  But the Petitioner -- the Petitioner just says we look to manslaughter, and we ask whether that qualifies a person for relief on the exclusion side--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --But you are saying no, first, we have to put manslaughter in a category on the deportation side, and then we have to match that to the category on the exclusion side.  And what I'm asking you is kind of what sense does that make?  Doesn't everything depend on which category you put manslaughter into?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You are so far from the statute, Mr. Gannon, you can't even tell what's closer to the statute.  I mean, you are miles away from the statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But this isn't a question about the history, Mr. Gannon.

Elena Kagan  Mr. Srinivasan, there are two categories of materials here, one is the search for other guns and the other is the search for anything relating to gang membership.  If we think that those two categories present different questions, if we think that one is more beyond a balance than another, that an officer might have qualified immunity from let's say the guns but not the evidence of gang membership, what would happen in this case at that point?   Elena Kagan  I think the question, Mr. Srinivasan, is do you think that the current test, the test that's currently formulated, is sufficiently protective of police officers?  Or do you think that we need to change the test in order to give police officers the protection they need?   ",10-704X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Wolfson, it seems that many of the arguments on both sides are very fact-dependent in nature, that you are asking what inferences can be drawn reasonably from certain facts, from a particularly violent incident, from the use of a sawed-off shotgun, from the fact that this was not his home, from the fact that he was a gang member; and yet the cases that you cite to us as suggesting what a reasonable police officer should know, really are not cases that involve these facts at all.  They are cases that state very broad general propositions about Fourth Amendment law.  So how can you get from those cases to what you are saying a particular police officer in a particular set of circumstances ought to know?   Elena Kagan  But -- no.  But there seems to be a very large gap between what this police officer has to think about and the cases that you cite.   INTERRUPTING ",10-704X

Can she sue on that contract?   Elena Kagan  And now suppose that Congress passes a law and says every contract of this kind has to have such a provision in it.   Elena Kagan  Would she now have standing?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Panner, in response to Justice Scalia's questions and my questions, you are suggesting that there is a difference depending on what the source of the law is.  If the source of the right is a contract, there is one result.  If the source of the right is a statute, there is another result.  And I thought that that was very much -- that is -- that's very much inconsistent with our case law, and specifically with Lujan.   Elena Kagan  I'm not sure that that's the right understanding of her complaint.  She is saying: I don't have to prove those things because there's been a judgment made that these kinds of practices tend to decrease service and tend to increase price and therefore I don't have to prove those matters.  And that's the exact same judgment that is made in the trust cases, for example.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Counsel, I'm still having problems.   ",10-708X

1,"Elena Kagan  Do you think there is general jurisdiction over the parent?  If the consent were not in the picture, is there?  Does general jurisdiction go beyond State of incorporation, principal place of business?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Horwich, could I ask you a different kind of question, and I apologize in advanced for taking you a little bit far afield?  But -- but I wanted to ask you about a particular sentence in your brief that seems to have some relevance to, not the general jurisdiction question but some relevance to specific jurisdiction.  So this is on page 20.  You say:  ""If mere purposeful availment of commercial opportunities in a particular State, which is of course the test for a specific jurisdiction, if that purposeful availment were sufficient to subject an enterprise to the general jurisdiction of that State's courts, a corporation that sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States could potentially be brought to judgment in any State on any claim against it. ""  So I -- I take that -- I understand that to read that you think that it is purposeful availment that subjects a company to specific jurisdiction -- not to general jurisdiction, but to specific jurisdiction -- if a corporation sold its goods to an independent distributor intending that they be resold in all 50 States.

Elena Kagan  Rely on testimony, but rely on testimony exclusively; do you have he a cases that do that?

Can you go further?  In a suit based on other acts, could the grand jury testimony come in as evidence?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Perry, in your view, patent information is just the patent number and the expiration date, and that's all?   Elena Kagan  Is that just the patent number and the expiration date?   Elena Kagan  Well, why would anybody have created this counterclaim to fix the patent number and the expiration date when that can be done by way of the defense to a patent claim?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So your argument, Mr. Perry, is not just that the word ""correct"" does no work.  Your argument is that the entire provision no long does any work?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Perry, there are also horribles on the other side, of course.  I mean, here's -- there's -- there's the statute, and it has three provisions, and two of them are vague and one of them works against you.  One is an approved method.  I think, you know, you both go back and forth about it; it depends on context.  One is patent information, which, you know, maybe you are right, and maybe Mr. Hurst is right.  It's not really quite clear what it means to be under subsection (b) or (c).  The third is correct.  You basically read ""correct"" out of the statute.  So at best, this is an unclear statute from your point of view.  And then there is the question of what it allows you to do.  The statute read your way essentially allows you to unilaterally expand your patent in areas in which it's quite clear that your patent ought not to go -- does not go -- but allows you to do that.  So why should we read the statute so that it effects a purpose that is entirely antagonistic to the purpose that Congress had in passing this statute, given that the statute is at best from your perspective ambiguous?

0,"Elena Kagan  But there's every reason to think, Mr. Shah, that what Congress was worried about here was cases in which the bankruptcy plan would not be approved at all because there were very high capital gains taxes that would result from a sale; and that that was the problem that everybody was focused on, was making sure that farmers could take advantage of section 12.  So it's a little bit odd -- it's actually more than a little bit odd.  It's a lot odd to read the statutes to apply not in that context, but only as to people who have somehow managed to sell their property, you know, 18 months before going into bankruptcy.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How does that work, Mr. Shah, because this is the part of your argument that I have to say sort of tripped me up.   Elena Kagan  Because you define 2 years and 4 years after the phrase that you are trying to define.   Elena Kagan  So it must have been a very pressured Congress.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you are saying that as of 1978 there was kind of an idea in people's heads about this separate tax entity or at least in some people's heads, but that idea had never been converted into any statutory language.  And you are suggesting that we should take this phrase ""incurred by the estate"" and read it as if they were referring to something real that was in a statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can I ask another question--   Elena Kagan  --while we are on this, because the 1398, 1399 would suggest that we are looking to this separate taxable entity.  But if I understand correctly, in the corporate context the IRS actually does not look to that.  It looks to just the question of whose filing the tax return.  So if that's the case, aren't you, in that very large bankruptcy context, losing your textual anchor entirely?   Elena Kagan  Why would that be a problem?  You said that there would be a significant ripple effect and practical difficulties.  And I understand your argument about 13 shows that you have to do this and why would 13 be necessary if Petitioner were right, but you started out, I thought--   Elena Kagan  --by trying to show us that it would be a significant practical problem.

0,"Elena Kagan  Just to take a kind of nutty example, Ms. Millett, suppose that a judge took a piece of paper and typed the words ""certificate of appealability"" on top and issued it.  Still jurisdiction to take the appeal?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So what counts as a certificate of appealability is I guess the question.  All you need is those three words and then you have a certificate of appealability?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --to which jurisdiction attaches?   Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Millett, let's take a look at the text of 2244(d)(1).  It says limitation shall run from the latest of.  And then it gives four dates essentially, four sections, each of which produces a date, A, B, C and D.  And A is the one that's concerned here.  And A says the date on which the judgment becomes final and then it gives two ways by which a judgment can become final.  And the two ways are basically you lose or you quit, right.  You lose or you abandon your process.  So, I just don't understand your argument, quite honestly, because it seems to me that A says the date, a single date, on which the judgment becomes final.  When is that going to happen?  Well, for some people it's going to happen when they lose and for other people it's going to happen when they quit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Right.  Two ways for it to become final: They lose or they quit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There's no suggestion in section (a) that there is ever going to be a conflict between these two ways of a judgment becoming final.  There is no suggestion that one is going to have to pick between them.  Subsection (a) is most naturally read -- again it says ""the date"" -- as there is just going to be one date.  And some people, the date of finality is going, you know, it becomes final because they lose.  Other people, it becomes final because they quit.  But subsection (a) suggests a single date, not two dates which you then have to choose between.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't understand that, Miss Millett.  I mean the situation in this case is presented because the Petitioner here didn't seek review in the highest State court.  The situation is not presented because the Petitioner did not file a cert petition.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Let me make sure I understand you.  You're saying 99 percent don't file petitions in Texas's highest court?

1,"Elena Kagan  General Mitchell, but you that C(2) is not jurisdictional, is that correct?  You say that C(1) and C(3) are but C(2) is not?   Elena Kagan  If that's right, why?   Elena Kagan  But C(3) says: Shall indicate which specific issues satisfy the showing required by C(2).  It just seems as if all of these are a little bit of a piece and, you know, you can stop it at 1 or you can go on to 2 and 3.  But it seems to me sort of hard to make the jump here and leave 2 out of it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But then presume, General Mitchell, that he thinks that it does but he just forgot to write down speedy trial.  And the question is: Why that forgetting to write down speedy trial should make a difference here given that as Justice Ginsburg said, in any event the court of appeals couldn't reach it because of the procedural issue that it had to reach first.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  General, it seems to me that Ms. Millett's best argument is an argument just about the oddity of what would happen if we adopt your construction of the statute, which is that the time begins to run before a habeas petitioner actually can file a State habeas petition, and whether that's so odd as to make this a -- a wrong way to construe the statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms.--   Elena Kagan  --Ms. O'Connell, could I just clarify your argument?  You disagree with the State of Texas, isn't that right?  Because you think (c)(1), (c)(2) and (c)(3) are all jurisdictional; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  So, I mean, (c)(2) is -- it appears to be a substantive inquiry jurisdictional, that in any case the court is going to have to make this -- is going to have to ask itself whether a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right has been made, and that would seem to be a very odd thing to do for jurisdictional purposes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But in most cases the Federal question inquiry is just look, I'm looking at your complaint; do you cite a Federal statute?  Do you cite a Federal constitutional provision?  If so, there's a Federal question in the case.  What (c)(2) says is have you made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right?  That's a very different inquiry.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well is it a jurisdictional rule that we're -- rule that we're going to presume that it's been satisfied?  That's a sort of odd thing to do for jurisdictional rules.  Right?  Jurisdictional rules, we sua sponte have to look at them and we have to be serious about them.   ",10-895X
1,"Elena Kagan  But, Ms. O'Connell, where does that outer limit come from?  You suggested looking to that statute as an analogy, but there would be no outer limit in application of that statute, would there?   Elena Kagan  General, could I ask you, you have been arguing on two different axes.  One is how tight the standard should be to grant any stay at all, and the other is what limits there should be on how long a stay can be if a stay is warranted.  And I'm just curious, if I forced you to prioritize in terms of the state's interests in effective habeas adjudication, which is more important, you know, cranking up the standard, or making sure that there is a time limit in place?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But ordered in that way, that, for you, the time limit is the more important?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, I know.  But, really, I said, if I forced you to prioritize between the two.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What situations would they be appropriate in?   Elena Kagan  Ms. Schimmer, if you are right that no stay was appropriate in these circumstances, we would never reach the question of how much of a stay is appropriate in other circumstances.  Isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  I'm saying the exact opposite.   Elena Kagan  In other words, if there was one bright line which says that stays are not appropriate in a record-based claim because there's really nothing that the client can contribute, then we'd have no need or cause to reach the second question of what happens, in a case where a stay might be appropriate, how long that stay should be.   Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Schimmer, why would that be?  I mean, assume a case where you say a stay would be appropriate.  So it's not a closed record case; it's a case where the client might be expected to provide information that's -- let's assume it's necessary to a full and fair adjudication of the habeas claim.  Why would you cut it off at a year?  Why wouldn't it be still true in 2 years, that a full and fair adjudication couldn't take place in those circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's not an indefinite stay.  I think the judge would do what the Chief Justice suggested, that, you know, it's not for ever and ever.  We're just going to come back to it periodically.

0,"Elena Kagan  General Verrilli--   Elena Kagan  --But, General Verrilli, this statute greatly expands the government's surveillance power.  Nobody denies that.  And so if the question from these lawyers' perspective is, what chance do I have of being overheard, and what precautions do I have to take, this statute makes them think about that question in an entirely different way, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, but if you take the baseline position before this statute and the position after this statute, these lawyers and other people in their situation are going to understand that this is just true, that the government is intercepting more material, and that they have to take greater precautions in order to keep their conversations confidential, if that's what they want to do, which lawyers want to do.  So they're going to take precautions that they wouldn't have had to take the day before this statute was passed, it seems to me, just from a kind of commonsensical point of view.   Elena Kagan  I guess I don't see why, General Verrilli, this case is any different from Monsanto.  In Monsanto, the government deregulates genetically modified alfalfa, says, go plant it.  Now, there were these farmers who were complaining, and they said, we don't know if that will contaminate our crops or not; we think that there's a significant risk that it will contaminate our crops.  Because we think that there's that significant risk, we have to take precautions.  Now, why isn't that exactly what's happening in this case?  We now think, says the -- say the lawyers, that there is a significant risk that our conversations will be surveilled, a risk that didn't exist before.  Because of that significant risk, we have to take precautions of the exact same kind that the farmers in Monsanto took; therefore, there is standing.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't see that difference at all, General Verrilli--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --because, in fact, what Monsanto did -- it's not Congress; it's an agency -- but the agency issued a rule saying that farmers could go plant genetically modified crops.  And then there was the question whether, because of that, essentially, delegation of authority, the plaintiffs in that case were going to be burdened.  And the plaintiffs said, you know, we might be harmed, and we have to take precautions in order not to be harmed.  So it's the same thing.  It's a different actor, but it's a delegation of authority and a -- and a fear that that delegation of authority will result in harm leading to a set of precautions.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, is it really such speculation, General?  I mean, just imagine that -- yourself in this lawyer's position, and the lawyer says, I'm representing a person associated with a terrorist organization, I'm representing KLM in the case of one of these lawyers, and I'm going to be talking to that person's family members and associates and trying to find out everything that I can.  Now, as a lawyer, would you take precautions, or would you pick up the phone and start writing e-mails to all those people?   Elena Kagan  I don't even think it has to do with an ethics rule.  If you're a good lawyer -- forget the ethics rule and how the ethics rules apply.  Are you really going to tell me that you, as a lawyer, would just pick up the phone in the face of this statute and talk to these terrorists' associates?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  In Summers, the Court said--   Elena Kagan  --Excuse me.  In Summers, the Court said, well, we don't know that this person is just going to stumble upon a piece of land that's affected by this government action.  I asked you a different question.  You're a lawyer representing a terrorist and talking to the terrorist's affiliates, and the question is, is this statute going to make you not use the e-mail in the way that you ordinarily would use the e-mail?   Elena Kagan  That's a fair point, General.  What if it said something different?  What if she said -- what if there were even an affidavit from the source saying,  ""I have stopped talking with this journalist because of the FAA and because of my fear that my communications will be intercepted?

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Jaffer, it seems to me that your -- the government's strongest argument goes something like this -- and I don't think that they would say it in these words, but you have some clients where it actually does seem completely reasonable that they would take precautions, that they would not get on the phone, and that they would not use e-mail in the way that any old person would.  But just -- those clients, these lawyers of terrorists, essentially shouldn't be using that e-mail or getting on the phone anyway.  Even before the FAA was passed, they would have been wise and, indeed, maybe ethically required to use precautions.  So what does the FAA do?

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, it seems as though it's more than housekeeping issue that's involved here because -- I mean, I realize that you have an argument about what happens when the plaintiff's individual claims have been fully satisfied, but the plaintiff continues to want to represent other individuals.  But, here, the plaintiff's individual claims have not been fully satisfied.  She walked away with nothing.  She walked away with no judgment, and she walked away with no $7,500.  And the question is: How can it possibly be that her individual claim was moot?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Here is what the Court said last in Knox last year, when it said: “ What makes a case moot ”?  It says:  ""A case becomes moot when it's impossible for a court to grant any effectual relief whatever to the prevailing party. ""  Now, here the judge says: Okay, is this case moot?  Well, it's not moot because I could give -- at the very least, I could give the plaintiff $7500; but, I didn't give the plaintiff $7500, so she still has her claim for at least $7500, regardless of the collective side of this action.

1,"Elena Kagan  What do you think the court should do in that circumstance, where a defendant comes forward and says, I'm willing to satisfy the entire claim?  What should happen?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is this under Rule 68 or is this under some inherent authority?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal, if we do get to the question that Mr. Mann wants us to raise, you spend a lot of time talking about McLaughlin and talking about Gerstein.  Those cases were about prospective relief.  You're asking for retrospective relief.  Why doesn't that make a difference?   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Yang, do you think it would be -- I -- I mean, I take the point completely that judgment was rendered against the wrong party here.  But if the judgment had been rendered against Ms. Symczyk -- for Ms. Symczyk, but -- but the court had done so prior to looking at the whole class question--   Elena Kagan  --do you think that that would be an abuse of the court's discretion?  Do you think that the court has to look at the class question before rendering judgment for an individual plaintiff?   ",11-1059
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, that's just to say that a plaintiff can always relitigate the question of materiality.  But at the class certification stage, isn't it correct that if the Court holds that a statement is immaterial, it's immaterial for all members of the class, and the suit has to be dismissed?  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It can't proceed as an anything action, can it?  I mean, the -- the remedy, if you had thought that the statement was immaterial, is not to say, I won't approve a class.  It would be to say the suit has no merit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, do you mean to say that a judge who has just ruled that a statement is immaterial is going to keep the case in his court litigated by an individual plaintiff, even though he's just ruled that the statement is immaterial?   Elena Kagan  So you're saying that a judge on a class certification stage can say: This is immaterial, the statement is immaterial; therefore, this can't proceed as a class action.  But when a summary judgment motion comes in arguing the exact same thing, the judge will say: Oh, it's not immaterial after all, or it's disputed enough that the case can continue?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess the question, Mr. Waxman, is if it is not immaterial as a matter of law at the summary judgment stage, how could a judge possibly say it is material at the class certification stage?   Elena Kagan  So the class certification stage becomes kind of a super merits inquiry?   Elena Kagan  --where the plaintiff has to -- has to surmount a higher burden on the merits?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, that is right, and that's what we said in Walmart recently, that the question is a question of coherence; it's a question of whether the class wins or loses together.  And here, for materiality, the class wins or loses together.  If it's material, it's material as to everybody.  If it's not material it's not material as to everybody.  And that's just a function of the fact that materiality, as we've repeatedly said, is an objective test.  It doesn't have anything to do with whether a particular person finds it material.  And where that's the case, it seems to me that the Walmart test, which is, is an issue central to the -- you know, when you rule on the issue, do you rule on each of the claims in one stroke?  The answer to that is yes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, I was saying that's right.   Elena Kagan  There is class cohesion as to materiality.  People win or lose on materiality together.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What is that statement, Mr. Waxman?   Elena Kagan  Because the difference is if there is an insufficient market, the case goes forward and people have to prove individual reliance, and that means that the class splits apart and you don't get a coherent class.  So the function of your winning an argument either on publicity or on the efficient market is that the class becomes incoherent, that everybody then has to prove individual reliance.  But that's not what happens when you prove immateriality.  When you prove immateriality, the whole class falls together, because it's immaterial for everybody.   ",11-1085

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Horwich, could I just -- before you give examples, just make sure I understand your basic position.  Suppose this statement said very clearly that these hospital authorities had the power to engage in acquisitions of hospitals that, for a normal actor, would violate the antitrust laws, but -- but basically said the hospital authorities had the discretion to do that or not.  And the state didn't know the hospital authority might do it, but it also might not do it.  That would be subject to the immunity; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  The sheer grant of authority, but the authority is completely discretionary.  So the state is basically saying, we don't know; we're going to let the hospital authority figure it out.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What I'm trying to get at is the state has put it on the table only as a completely discretionary action.  The state has not expressed a preference for it.  The state has only said that the hospital authority can think about conditions on the ground in its particular locality and can decide whether such an anticompetitive acquisition is appropriate.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So all of this language--   Elena Kagan  --So all this language in your brief about necessarily and inherently and compelled, all of those things really are not part of your -- your governing test.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1160
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, we do have a brief from quite a number of states, and the brief basically says: We do this all the time; we set up these local authorities, and then we give them powers because they have to act in the world.  We give them normal powers, like the ability to make contracts and the ability to buy property.  And when we do that, we don't mean that they can do anything they want notwithstanding the antitrust laws.  And to construe these very normal powers that we would give to a state entity in order to allow it to operate as a permission to violate the antitrust laws is not at all consistent with our own intentions.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, could I understand where you think this expressed approval is coming from?  Because you said general corporate powers is not enough.  So the general ability to buy property, you said, is insufficient.  Then you have this idea they have a mission.  But the mission can be accomplished in all kinds of ways that are perfectly consistent with the antitrust laws, so that doesn't seem to get you all that far.  So what else have you got to show that the State actually thought about this issue and approved this power for the hospital authorities?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, I mean, that's right, it is about choices, but -- but the question is whether the state has made a choice.  And that's what all these cases are about--   Elena Kagan  --is our trying to find whether the state has made a choice as to this kind of conduct.   Elena Kagan  So now we have your corporate powers aren't enough, your general mission isn't enough.  You said a certificate of need, but a certificate of need isn't even given out by this authority.  It's something that has nothing to do with the powers of this authority.  Then you said there's some kind of a price regulation that happens as to the hospitals that the authority owns, but not with respect to other hospitals.  So I guess I'm still looking for the things that show that the state has made a choice that it wants these -- these hospital authorities to be able to make anticompetitive purchases.  Where do I find that?   ",11-1160
1,"Elena Kagan  I understood Ms. Blatt to actually agree with that, that if you put Rule 54 aside, this does say,  ""You may, under a certain set of conditions. ""  which implies you may not, under -- if those conditions are not met.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1175
0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Blatt, it -- it seems to me that the -- the most natural way to read this statute, and it's not -- it's not your way, it's, look, we have this Federal Rule of Civil Procedure that -- that contemplates that Congress sometimes doesn't write -- it writes statutes authorizing lawsuits without providing a cost provision.  And because we know that about Congress, we provide a default rule.  And the default rule is what's laid out in subsection D as to costs and then also later as to attorney's fees.  But, we know that Congress sometimes does address costs and fees, and where Congress in a particular statute has addressed costs and fees, we look to whatever Congress has said, you know, unless Congress has otherwise provided.  And here this is -- 1692k is a provision that addresses costs and fees.  It addresses them comprehensively and specifically.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I expected you might.  [Laughter]   Elena Kagan  It's not a question of field preemption.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Maybe I'm--   Elena Kagan  --not in the business of trying to figure out what Congress's intent is.  All I'm trying to figure out is whether this Federal statute provides otherwise, and this Federal statute does provide otherwise.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's both.  You know?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And if I might say, I mean, you object to this statute; it's perfectly reasonable to say Congress should have written a separate provision about costs and attorney's fees, but for whatever bad, good or indifferent reason, Congress didn't; and so this statute basically says, here's what prevailing plaintiffs get as to both costs and fees; here is what prevailing defendants get--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --under what circumstances, as to both costs and fees, and those are the rules.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  This statute is very -- is very normal if it were just about fees, right?  It would be just like the civil rights fees statutes, where it said prevailing plaintiffs get fees, but prevailing defendants only get fees upon some higher standard, here bad faith.  What makes this statute different, and it is different, is that this statute twice says not only fees but also costs.   Elena Kagan  Now you might say that's very uncommon, but in both sentences it says, we want the same rule for costs as we do for fees.   Elena Kagan  Sorry.  I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Well, you say that, but it says to both.  It says the costs together with the reasonable attorney's fees, and then the next sentence it says fees and costs.  So you might wish that they were a different statute, and it might be good policy to have a different statute--   Elena Kagan  --I'm not in the business -- I'm not in the business of trying to figure out exactly what Congress is doing.  I'm in the business of just reading what Congress did; and what Congress did is it created a set of rules that applies to attorney's fees and costs at the same time.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That sounds very terrible.   Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Blatt, you say it -- it's supposed to make defendants better off by focusing on just part of the provision, but the provision is -- as a whole, it does a set of things.  It treats plaintiffs and prevailing plaintiffs in a certain set of ways, and it treats prevailing defendants in a certain set of ways.   Elena Kagan  Prevailing defendants, but when -- prevailing defendants are treated worse than prevailing plaintiffs, because they have to show that there is a bad faith lawsuit.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Blatt, let me try it a different way.   Elena Kagan  Let's just suppose that 54(k) didn't exist at all.   Elena Kagan  54(d) didn't exist.   Elena Kagan  And all you had was this provision, okay?   Elena Kagan  So this provision says on a finding by the court that it's brought in bad faith, the court may award to the defendant attorney's fees and costs.  So suppose a defendant wins, but there's not a finding that it was made in bad faith, would then the person be entitled to either attorney's fees or costs?   Elena Kagan  I'm saying that--   Elena Kagan  --In my world, you would not get fees or costs.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm just asking you a simple question.   Elena Kagan  You would not get costs under that provision.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So if you would not get costs under that provision--   Elena Kagan  --under 1692, a provision that talks about fees and costs generally as to both plaintiffs and defendants, then how does a rule that says what -- where you would get costs unless a Federal statute provides otherwise change matters?   Elena Kagan  You might be right, but suppose Congress wasn't thinking about Rule 54.  Suppose it didn't occur to the drafters what Rule 54 said or what the default provision was.  They just wrote a statute about fees and costs.  And then -- it doesn't really matter whether they were thinking about Rule 54 or not.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's -- that's just a different way of saying the following: The first sentence says, when you're a prevailing plaintiff, you get costs and fees.  How about defendants?  Well, prevailing is not enough for defendants.  Defendants have to show--   Elena Kagan  --that the suit was filed in bad faith--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --and then they get costs and fees.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I completely agree with that.  But that's what it comes down to, that if you think that Congress has to use super extraordinary language to over -- to -- to get out of 54(d), then you're right.  But 54(d) doesn't say that.

Because in Henderson, of course, we dropped a footnote saying that we weren't deciding whether equitable tolling was available.

Could the Secretary of Veterans Affairs then go on and say, okay, it's a claims processing rule, but, still, we get to decide how much equitable tolling we want, and we're going to adopt a regulation, much like the one in this case, saying you can't come in after 3 years?  Could you do that in Henderson?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess the question I was trying to ask, Mr. Kneedler, was do you think it's a general principle of administrative law that when there is a claims processing rule that relates only to internal agency process, that the agency gets to decide how much, if any, equitable tolling to allow?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, you don't need that label, do you, Mr. Kneedler?  You could do just as well with a claims processing label.

0,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Roth, on the legal question here, I think Justice Breyer is right that this all comes down to congressional intent, how we read this statute.  One response to reading the briefs in this case is that you and Mr. Manning present opposite views of the statute and both of you say the statute is clear as to your opposite view.  In other words, Mr. Manning says the statute clearly prohibits equitable tolling and you say the statute clearly requires equitable tolling.  And both of you have kind of decent arguments, and one response to that might be to say Mr. Kneedler is right that the statute is just ambiguous and that it can be read a bunch of different ways, and both of you have presented good arguments, but in the end it really all goes to show that there is a lack of clarity here and then it's up to the agency to decide.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Roth, I'm not certain about the extent of your argument, so let me -- let me try something.  Are you saying that any time Congress passes a statute saying, you know, there is 30 days to do this, there is 60 days to do this, in the agency context now as to administrative process, that Congress necessarily means that equitable tolling applies and that the agency cannot limit that equitable tolling?   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm not sure I understand this, Mr. Roth.  Are you saying that in all of our cases about the presumption in favor of equitable tolling, when we talk about equitable tolling we are only talking about misconduct or fraud cases?  You know, as opposed to the case where it's just a person cannot possibly know the -- the information that would back up a claim, and that we regard that as a good excuse.   Elena Kagan  Right.   Elena Kagan  Well, that most of your argument was built on the presumption in favor of equitable tolling that we've recognized in those cases--   Elena Kagan  --and whether it applied to the agency context.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Liman, what you suggested, when we talked about the discovery rule, is that it has a basis in the notion that a defendant with unclean hands who has committed deceptive conduct preventing the plaintiff from understanding that he or it has a cause of action, you know, shouldn't be entitled to the benefit of a statute of limitations.  And if that's the understanding that lies behind the discovery rule, I guess the question for you is, why doesn't it apply in this case as well as in the case where the person bringing the action has himself suffered a harm?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It is true, though, isn't it, that Justice Scalia pointed to an anomaly that could easily exist in other contexts, because this isn't only a statute about securities violations.  So that you might have in other contexts in which this statute applies a world in which a private individual could sue, but the government -- could sue after the -- the period of time--   Elena Kagan  --the 5 years, but the government could not.

And this case actually seems to me a good example when Mr. Liman said there's no natural starting point and Justice Kennedy and Justice Alito referred to just -- this is a -- this is a decision about enforcement priorities.  The Government had decided not to go after market timers.  And it changed its decision when a State attorney general decided to do it, and it embarrassed them that they had made that enforcement priority decision, and then the Government made a different enforcement priority decision.

This provision is there to -- to prevent people from drawing a mistaken inference.  And the inference would be that the doctors were liable because the government was not.  Now, there are a thousand ways to do that pretty clearly.  You could just say: Irrespective of whether the government is liable, the doctors are not, or some such thing.   Elena Kagan  But instead what Congress did was it enacted a kind of let's pretend provision, right?  Let's pretend that the government is liable, so then the inference won't arise.

You said, you know, we should reach the results that you wanted in Smith because 1089(e) would continue to have this effect.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It was a supportive argument.  I am not saying that it was the but-for argument, but it was clearly a supportive argument in your brief.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Shah, your basic theory of the case, which is that in order to make absolutely certain that everyone gets the benefit of the intentional tort exception, both the government and individual doctors, in order to make that absolutely clear, Congress writes a provision saying that the intentional tort exception shall not apply.  Now -- I mean, the position, I have to say, seems to refute itself.  If Congress wanted to make absolutely clear that the intentional tort exception would apply, it wouldn't have written a provision saying that it doesn't apply.   INTERRUPTING ",11-1351
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Stewart, don't you have two arguments?  One is that the statute changed, but the other is that even the statute remains the -- even if the statute remained the same, Colony itself was a decision that found ambiguity in the statute, so you have the power under Brand X to go back to that statute and reinterpret it, if you will?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if the Court thinks it has to reach that question because it agrees more with Justice Scalia than with you as to whether this statute stays the same, then you have independent Brand X arguments, don't you?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Stewart, prior to this latest round of litigation, had the IRS ever said, ever given any indication, that it viewed Colony as not controlling any -- any -- any longer?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And as a result of this case, the IRS suggested in any kind of guidance or rulings or anything else that it viewed Colony as an outdated decision?  Because, you know, I'm a taxpayer and I'm reading Colony, and I'm thinking the language of the statute is still the same; why wouldn't Colony control?   INTERRUPTING ",11-139X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, why do you think they added that paragraph?  Because it seems clear that there was a circuit split at that time about exactly this question and that this paragraph was a response to that circuit split.  So what else could Congress have meant by it?   Elena Kagan  But you agree that that's not why Congress passed that provision?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Garre where do you find evidence of that?  Because you cite some cases in your brief that end up not really supporting your position.  And as far as I can see there is only one case after Colony that deals with the question of whether Colony continues to govern after the 1954 amendments.  And that case, which is Phinney, seems to cut in the opposite direction.  So am I missing something?  Are there cases that favor you that say that yes, Colony continues to control?   Elena Kagan  Well, whatever the Fifth Circuit said about Phinney, when I read Phinney, it seems to me to cut in the government's direction if not to be entirely on all fours.  But I ask are there any other cases that you have that suggests that courts did think that Colony was continuing to be the governing rule?   Elena Kagan  Because what I was thinking, Mr. Garre, and tell me what you think the consequence of this would be, is that if I were a taxpayer and somebody came to me and said is Colony still the rule, I would have said, well, I can't tell you 100 percent.  I think you are good 70 to 80 percent, you know.  It's the same language, and there's Colony out there, and nothing the IRS hasn't said that Colony doesn't control, but I can't -- so I'm giving you 70 percent.  Do you win if that's the state of the world as I see it?   Elena Kagan  Well, in terms of what a taxpayer thinks, whether Colony continues to govern.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that was the specific situation, but then the question was how clearly did Congress speak to that specific situation.  And in order to get his result, Justice Harlan says first that the statute is -- that the statutory text is ambiguous, goes to a bunch of legislative history, and none of that legislative history actually speaks to the exact question before the Court, only by implication.  So if you look at the whole of the Colony opinion, it sure seems as though there's a lot of extrapolation going on and essentially a lot of ambiguity.   Elena Kagan  Well, in the end there has to be a resolution.  But the question is, what does it look like before you get to that resolution?  And -- and Justice Harlan is doing a lot of tap dancing there, you know, going to this Senate report, going to that House report, going to this colloquy, before he can come up with an answer.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you -- do you understand the preamble as part of the regulation?  Because if I look at the preamble, the preamble seems pretty clear to me.  It seems to me that your view that the government did not do this clearly enough must rest on looking at the regulation without the preamble.   ",11-139X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Koester, suppose that, instead of waiting 2 hours, there were procedures in place in Missouri and, indeed, across the country where it was possible to get a warrant in these circumstances within 15 or 20 minutes.  Would you still be saying that there is a sufficient exigency to avoid the warrant requirement?   Elena Kagan  You suggest that 15 or 20 would be a different case.  I am wondering where you would draw the bright line.   Elena Kagan  Or maybe they're drunk.  But, but, but -- I mean, Justice Scalia raises a point, which is you always have some delay.  Unless you are talking about sticking a needle in somebody roadside, you have to take them to the hospital.  So there's going to be some amount of time which you're going to lose, and why can't you use that amount of time, if you can, to try to get a warrant?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Going back to Justice Scalia's question, if a person does take a breathalyzer, is there ever a reason for a warrantless blood test?   Elena Kagan  All this talk about, you know, losing evidence every second, I mean, I suppose the exact same thing could be said in other alcohol-related crimes, public drunkenness, underage drinking.  You wouldn't be making the same arguments there, would you?  Or would you?

Elena Kagan  So one could disagree with you and one could think, as Justice Alito and Justice Kennedy suggested, you know, you do take into account that it's the middle of the night in a rural county and it's going to take two hours, but still think, well, that's the analysis you had to go through.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Shapiro, Schmerber is an odd case, because Justice Ginsburg are exactly right, that they spend a lot of time talking about special facts, and particularly so, but then you read the opinion kind of backwards and forwards, and you can't find the special facts.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Beard, can I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question and make sure I understand your answer to it?  Suppose that the State just had a policy that said, we're concerned about wetlands; in order to develop your piece of property, you have to come forward with a proposal, a mitigation proposal, and an adequate mitigation proposal.  And then it gives some guidance about what an adequate mitigation proposal would mean, but it really leaves it up to the landowner.  And the landowner says, sorry, I'm not giving you anything.  I think I should be able to develop this on my own without providing any mitigation.  And the State says, well, then, sorry, you don't get a permit.  Is that a taking?  Does the man have a takings claim?  I heard you answer the question yes.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's the next question I was going to ask you, because my understanding of Nollan and Dolan was that it assumed the conditions, if taken alone, would constitute a taking.  Do you disagree with that?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So then you need a taking someplace in the picture.  Isn't that right?  Nollan-Dolan said this is how we analyze takings in the context of a permit scheme.  So we have to look for a taking.  So in my example, where is the taking?  This was Justice Ginsburg's example.   Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Beard, I don't think anybody is contesting that there was a condition imposed or maybe there are.  But -- you know, there's another question whether that position is a taking.  And we've been trying to figure out what's the taking here.  In Nollan and Dolan, they took an easement, they took a piece of land.  So that's the taking.  Now, you said the funds are the taking; is that correct?  Any time that somebody comes up with a proposal for -- for a developer to pay money in order to compensate the State for the costs that are associated with his development, that that is itself a taking?   Elena Kagan  No, I understand.  But in the permit context, a State can't say to somebody, You have to pay to perform some service or to compensate without it being a taking and without it being subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So -- so, for example, and I'll try to do this very quickly, if -- if the State just had a policy for every acre of wetlands you fill in, it costs us $10,000, you need to pay $10,000, that's subject to Nollan and Dolan analysis, too.

1,"Elena Kagan  You say what Congress is concerned about and point to the Senate report.  You know, usually we look to the text and the text makes very clear that Congress was concerned about many things and it did many things.  It got -- it really -- it raised the matter in controversy threshold.  It eliminated the Zahn anti-aggregation rule.  It eliminated the complete diversity requirement.  It eliminated the one-year limit on removal.  Here's one thing it didn't eliminate.  It didn't eliminate the St. Paul master of your complaint rule.  So I guess where in the text do you see this?  You point to claim, the word “ claim ”.  Is that the only thing that you are resting on in the text?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, if I said to you, Mr. Boutrous  ""Is your claim for over $100,000? ""  what would you think I mean?  Would you think I mean some sort of abstract version of the best claim you could bring, or would you think I mean what I demanded, what I asked for?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you think that the word “ claim ” is not -- when you say Joe made a claim for $100,000, a claim is not what he asked for, but is instead some kind of law professor's view of what the best thing that he could have asked for?   Elena Kagan  But he doesn't have power to affect those claims before the certification has happened.   Elena Kagan  Before the certification has happened, they can do whatever they want.  They can bring their own claim for $6 million.  And that's why Smith v. Bayer, which you so happily rely on, does not have much to do with this case.  Smith v. Bayer is the question -- can a person be precluded by a judgment when that person was not part of a class.  There's no question that this person is going to be precluded.  This person can go do whatever he or she wants before class certification and judgment.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Boutrous, that form of argument -- Congress could have said -- does seem to me to be much worse for your position.  If Congress had wanted to get rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule, it could have said: We are getting rid of the St. Paul master of your complaint rule.  But you're trying to find it in a position which is really an anti-Zahn position, not an anti-St.  Paul provision.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Let's get back to the Chief Justice's question, because there are a thousand ways in which we let the named plaintiff prior to certification construct a case, and then we ask, as Justice Sotomayor said, later we ask, is the way he's constructed a case adequate or not, and we allow him to go forward or not based on that.  But he gets to decide whether to seek damages.  He gets -- at all, or whether he only can seek injunctive relief.  He gets to decide which claims to bring, trespass or negligence.  He gets to decide how many years' worth to ask for.  He gets to decide which defendants to sue.  All of these things are going to have an effect on -- on the amount that's -- that's being asked for.  And yet in all of these ways, we allow for -- maybe you're telling me no -- do we stop the named plaintiff from doing all -- all of those things, too?   Elena Kagan  It's binding if the class is certified and the case proceeds to judgment.  It's not binding on the absent class members prior to certification and prior to judgment.   Elena Kagan  I think I don't understand that, Mr. Boutrous, because what you have, given that this is a State which says that these stipulations are binding if it proceeds, if there's certification and if it proceeds to judgment, you have a cap of $5 million.  You cannot be charged more than $5 million under this State's law, if this case ever gets to judgment.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Congress was concerned about suits of over $5 million.  And -- and the question here is, is this a suit of over $5 million.  Now, if it is a suit over $5 million, a State court is bound by the due process clause and a State court is going to find, look, you're just giving these plaintiffs' claims away.  We're not going to allow you to do that.  You're not an adequate representative.  On the other hand, in a case like this where it's $5,024,000 and it only gets there because you've added on one and a half million dollars of legal fees, the Court might very well say you are an adequate representative, go for it.  Now, usually we don't question State court judgments of that kind.  Why should we do so here?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Boutrous, as you think -- you have to be careful about two different uses of the word “ binding ”.  It has no binding effect right now on an absent class member; they can go out and bring their own suit.  If the -- the named plaintiff is found to be adequate and the suit goes forward and goes to judgment, then the stipulation does indeed have binding effect and -- and you have not been exposed to more than $5 million.   Elena Kagan  It's binding -- it is binding on everybody if there's a finding of adequate representation and if this goes forward as a class action; then it's binding and you haven't been exposed.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Boutrous, you know, a lot of your brief talks about this problem of discovery.  And it may very well be that there is a significant one, I don't know, but when you look at CAFA, I mean, CAFA did a lot of things.  And it did not address this problem that you have with discovery.  There could be -- I can give you, you know, ten different proposals that would enable you to bypass expensive discovery, but CAFA didn't do any of them.  And this is a kind of a jerry-rigged solution to get at a problem that Congress, in fact, did not address.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Boutrous, the idea of master of the complaint is inherent in every class litigation because there could be no class action, there could be no definition of anything, of the claims, of the amount of damages, of the number of defendants, of the amount of time unless the plaintiff, the named plaintiff, had some ability to define the claim.  And this is just one aspect of that larger power.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Then you really are asking us to blow up the whole world.   Elena Kagan  Because you're saying: Next time we will be back and tell you that the named plaintiff can't define the clans.  Next time we are going to be back and tell you that they can't name the defendants.   ",11-1450
0,"Elena Kagan  And they can remove no matter when that happen; is that right, as a result of CAFA, because CAFA took off the one year limit?   Elena Kagan  Can I ask you this, because I have been trying to figure out exactly what Mr. Boutrous is concerned about?  And one thing he might be concerned about is that, notwithstanding that the class has really plans for $20 million, the thing is going to be certified for $5 million, and all these absent class members are -- are being deprived of something meaningful to them.  But that's something which -- you know usually, we assume that State court judges will do their jobs, will pay attention to the Constitution, will apply adequacy of representation standards that come from the due process clause.  So that seems like a strange thing to worry about in interpreting this Federal statute.  The other possibility is that you might be worried that this stipulation won't be really as binding as you say, that in a case in which there is an adequacy of representation determination made, the class goes forward, and then things work out and it really looks like all these absent class members are going to get -- you know, badly treated.  He's going to tear this stipulation up or do something like that.  And it's going to be way down the line.  And why should we allow that to happen?   Elena Kagan  But this is -- he's done the certification, now it turns out that the certification was wrong, that in fact, these claims are worth a good deal more.  And he says, I can't in good faith allow all these people's claims to be adjudicated for this amount of money when I know they're worth five times as much.   ",11-1450

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Goldstein, at one level you are right.  It's just a level that doesn't help you very much.  I mean, it's true that always there is an initial question of whether an agency is entitled to Chevron deference.  But usually the way we answer that question is just this: We say is this the agency's organic statute?  Yes.  Does that organic statute provide the agency with lawmaking power?  Has the agency acted in accordance with that -- under that lawmaking power?  Well, then, the agency gets deference.  We go on to the next thing, which is Step 1 and Step 2.  So, you know, what we don't do is this sort of provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did Congress have a special intent as to this subject matter or that subject matter or the other subject matter?  We've just had some very simple rules about what gets you into the box where an agency is entitled to deference.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But take Meade, Mister -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Meade presented -- whatever you think of Meade, it's a very different question from this, because what the majority in Meade said was that the agency wasn't entitled to deference because it was acting by way of these opinion letters that weren't -- that didn't have the force of law.  So that's the threshold question is, does the agency have power to make rules with the force of law and is the agency exercising that power?  That is a threshold question that has been set by this Court.  It's a very different kind of question from provision by provision, subsection by subsection, did -- did Congress think that the agency had authority over this particular subject matter or not.

1,"Elena Kagan  But isn't there something sort of bizarre about your reading, because Congress in the (e) section sets up very specific definitions about stepchildren and grandchildren and even step-grandchildren in which State intestacy law is not referenced, but you are that saying that as to the largest category, the category in which 90 percent of people are going to get benefits, there Congress sent us all off to State law.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, suppose I'm not so convinced that (h) is as clear as you think it is because there are two sentences of -- of section (h).

Elena Kagan  Mr. Miller, could I take you back to 416(e).  I take it that you don't contest that for purposes of deciding that this -- which stepchildren get benefits and which grandchildren get benefits, we are just looking to Federal law, that we don't look to State law on those questions; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  You know, I'm looking at some of these, the grandchildren one for example.  It says the person who is the grandchild, but only if, blah, blah, blah.  It seems to have just sort of an understanding of what a grandchild is.  In other words, it's not really defining a grandchild here; it's limiting a class of grandchildren with a preexisting understanding of what a grandchild is.

And we know that Congress knew how to distinguish between the two because Congress distinguished between the two in this very act in the dependency provisions.  It talks about the legitimate child of such individual.  Well, here it didn't add that word.  It just said ""the child"".   Elena Kagan  Are there any other statutes that you can point to around this time which support the notion that when people said ""child"" they meant child within a legal marriage?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry, you can't point to anything because it's so clear?   Elena Kagan  Well, I suppose the question that is argued at the very least is getting us into a situation where we should interpret the statute the government's way because of constitutional avoidance concerns.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Rothfeld, I'm curious why you didn't argue a different theory which is that (e) refers to all biological children whether in marriage or outside of marriage and the (h) is set up for cases in which biological status is contested.  I mean, what would you think of that theory?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why didn't you argue it?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Rothfeld, why can't one just say, well, first sentence, whose child?  Look to State law.  Second sentence, when State law treats other people as children, you should treat them as other -- as children, too.  So the two sentences can cohere fine.  For children, look to State law, and also look to State law to see who they treat just like children.   Elena Kagan  Well, why not?   Elena Kagan  Well, that's exactly right, Mr. Rothfeld.  But you have two choices.  In the second sentence, you do have two groups, and one has to be compared to the other, which is children.  The question is, are children described by the first sentence of that, or are children described by the (e) section?  So you're just reading the first sentence out of the statute and saying that the second sentence totally subsumes the first sentence and we have to go back to (e).  But the first sentence exists.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you say no, it really, you know, it includes some kinds of decisions and not other kinds of decisions and the effect of that is that it's really a switch as to which court you get to take the action to, which is a very counterintuitive way to read this language.  So I guess I'm asking you: Where do you find the definition of the term of art?  And I think what your answer is going to be is this notion the board shall decide the issue of discrimination and the applicable action; is that correct.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Harrington, would you agree that this is a remarkably strange way of Congress trying to accomplish this objective?  I mean, if Congress were really saying we don't want procedural determinations to go to the district court, that's a very easy thing to say.  Congress does not need to send you -- you know, involve six different cross -- references and unnatural reading of statutory language.  And, you know, in the end, your argument just is based on this notion that Congress used the word decide rather than dispose of in this single provision.  The argument would completely collapse if that were not the case.  It just seems like if Congress wanted what you say it wanted, Congress would not have done it in this extremely complicated and backhanded way.   Elena Kagan  But you're not -- the Federal circuit didn't exist at the time that these statutes were written, so what -- you know, really, it would have been taken to the various courts of appeals, and you wouldn't have gotten that uniformity anyway.   Elena Kagan  Right, but Justice Sotomayor is right, that when you define “ judicially reviewable action ” in your way, then 7702(e)(1)(B) becomes nonsensical and you have to save it by inserting additional language, by saying, you know, “ and other ” -- “ and other kinds of action ”.   Elena Kagan  Well, it wouldn't make sense, but it's what the language would command if “ judicially reviewable action ” means what you say “ judicially reviewable means ”.   ",11-184X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Srinivasan, what you say has a good deal to recommend it, and it's basically, you know, why should we read the Tucker Act to reverse everything that we know about sovereign immunity, but it's really hard to get that from the text of this -- the Tucker Act.  In fact -- I mean, I guess my question is: Do you have any textual argument for the result that you are asking us to reach?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's not really a textual argument.  That's an argument about how we've sensibly limited the reach of the Tucker Act.  But the Tucker Act does seem to include what your friend there says it includes--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --against any statute.  Not any statute except the ones with remedial provisions, but just any statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Srinivasan--   Elena Kagan  --How specific does the other statute have to be?  Suppose there were another statute that just said any party can bring suits to enforce any rights against any persons under this statute.  Would you be making the same argument?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  If that's all the statute says.  It just says any party can bring suit to enforce rights under this statute.  So there is nor a lot of hoopla and a lot of detail about a remedial scheme.  Would you still say that this controls over the Tucker Act?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How about if a statute has no remedial provision at all; it just lists a set of legal obligations, but it is a generally applicable statute, it doesn't concern only the United States?  Would your argument still apply that the Tucker Act has no force?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So then your argument really isn't about another statute having a remedial scheme.  In the briefs, you present it as another statute has a remedial scheme, of course you should look to that more particular remedial scheme.  But you would take the argument and say, even if the other statute doesn't have a remedial scheme, we don't look to the Tucker Act; we just think of the Tucker Act as having a limitation that is not in the Tucker Act's test -- text in order to make the Tucker Act consistent with everything we thought we knew about principles of sovereign immunity?   ",11-192X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Jacobs--   Elena Kagan  --the -- the import of the government's argument is that if your interpretation governed, we would be facing, really, a quite massive change in the law of sovereign immunity as we've known it until this time.  So I will give you an -- Congress decides to pass a statute, and the statute has a cause of action in it.  And the drafters say to each other, do we have to say that the government retains sovereign immunity?  And everybody says, no, the rules are that if we say nothing at all, the government does retain sovereign immunity.  Now, under your world, the next time Congress passes such a statute and that question comes up, you would say, oh, we have to say that the government waives -- retains its sovereign immunity, because if we don't say that, somebody's going to bring an action under the Tucker Act.  So for every statute, both the ones that have been written under the old rules and the new ones to come, we have completely flipped the presumption.  Now, Congress is going to have to say when it wants to retain sovereign immunity, and if it doesn't -- if it doesn't, the Tucker Act applies, and you get to be in court.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't think that quite answers the question.  That's a -- that's a question about what FCRA means and whether under any standard, whether the fairly arguable standard or the express standard, you should win.  And that's a different question.  The question is what standard are we going to hold you to.  Are we going to say, all you need to show is that it's fairly arguable, or are we going to say, no, unless there's an express statement that the government has waived its sovereign immunity, the government retains it?  And as to that, you're asking us to flip the presumption from now on.   Elena Kagan  But Mr. Jacobs, you are trying to evade a certain kind of limitation.  The limitation that you are trying to evade is the rule that waivers of sovereign immunity have to be expressed.  And that's the rule you are trying to evade by going under the Tucker Act.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But then you wouldn't need to go under the Tucker Act.  The difference between going under the Tucker Act and going under the statute is the difference between, you know, what -- what standard is a court going to hold you to, to decide whether there has been a waiver of sovereign immunity.

0,"Elena Kagan  What would you point out in the majority opinion below that suggests that they did an analysis that didn't look at the error and its possible prejudicial effect?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Brindley, I think one difficulty -- and this is really repeating Justice Alito's question, but it seems that you are parsing things pretty closely.  If I ask the question whether an error altered the verdict, it seems to me I am asking pretty much the same question as whether without that verdict the -- whether without that error, the verdict would be the same.  That seems like just two ways of saying the same thing.  Now, if what you're saying is put aside that formulation, there are lots of courts that are doing something wrong, which is that they are not looking at the error and its possible prejudicial effect at all, then I understand the argument; but then I ask the question, well, is that what this court did?   ",11-199X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Yang, that does raise the question that I think most separates you and Mr. Brindley, and it's the question that Justice Alito suggested.  So let me give you a hypothetical.  Let's say that this jury was not out for eight hours, but was out for eight days.  And on the seventh day a note came from the jury, and the note said: We really think that these tape recordings are extremely important, but we're -- we're having a dispute about how important they are, and we would like to listen to them again.  And they do that, and then they come back with this compromise verdict.  Now, what you're suggesting is that we cannot look at any of that.  Essentially, the best proof that's available to us about whether the error in fact affected this jury's decision, you would have a court close its eyes to.  And I guess -- why would that be?   Elena Kagan  So let me make sure I understand what you are saying to me.  You are saying to me: No, we didn't mean to say that that was irrelevant; we just mean to say that an appellate court should be cautious about it and look at that kind of evidence in the -- in light of everything else that happened at the trial.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you just told me it wasn't, Mr. Yang.  Because -- because I think that the reason why this jury versus a reasonable jury is important is whether you are going to take into account what you know about what this jury did: How long it stayed out, what notes it wrote to the court, what eventual verdict it reached.  And you just suggested to me that that was fair game to consider in this analysis, although one should be cautious about doing it.   Elena Kagan  Well, a rational jury is not the jury that I said stayed out for 8 days and sent back a note on the seventh day.  That's this jury.   Elena Kagan  That's starting to look, Mr. Yang, very much like a directed verdict for the government on the part of the judge.  Because you are so abstracting it from this case and this jury and what this jury's reactions to everything that happened was that, you know, why not just go to the directed verdict?   Elena Kagan  You do have a jury -- Excuse me.  You do have a jury verdict, but you are giving us a formulation of the test that essentially pretends that the jury is not there, and that we know nothing about how it reacted to various things.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But critical to the Court's view in that case was that the -- the defendant could not have contested that element.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And you would need--   Elena Kagan  --Can I ask you a different question, Mr. Yang, which is, you know, this difference in the formulation of the test -- which I find it hard to wrap my mind around, but and -- it strikes me that there's two different ways of saying the same thing.  But I'm told that there's a fair bit of scholarship out there which suggests that courts that use one formulation tend to come out one way, and courts that use the other formulation tend to come out the other way.  And I'm just wondering what your view of that is, that somehow, one formulation seems to put the emphasis on the entire case.  Whereas the other formulation seems to put the emphasis on only the government's evidence, and that that makes a difference in the end.   INTERRUPTING ",11-199X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Goldstein, doesn't--   Elena Kagan  Mr. Stewart, there is this other regulation which is I guess in the coverage section, 779.241, which says that if an employee performs any work that in a practical sense is an essential part of consummating the sale of the goods, he will be considered to be selling the goods.  So I guess this question is a two-part question.  Do you agree that that regulation does cover the -- these detailers?  And the second part is, if you do, you know, how does it work that we should understand sale one way for purposes of coverage and another way for purposes of exemption?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that seems a little bit blind to the way the industry actually works.  The way this industry actually works is the real work is done by the detailer getting the doctor to say, yeah, I'm going to start prescribing this where it's medically appropriate.  The actual sales from the company to the pharmacy just follows from however successful the detailer is.   ",11-204X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, that might be one thing that they are concerned about, but it may not be the only thing.  I mean, if you look at these regulations, it seems as though what they are trying to do is draw a distinction between people who actually consummate transactions, transactional people, and people who are pitchmen.  And what the Department of Labor here is saying is detailers are people who make pitches; they are not people who consummate the transactions.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Why isn't that possible?  I mean, your brief seems to suggest that in every industry there needs to be some group of people who would be classified as outside salesmen, and that's not necessarily the case.  There may be some industries, and here it's a result of regulation, or it may be because of other business practices, where there just isn't anybody who's an outside salesman.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Clement, I thought that in 2004 there were two proposals, really, and one was the proposal that was changed and the other was the proposal to get rid of this promotional stuff and to allow people who promoted products to qualify as outside salesmen, and the agency specifically rejected that suggestion.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Clement--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  You've suggested--   Elena Kagan  --I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, I guess I'm not sure I understand what you just said.  If -- forget the transfer of title business, but if it's just -- we're requiring a transaction here.  And we're drawing a line between people who do transactions and people who just advertise or make pitches or whatever you want to do it.  That's perfectly consistent with the statute, isn't it?  I mean, you can argue about is it the only possible reading; you can even argue about whether it's the best possible reading.  But it's surely a -- a possible reading.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I suppose that that's a question.  For them, I read their amicus briefs to sort of suggest two things.  Sometimes they just talk about transactions, and sometimes they talk about transfer of title.   Elena Kagan  Well, I think that they would say that it doesn't make any difference, because they've never really seen a person who makes transactions without transferring title.  So I think that--   Elena Kagan  --But, Mr. Clement, this isn't a change.  You've referred to it as a change in a lot of ways -- in a lot of times, but what we have here is an agency that, for some number of years, thought that this was not the most urgent problem on their plate.  Indeed, one would think this is a pretty peculiar Department of Labor if they thought that this was the most urgent problem on their plate.  So they didn't enforce it.  But now the question has come up, and they say we'll look to our regulations.  This falls on one side of the regulation.  Now, you've been given a gift for all these years is one way of looking at it, because -- because you were not their most urgent problem, and so they didn't enforce their own regulations against you.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But don't you think that the way this works -- I mean, the way we should all hope it works is that the detailer comes in, the detailer provides information, the doctor says, that's very interesting, I want to think about it, I'm going to think about it.  Then the doctor reads some medical journals; then maybe the doctor goes to a convention and talks to other doctors about the product.  I mean, that's what you would hope that a doctor would do before a doctor decided, I'm going to start prescribing this medicine.  And the detail work is a part of that, but so are many things before the doctor actually decides to do something.   INTERRUPTING ",11-204X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, on the standing point, I mean, does the -- the distinction that you're setting up between acquisition of land and use of land -- this goes back to Justice Scalia's question -- that strikes me as artificial, that the question of when land is acquired is all tied up with the question of what use is going to be made of it.  The government doesn't acquire this land with no object in mind.  It thinks about how the land is going to be used.  So that, in the end, this really is a land use statute, isn't it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And the statute as well thinks of this as a -- is a statute that's designed to promote economic development, which is dependent on some understanding of how the land is actually going to be used by the tribes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Millett, it also says: ""Under this section"".   Elena Kagan  And the section describes the complaint.  It says:  ""The complainant shall set forth with particularity the nature of the right, title, or interest which the plaintiff claims. ""  So the type of suit that this section has in mind is a suit in which the plaintiff claims a right, title or interest.  And the language that you read, ""under this section"", well, that's what this section is about, a suit in which a plaintiff claims the right, title or interest.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but -- but in saying that you have just broadened, or arguably you have.  If -- if you think that the quiet title action is really about the narrower set of cases, which is when a person himself claims title, how can you get from that to say that there is an express or an implied refusal of -- of this kind of claim?   INTERRUPTING ",11-246X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Nelson, putting that question aside of whether this is or isn't a quiet title action, there's another question, which is whether sovereign immunity can come into effect after a suit has been filed.  It seems to me a hard question and one that has not been briefed by either party particularly.  So I just ask you, is there case -- are there any cases that you can point to that suggest that sovereign immunity cannot come into effect after a suit has been filed?  Because what the government says is, you know, circumstances change, conditions change on the ground, sovereign immunity can pop up where it didn't exist before.  Is there any precedent that you have to negate that?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Nelson--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Nelson, could I understand the scope of your argument?  Because I had understood -- let's take the timing question aside for a minute.  Let's -- let's assume that you had filed this suit after title had transferred.  I had understood that your argument was, yes, you should be allowed to do that because, even though this was filed after title had transferred, yours is just not a quiet title action, and it's not a quiet title action because you're not seeking title yourself.  Isn't that the question?  Isn't that your argument?   Elena Kagan  So your argument really has nothing to do with the question of timing.  Your argument would be the same even if title had transferred prior to your filing your lawsuit.   Elena Kagan  Well, as I understood your brief, 49 pages of it were about one thing, and there's one footnote that's about something else.  In other words, all of your brief is basically saying: Ours is just not a quiet title action, and so we should be allowed to proceed irrespective of when the government acquires title.  And then you have this little additional argument which says: By the way, we started this lawsuit before the government had title anyway.  So, I mean, the briefing in this case is all about what you now say is your weakest point.   Elena Kagan  I think--   Elena Kagan  --I suppose the question, Mr. Nelson, though, is whether you can provide us with a reason why Congress would have wanted what you call quiet title suits -- and I agree that your definition is the traditional definition; when somebody -- when the plaintiff is a -- is himself asserting a right or interest -- why those suits should be barred, but your suit involving a third party should not be barred.  What could possibly be the reason to distinguish between those two sets of cases?  Now, you might just say, I don't have to give you a reason, this is what the result of the statute says.  But if I say, just try to provide me with a reason why Congress would have wanted that distinction, what would you say?   ",11-246X
1,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Bishop, as -- as Justice Ginsburg said, that question was not decided below, and in the context of this case, which, of course, was very different when it was briefed, Mr. Fisher spent a grand total of 2 pages, and rightly so.  It wasn't -- it was -- it was not the main issue in the case then.  So would we really be doing something, you know, a good practice to decide this issue without really any briefing on it and without a decision below?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that isn't really quite fair.  It is 2 pages because it wasn't decided below and because -- and because the -- the question the -- in the case was very different, with a different regulation.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Bishop, could I -- I'm sorry that I don't understand this well enough yet, but can I understand what's still at stake for you in -- in the case?  Put aside the question of whether the new rule is valid or not, all right?  And what -- what do you have riding on whether the Ninth Circuit's decision is correct at this point?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Which remedies are you worried about?   Elena Kagan  Is what you said true also of the remediation piece of this?  You said that at this point even if we understand this as a change in the law, the Plaintiffs would not be entitled to fines.  Would they also not be entitled to any kind of remediation?

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Schwartz--   Elena Kagan  --suppose an employee is fired and he has a variety of different kinds of claims, constitutional and statutory.  What would you think happens then?  Does he bring the constitutional claims in one court but the statutory claims in another court -- excuse me -- in the -- in the commission?   Elena Kagan  Well, that seems just as bad.  In other words, that then, you -- it's not inefficient necessarily, but your scheme would force the employee to choose between her constitutional claims and her statutory claims.   Elena Kagan  Why -- why would we do that?   Elena Kagan  You suggested that it's a situation that doesn't often arise and I guess that puzzles me.  Why wouldn't it often arise?   Elena Kagan  Well, why wouldn't the dividing line be -- and I think that this is consistent with your argument -- the dividing line should be where the MSPB itself could decide the claim.   Elena Kagan  If the MSPB can decide the claim, then it goes to the MSPB.  If the MSPB can't decide the claim, I think is what you are saying, saying then this has to go to the district court.   Elena Kagan  And you're saying that the MSPB has said that, although it can decide, can decide, cases where he says, you know, my supervisor fired me for a discriminatory reason, that that's within the scope of the MSPB's authority, a claim like this, which is that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional full stop, is not within the scope of the MSPB's authority.  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  And in your original briefs, Mr. Schwartz, you suggested that if the MSPB can't hear a claim, neither can the Federal Circuit.  And as I understood the government's brief, the government comes back and said that's not the case.  Even when the MSPB can't hear a claim, the Federal Circuit could hear it.  Now, then there is a question of if there is a necessity for a record how does the record get developed.  But do you now concede that the Federal Circuit could hear the claim as a matter, you know, at the first level?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, isn't your basic answer to Justice Breyer, I mean correct me if I'm wrong, you think that the problem is that there is no record that the Federal Circuit can use to evaluate this constitutional claim.   ",11-45XX
0,"Elena Kagan  You could just ask the MSPB, Mr. Feigin.  If you bring the claim to the MSPB and then the MSPB says, no, we have no authority to adjudicate this claim, then you know that you're in a world in which the MSPB doesn't have authority, so that you can go to the district court.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but the CSRA is presuming that the MSPB actually can decide something.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, could you help me with something, because I agree with you, Thunder Basin is a very strong case for you, but McNary is a very strong case for Mr. Schwartz.  And I read those two opinions and frankly I have a tough time reconciling them.  So could you tell me how you do?   Elena Kagan  Yes, I imagine.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, its very different because the magistrate can come back to the district court judge and say, we have a tough one, Your Honor, why don't you decide it?  I mean, here you're stipulating that the board has no power to decide this question.  Call it jurisdiction; call it something else.  The board cannot decide the question, but the board is going to now become the arbiter of discovery disputes?  The fact finder?  I mean, weird is a good word for it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you think the MSPB should find facts with regard to this claim?   Elena Kagan  I would think, Mr. Feigin, it would depend on how it's litigated.  But in a case in which there is some fact finding to be made, would the MSPB have authority to find facts?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Feigin, they might well be the same claim, but if the MSPB can decide the one and cannot decide the other, that's a relevant distinction.  Now, you might be right in what you said.  Well, maybe one answer is if the MSPB can decide both.  But as long as the MSPB can decide the one or the other, it seems, great, I mean, it seems like a sensible dividing line.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's weird in another way, isn't it, Mr. Feigin?  Because, can we really imagine in the real world the MSPB deciding that the Selective Service Act is unconstitutional?  I mean, what do they know about that question?   Elena Kagan  Well, but this is a question, and -- and you can -- I take the point that I'm just talking about this case.  But this is a question about whether women should have to register for the draft in the same way as men should.  That goes to defense policy.  It goes to equal protection law.  It doesn't seem to have anything to do with -- with workplace issues of the kinds that the MSPB is expert on.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Feigin, could I go back to the Chief Justice's question about what actually would happen in the MSPB.  Presumably in this case, what the plaintiffs seek to do is to develop an extensive factual record showing how much has changed in the military in terms of the -- the -- the role that women play in the military.  And that it's almost impossible to litigate this kind of claim without having such a record.  That's the entire basis for -- for arguing that Rostker is outmoded, given current military operations.

1,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Brenan, can I ask you what you mean by a plain statement?  Because you've said a couple of times a plain statement to the contrary.  Justice Sotomayor and Justice Alito have given you hypotheticals, very different from this case, but hypotheticals, where there is, I think, a strong inference that there was no adjudication of the particular Federal claim alleged.  You said that's not a plain statement, even though it seems as though there is a strong inference.  So what would be a plain statement?   Elena Kagan  Yes, I don't know why they would say that either.  Well, by the way, we're not adjudicating this, you know.  So if that's your test, your test is an irrebuttable presumption.   Elena Kagan  Could I go back, Ms. Brenan, to your basic theory, because I guess I'm not sure I understand what you're arguing now.  In your brief, you talked about focusing on the error.  So if evidence was admitted, you would say it doesn't matter that there were three different theories for why the admission of evidence was wrong; you should just look at the fact that we're talking about the admission of evidence.  Now, is that what you're arguing, or are you also saying what the states say in their amicus brief, that even if, you know, one claim is about the admission of evidence, and one claim is about ineffective assistance of counsel, you would still apply the same rule?   Elena Kagan  Well, why does your theory make any sense?  I mean, we're supposed to be interpreting a statute here that says whether the claim was adjudicated on the merits.  Usually when we speak of claims, we speak of legal grounds for relief.

California has made it completely clear in other cases post Cleveland that it thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment.

It thinks it's applying the Sixth Amendment, and it's reaching a Constitutional judgment, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You're quite right, it does not adopt the consensus standard.  It specifically rejects the consensus standard, but it's entitled to do that.  As a state court, with no Supreme Court decision that it has to follow, it can say, we have a different view of the Sixth Amendment.  I'm just repeating what Justice Alito here said.

So suppose that there's a government program, and it's to purchase airplanes.  And it's -- the authorization language says this is subject to appropriations, in the same way that this language does.  And the government, under this program, enters into 10 contracts of a million dollars each to buy 10 airplanes.  But then it turns out that Congress appropriates only $9 million, not $10 million.  So my question is: Now there are 10 contractors and -- but there's a shortfall of a million dollars--   Elena Kagan  --do those contractors have contractual rights under Ferris?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  So the appropriation has been made.  It's a $9 million appropriation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So -- so either one of these airplane manufacturers is going to not have what he contracted for, or all of them are not going to have what they contracted for, because everybody is going to -- their contract is going to be sliced.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  My understanding, Mr. Freeman, is that that is what Ferris said, was that Ferris said in that situation where it turns out that there's a shortfall but where there are contractual commitments, that -- that the government is bound to live up to those contractual commitments.  And if there's a shortfall, then it comes out of the Judgment Fund.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but that's partly why I asked you my hypothetical, Mr. Freeman, because I sort of wanted to see whether you would distinguish the hypothetical on that basis--   Elena Kagan  --but you didn't.  You said no, it doesn't really matter.  Even if the government is not obligated to enter into contracts, if the government has entered into too many, too bad; we can't make those additional appropriations.   Elena Kagan  But that runs you right into Ferris.  Then you're saying that there's no difference between the standard Ferris-type appropriation, which is just an amount of money, and this kind of appropriation, which is up to or not to exceed that amount of money.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess what I don't understand about the government's argument, Mr. Freeman, is exactly what the contractual rights of the tribes become.  I mean, as I -- this is supposed to be a contract, and we've held that it's a contract, and usually contracting parties have rights to something.   Elena Kagan  So what do they have a right to in your view?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That was -- that was a straightforward question.  [Laughter]   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but what do they have a right to with respect to these additional overhead costs?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What does each individual tribe have a right to?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you think they do have a right to a pro rata share?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  In other words, the Secretary could not say, oh, you know, these tribes have been doing a better job, so we'll give to them; or these tribes need it more, so we'll give it to them.  You think that there's a contractual right to a pro rata share.   INTERRUPTING ",11-551X

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Ortiz, suppose I agree with your standard, but I just can't find on the record as it has been presented in this Court any evidence that Davis actually served as Vance's supervisor.  What -- I mean, what's your best -- so if that's true, I would be tempted to actually just decide the thing rather than to remand it.  So as against that approach, what is your best evidence that there was a supervisory relationship under your standard here?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, is that the case?  Is there evidence that you did not present because the Seventh Circuit applied a different standard?   Elena Kagan  Could I ask you how the Seventh Circuit test works in operation?  We're in a university setting here, so let me give you a university hypo.  There's a professor, and the professor has a secretary.  And the professor subjects that secretary to living hell, complete hostile work environment on the basis of sex, all right?  But the professor has absolutely no authority to fire the secretary.  What would the Seventh Circuit say about that situation?   Sri Srinivasan  That if there's no authority over -- to -- to direct annual employment actions, then--   Elena Kagan  No, no, the secretary is fired by the head of secretarial services.  Professors don't have the ability to fire secretaries; but, professors do have the ability to make secretarial lives living hells.  So what does the Seventh Circuit say about that?   Sri Srinivasan  --The professor would not qualify as a supervisor for purposes of Ellerth-Faragher framework.   Elena Kagan  Under the Seventh Circuit test.   Sri Srinivasan  And so you'd look at it as a -- you'd look at the professor as a coworker, and you'd apply the same standards that applied to harassment conducted by the coworker.   Elena Kagan  Even though, of course, it's actually more difficult for the secretary to complain about the professor than it would be for the secretary to complain about the head of secretarial services.   Sri Srinivasan  Yes.  And I think that's a useful frame of reference that I was trying to articulate earlier, which is that we can envision the cases as falling on a spectrum between ability to complain when the harassment is perpetrated by a coworker on the one hand, and ability to complain when harassment is perpetrated by a supervisor with tangible employment authority--   Elena Kagan  And Mr. Srinivasan, if I can just continue on about this, because I just don't even understand the Seventh Circuit test.  Would the Seventh Circuit test also say that -- that that person is not a supervisor even if the professor evaluates the secretary on a yearly basis?   Sri Srinivasan  --The Seventh Circuit would say that as far as we can tell.  They don't appear to have a proviso for circumstances in which the harasser has a role in determining tangible employment actions, because that is one thing that the EEOC guidance takes account of.  It's that -- not just that somebody counts as a supervisor when they themselves undertake tangible employment action, but if they have a substantial role in making recommendations that in turn trigger tangible employment actions, the EEOC would take the position that that qualifies.  Now, that's not an issue in this case, but that's--   ",11-556X

But you're not talking about purpose of either the homeowner or the manufacturer of the boat.  You're just saying what does this -- or what does this thing, this floating home, do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Right.  So you are really talking about a function test.  And you are using strange words, because they come out of our opinions -- kind of not your fault.  But you're really saying that what should apply here is a function test.  We are looking at this floating home.  What does it do?  Is it just a thing that sits, or is it a thing that transports things over water.  Isn't that your test?   Elena Kagan  Well, how do we know that.   Elena Kagan  How do we know that, Mr. Fisher?  I mean, maybe these floating homes are just a poor man's houseboat, right?  But the point of getting a floating home is actually to have a home that you can hook up to a boat and move from place to place, and so you don't have to, you know, have the motor running all the time or have the capacity to move it all the time, but when you want to move it on water and when you want to move your possessions on water, you have the capacity to do so.   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Gannon, you think that even at the moment that the thing is being transported, and let's say that the thing has, you know, various furniture and things on it, you think even at that moment under section 3, it's not a -- it might not be a vessel?

Elena Kagan  Well, suppose, Mr. Frederick, this.  Suppose we had a trial on the question of whether these floating homes or this floating home was a vessel, and we found out that actually 99 percent of people who buy floating homes move it exactly once.  They purchase the floating home and then they move it to the place where they want the home to be, and then it sits there.  And this was just a clear evidence that, you know, except if there's a hurricane or a tornado, people do not move floating homes.  They buy it, they move it to where they want to live, and then it sits.  In that case, do you think the thing is a vessel?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's a statute--   Elena Kagan  --You are reading the statute -- you are reading the statute as if it says something can be transported over water.  But the statute doesn't say that.  It says something can be used or capable of being used as a means of transportation on water.  So that -- that the question is whether this thing is transporting other things over water, and whether that's its function; and in my hypothetical it's not its function.  Its function is to serve as a house.  That house happens to be on water but it's just a house.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Frederick, if that is the case, then your test really comes down to how securely is something fastened.  I mean, you have to deal with Evansville's wharf boat and Cage's dry dock, and you have to deal with all these floating casinos and restaurants.  And you're saying that in all these cases we are supposed to look to is it a rope or is it a cable, how many cables, how quickly can it be disengaged, and that that's going to end up being the test that you would have us adopt which is how easy it is to get out of the port.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That really does become a jury question -- a question of fact for everything, right?

0,"Elena Kagan  But your argument, of course, isn't limited to that.  It goes beyond that situation?   Elena Kagan  But what -- what you're objecting to, to the extent that you're not objecting to the entire system of collective bargaining, you're objecting -- you're saying an individual employee can say I don't feel like supporting a union that makes a certain kind of argument about wages or about benefits.  So, just to carry on with Justice Scalia's example, the subject matter is the exact same in the two contexts, whether it's an individual employee or whether it's a union, and in both contexts, the -- the ultimate sanction is the same, right?  Somebody grouses about his pay too much, he could get fired.  Somebody refuses to support a union that is negotiating about pay, he can lose his job.  So it's -- it's really identical across the two situations.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Same subject matter, same sanction.  What's the difference?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you're not objecting, I think, to the union as a whole.  What you're objecting to is an individual employee having to support that activity.  The scale is no different.  It's an individual employee.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's exactly what the individual employee in Justice Scalia's hypothetical is arguing for.  He wants wage rates to be changed across the board.  He knows they're not going to be changed just for him.  He wants higher wage rates.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Messenger, I'm not sure that Justice Scalia's answer satisfies his own question.  [Laughter]   Elena Kagan  Because here's the thing: That in the workplace we've given the government a very wide degree of latitude and there's much that the government can do.  It can fire people.  It can demote people for things that they say in the workplace, not for things that they say as a citizen, but for things that they say in the workplace.  That's the fundamental lesson of Garcetti and of many, many others of our cases.  So you're saying, well, the government can punish somebody for saying something, but the government in the exact same position cannot compel somebody to say something they disagree with.  And I want to know what's the basis for that distinction, which it seems to me is just as hard as -- as if you were answering under the petition clause.   Elena Kagan  Good, okay.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Messenger--   Elena Kagan  --So, Mr. Messenger, even on the compulsory fees, I mean, what strikes me is that this is -- I'm just going to use the word here, it is a radical argument.  It would radically restructure the way workplaces across this country are -- are run.  And let me just put it to you this way and ask if you agree with this -- with this statement.  Since 1948, since the Taft-Hartley Act, there has been a debate in every State across this country about whether to be a right-to-work State and people have disagreed.  Some States say yes, some States say no.  It raises considerable heat and passion and tension, as we recently saw in Wisconsin.  And -- but, you know, these are public policy choices that States make.  And is it fair to say that what you're suggesting here, your argument, is essentially to say that for 65 years, people have been debating the wrong question when they've been debating that, because, in fact, a right-to-work law is constitutionally compelled?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Messenger, do you doubt that these -- you said that there were no reliance interests, and -- and that's curious to me.  There must be thousands and thousands of contracts across the United States with fair share provisions.  Do you doubt that these were core central provisions in the making of these contracts?  That if these kinds of provisions were prohibited, the -- the agreements would look fundamentally different in many ways?   Elena Kagan  You think that the union would -- would not ask for anything, would not have different -- you know, would not ask for different mechanisms in order to support its own activity?  The unions go into these contracts with the understanding that this is what's going to enable them to at once satisfy their universal obligation to employees to fairly represent them and also, get the funds they need for administrative and other expenses.   Elena Kagan  So you think that if we just strike these provisions, in other words, the -- the contracts would have been negotiated in exactly the same way, nothing else would have changed?

Elena Kagan  If you assume that this statute covers and is regularly used to cover both sets of people, both people with these very minor offenses and people with much more major offenses--   Elena Kagan  --the at least apparent attractiveness of the Government's position is that they've tried to cure their overinclusiveness problem, and they have done it by sticking on -- and, you know, one can ask where this comes from in the statute--   Elena Kagan  --but they have done it by sticking on something that attempts to address their overinclusiveness problem, so that people who are really misdemeanants get classified as misdemeanants, and people who are really aggravated felons get classified that way.  And you have no similar cure for your underinclusiveness problem, so why shouldn't we go with their problem, which at least attempts to solve this problem?

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Shah, the Board may have been doing these inquiries, but I just don't understand the statutory argument, because the way the statute -- the way your own statutory argument runs is that if the conviction, the state conviction, was a conviction for possession with intent to distribute, then those are the elements of a Federal -- of a Federal felony.  And so the person -- and an aggravated felony.  So you say under the elements approach, this person has committed an aggravated felony.  And the statutory directive is that when a person has committed an aggravated felony, he is deportable, and there is no exercise of discretion that can come into play.  And so your whole back-end process, which says, oh, well, maybe not, maybe he's not automatically deportable, it doesn't come from the statute, and it seems to run into the statutory language which says an aggravated felon must be deported, the end.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's what the statute says, and that's what your own statutory analysis says.   Elena Kagan  No, I'll just read you, Mr. Shah, this sentence from your brief, and I could read you a thousand of these in your brief:  ""Because Petitioner's Georgia conviction necessarily established that he knowingly possessed marijuana with the specific intent to distribute it, that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony. ""  Well, if that conviction constitutes an aggravated felony, he has to be deported and there is no exercise of discretion that this statute allows.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, now you've just put in words into your brief.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --and -- and really, truly you say this 10 or 15 times.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Shah, I think the problem with your main argument is that it leads you to a result that you don't want to accept, because your main argument is all we've done in our past cases, and I can argue with this, but your argument is all we've done is compare the elements.  But if all we do is compare the elements, then we don't get to your discretionary scheme in which we also admit evidence of the case-specific nature of the offense.  I mean, so your arguments all go towards a very purist solution.  And then you say, oh, no, that's a crazy solution.  It's a crazy solution because we would wind up saying that misdemeanants like this person, like people who are actually convicted under (b)(4) who are clearly misdemeanants, would wind up as aggravated felons and -- and must be deported.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't think we really have an agreement--   Elena Kagan  --because it seems to me that Carachuri actually says we don't just look to elements.  But if we were just to look to elements in the way you're arguing for, we wouldn't get the result that you're arguing for.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't think that that is quite right, Mr. Shah, because if you read this statute, what it most looks like is that Congress is simply classifying two different kinds of conduct.  Congress has the -- the social sharing conduct, and that's in one section.  And the everything else, the more dangerous conduct, is in another section.  And so it's not something where it's like, oh, you're trying to get them to negate a specific -- a point.  Congress has created two separate sections, two -- and one is a felony, and one is a misdemeanor.  And that's the real way to understand this statute.  And then, the categorical approach suggests, well, in that case, we accept the underinclusion rather than the overinclusion.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand, Mr. Shah.  That seems just a question of labeling to me.  I mean, why should we -- why should we accept that labeling rather than, look, what Congress did here was to say that certain kinds of offenses are felonies deserving of grave punishment, and other kinds of offenses are misdemeanors deserving of less than a year in prison, and we see those categories of conduct differently.  And if you are saying that if Congress had said two separate offenses, then the categorical approach means that Mr. Goldstein's client wins, I guess I just don't get what in this statute suggests something different for that.

And you are essentially asking for the district court in the State of Texas to try to predict what they are going to do and to mimic what they are going to do.  And that's why Justice Alito suggests, well, look, if we said that only the district court in D.C. and the Attorney General should do this, let's wait until they do it and go from there.   Elena Kagan  But you are not taking into account the fact that, as Justice Sotomayor said, section 5 itself operates as an injunction.  And it's an injunction against the use of an unprecleared plan.   Elena Kagan  But haven't we also said that, with respect to section 2 and constitutional violations, that those allegations would be unripe in the -- prior to the district court or the Attorney General clearing a plan?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Section 5 says somebody has to clear it before it can go into effect.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Nobody said the opposite.

But it's different in two other respects from a standard preliminary injunction context as well.

And you said, well, they can protect themselves by contract.

I mean, assume that you have these ten circuit courts all going in the way that the Chief Justice said, and then one court came along and said, you know, we think that they -- in an AEDPA context, a habeas consideration of a state conviction -- we think that this is all wrong, and, in fact, the law is exactly the opposite of what ten circuits have held.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Fisher, it would seem to me that this case presents a kind of threshold question.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Estrada, doesn't Justice Ginsburg's question actually point out that the -- the law that both the district court and the circuit court used in this case was actually quite favorable to you.  Unlike some courts, both the district court and the circuit court said that the plaintiffs needed to show that there was a class-wide measurement of damages.  And then in addition, both courts said really, it was -- the burden was on the plaintiffs to demonstrate that that class-wide measure of damages existed.  Now, I understand that you have problems with the way in which the plaintiffs met that burden.  You say that they didn't meet that burden.  But it seems to me that the legal standard that was used was exactly the legal standard that you wanted, that the plaintiffs had to come in and show by a preponderance that they had a class-wide way to measure damages in this case.   Elena Kagan  Well, here's what the district court said.  ""The experts' opinions raise substantial issues of fact and credibility that we are required to resolve to decide the pending motion. ""  That is the motion for class certification.  ""Having rigorously analyzed the experts' reports, we conclude that the class has met its burden to demonstrate that the elements of antitrust impact is capable of proof at trial through evidence that is common to the class, and that there is a common methodology available to measure and quantify damages on a class-wide basis. ""  So that seems to me exactly what you say they should have done.  Now, you disagree with their ultimate determination, but not with the statement of the law.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr.--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Estrada, as -- as the case comes to the Court, I guess I wonder why any of this is relevant.  You mentioned earlier, you mentioned earlier that we reformulated the question presented in this case.  And we reformulated in a way which said that what we wanted to talk about was whether a district court at a class certification stage has to conduct a Daubert inquiry, in other words has to decide on the admissibility of expert testimony relating to class-wide damages.  And, you know, it would not be crazy to surmise that we reformulated the question because we wanted to present, we wanted to decide a legal question, rather than a question about who was right as to this particular expert's report and how strong it was.  And it turns out that as to that legal question, your clients waived their -- their argument that this was inadmissible evidence.  So -- so what do we do in that circumstance?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The district court, Mr. Estrada, clearly understood you to be making an argument about weight and not about admissibility.  And indeed the district court in open court -- and -- and it's in the transcript -- suggests that it's doing something different from holding a Daubert hearing, explains how it's different from holding a Daubert hearing, and both lawyers agree to that statement.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Estrada, it seems like a remarkable proposition, honestly, especially with a client like yours that is well lawyered.  It seems like a remarkable proposition that somebody -- a party can say, we have objections about the weight of this evidence.  We don't think -- we don't think it's a strong expert report, and that -- and that we -- and that the Court should then infer that there is an objection to admissibility of evidence as opposed, again, to the weight and strength of evidence.  I mean, surely a district court confronted with an argument about the weight and strength of evidence does not have to say: Oh, I better go hold a Daubert hearing to rule on admissibility even though nobody's asked me--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --to rule on admissibility.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Did you ever file a motion to strike the expert report?   ",11-864X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Barnett, it's always true, isn't it, that evidence that is inadequately probative is inadmissible?   Elena Kagan  It's always been true, right, if evidence is not--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --If that's the case.  I mean, but have we ever said that -- that without an objection somebody can say, look, we -- we argued about this evidence and that should be just good enough, even though we didn't -- we didn't make an objection to exclude it?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Barnett -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Then I will.  I am still in search of a legal question that anybody disagrees about here.  You know, I read before the district court statement of the standard, now all points of the circuit court statement of the standard, where the circuit court says,  ""The inquiry for a district court at the class certification stage is whether the plaintiffs have demonstrated. ""  --burden is on you --  ""by a preponderance of the evidence that they will be able to measure damages on a class-wide basis using common proof. ""  The parties both agree with that statement of the standard.  It seems to me that the parties also both agree, and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question, that if the Daubert question had not been waived, that if -- if Comcast had objected to the admissibility of this expert report, that indeed, the court would -- should have held a hearing on the admissibility of the expert report.  So this is a case where it seems to me that except for the question of how good the expert report is, none of the parties have any adversarial difference as to the appropriate legal standard.  And, you know, usually we decide cases based on disagreements about law, and here I can't find one.  Is there any?  Do you disagree with Mr. Estrada on any statement of the legal standard?

Now you have a theory that they all just read Judge Edwards and they came in and used ""individual"" but it seems actually that we know where individual came from in this statute.  The statute started out by saying person and then there was this moment where one Congressman said, I don't want this to apply to corporations, and the staff member said, I have a great idea to make sure it doesn't apply to corporations, let's change the word person to individual.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Dupree -- I'm sorry.  Please.   Elena Kagan  And, Mr. Dupree, even if you waived that point, if I understand it correctly, you did not waive the point that even with all attribution in the world, there still is no general jurisdiction over Daimler.  In other words, you could attribute all MBUSA's contacts and you still would not have general jurisdiction over Daimler; is that right?   Elena Kagan  So in that sense, it really doesn't depend on the attribution standard, all these hard questions of is it an alter ego test or is it an agency test and how does the Constitution relate to State law, because we could apply any test we wanted, and there still wouldn't be general jurisdiction over Daimler in California.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Dupree--   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kneedler, what do you think about this, that -- you know, as I've been looking through these cases, it seems to me that all these attribution issues and the conflict about attribution arises because courts generally have an improperly broad understanding of general jurisdiction and don't quite understand the distinction between general and specific jurisdiction.  If the courts -- if the Court here had understood that general jurisdiction applies when a company is essentially at home in a place, would any of these questions have arisen?

So it's bad practice, and I understand your, you know, idea about they didn't argue this, they didn't argue that.  But to assume something that's obviously a fallacy as your basis for a decision is not likely to lead you to a good outcome.   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Russell, they did talk about Daimler wasn't subject to general jurisdiction.  They didn't contest MBUSA's being subject to general jurisdiction, but they said Daimler isn't subject to general jurisdiction.  So, you know, they didn't make the precise argument that they should have made, but they basically put the question at issue: Is Daimler subject to general jurisdiction?  Answer: No.  Daimler is a German corporation.  If it were subject to general jurisdiction in California, so too it would be subject to general jurisdiction in every State in the United States, and all of that has got to be wrong.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Russell, how would you make the argument, and again with Justice Alito, sort of putting these waiver questions aside for a second, a German corporation incorporated in Germany, headquartered in Germany, 2.4 percent of its sales are in California.  How do you argue that it's subject to jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, not specific jurisdiction, general jurisdiction, which means over suits that have nothing to do with California or indeed, as here, over in the United States, have anything to do with anything that happened in the United States.

They don't -- there's no showing of that kind that has to be made in a parens patriae case.   Elena Kagan  But again, this clearly--   Elena Kagan  --But they don't have to show -- and this is clearly referring to a kind of Rule 23 inquiry, which they don't have to go through to do a parens patriae.

Here's our claim.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Curran, really, do you -- are you saying that as a matter of State law, that in this suit the attorney general has to make a proposal that -- that the plaintiff -- that -- that he can bring the suit on the grounds that the plaintiffs' claims involve common questions of law or fact and that that proposal has to be adjudicated by the Court?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But he does not have to show any common questions of law or fact in the typical way that we demand.  I mean, that's actually a very demanding showing that we have forced lawyers to make in the class action context.  All that the attorney general has to do is to stand up and say, I have a State interest in protecting my citizens and in deterring improper behavior and here is my substantive right.   Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand the bifurcation point.  It seems to me that what the attorney general is saying is he has a set of claims.  They're his claims on behalf of the -- the populace, but -- but to further State's own interests.  And there -- there's none of this Rule 23 kind of business about common questions of law or fact.  So it's not a question of, you know, one set of claims or another set of claims now or later.  He has a claim.  That's all he has.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And this is the main provision where they're trying to define what mass action means.  And I take your point that there are -- there's some slippage between this provision and the various provisions that it refers back to, because those provisions, we're talking about class actions and this one is talking about mass actions.  But this is the essential definition.  And this one seems to be pointing to a very different kind of suit, one in which there are 100 individual claims that -- that 100 people seek to have joined in which a court is going to make a determination about whether those 100 individual claims have questions of common law or fact.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's essentially what it says.  I mean, the only -- the only thing it doesn't say in what you just said is that it says persons instead of named plaintiffs.

Elena Kagan  And sometimes there are those bad actors, but probably more often it's just a function of there are just lots of people, and they, your clients and all of -- all of them want to be as close as possible to the site, and that that naturally leads to an interference with normal access.   Elena Kagan  But are you saying that you could not do an act that instead just says, look, it's a little bit too hard to figure out what and what does not disrupt peace and order, so we're just going to say 25 feet around a funeral, or 25 feet around any facility, that that's never permissible?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, for example, I was intrigued by one of the examples that you gave in your own brief, which you said slaughterhouses.  So, let's say, that there are animal rights activists, and this is easy to imagine, who try to interfere with access in and out of slaughterhouses.  And a State passes a regulation that says there's a ton of interference, it's preventing the operation of these facilities, employees can't get in, suppliers can't get in, slaughterhouses are leaving the State because of this problem, and so we're just going to set up a zone and let's call it 30 feet, because it's very hard to enforce anything else.  I guess my reaction to that hypothetical -- you -- you must have used it for me to say, oh, that's terrible.  But my reaction, my intuition was kind of what's wrong with that?  Just have everybody take a step back.  So what is wrong with that?   Elena Kagan  But let's go back to the slaughterhouse case.  I mean, there might be people who say it's really important to us to actually be able to face-to-face talk with the employees and tell them why they should get different jobs or why they should change their practices in various kinds of ways.  And, you know, there are some people who think signs and chants are great, but there are people who really want to make one-to-one contact with the truck drivers, with the employees, whoever.  But -- but you say, you know, we have to let whatever interference goes on, even if there's a record of -- of real obstruction, of real interference with the operation of the facility, in order to allow that to happen.  And I guess I think that that's -- that's pretty hard.   Elena Kagan  But isn't that more a function that they just have a private parking lot?

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, it's more than a few feet.  You know, 35 feet is a ways.  It's from this bench to the end of the court.  And if you imagine the Chief Justice as sort of where the door would be, it's most of the width of this courtroom as well.  It's -- it's pretty much this courtroom, kind of.  That's a lot of space.   Elena Kagan  How did you pick 35 feet?  Why 35?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that raises another question, Ms. Miller, because I assume that that's true because the crowds and the obstruction really are with respect to one facility at certain periods of time.  So Mr. Rienzi says, look, if it's at one facility, not all ten of them or whatever it is, and it's only for certain periods of time, not all day every day, you know, why not narrow it that way?   Elena Kagan  So why not?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And I would think, Ms. Miller, that if you tried to do a statute that distinguished between protestors and counselors, that would be content-based much more than this statute is.   Elena Kagan  I mean, but -- you know, which is not to say that this statute doesn't have its problems, in my view.  I mean, so I guess I'm a little bit hung up on why you need so much space.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Lechner, I know a great more than -- and that is very strong support for your view.  But why did Great Northern think that there was a difference between pre-1871 grants and post?   Elena Kagan  I guess I had thought if you were just dealing with this as a matter of first impression that the shift of Congress's policy was a shift about whether to give away, you know, huge swaths of land to the railroads, and that Congress indeed decided, Enough of this, we are not going to give these checkerboard grants of land to the railroad, because they are making a mint from this, and we would rather give it to homesteaders.  But there was -- I don't see any evidence that there was any shift in policy or any reason why there would be a shift in policy, as to what the rights of way were.  Whether they were easements or whether they were limited fees.   Elena Kagan  I guess, you know, again, if you were just looking at this as a matter of first impression, the language of Section 4 does not seem to me to be very indicative of anything.  You know, it says ""subject to the right-of-way"".  Subject to the right-of-way.  Whatever the right-of-way is.  Subject to the right-of-way if it's an easement.  Subject to the right-of-way if it's a limited fee.  Doesn't seem to pick one way or the other.   ",12-1173

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The patent here, Mr. Yang, which was, what, in the mid-1970s did not reserve anything.  The government just made an uncritical grant to the grant family?   Elena Kagan  Well, I'm just suggesting that after Great Northern and then you're given this patent, which is unequivocal and does not reserve anything, why anybody would think that they haven't gotten the whole ball of wax is a mystery.   Elena Kagan  It seems to me a fair reading of the history here, Mr. Yang, is that it really didn't occur to the government until very recently that these rights of way had value as anything other than railroad tracks, and indeed that the government was anxiously trying to give these things away because it thought that these spaghetti strips of land, it's of no use to the government, here, take them, get them off our hands.  And having done that for many, many, many decades, the government faces a problem when it turns around and says, you know what, we forgot, there are bike paths.

1,"Elena Kagan  Is the idea, Mr. Stewart, that the States that are required to do more are the States that haven't done much already?   Elena Kagan  Can I ask a question?   Elena Kagan  Can I ask a question?  Following up on Justice Scalia about the statutory language and how you read it, I think, you know, most people, everybody, thinks that it's better to regulate with attention to costs than to regulate without attention to costs.  We have this, our Trucking Association decision where we said, well, notwithstanding that everybody agrees that regulating with attention to costs is better, when Congress says the opposite we have to go with the opposite.  And there we said Congress had said the opposite because it had talked about protecting the public health with an adequate margin of safety.  Now, I'm wondering, what does it take in a statute to make us say, look, Congress has demanded that the regulation here occur without any attention to costs?  In other words, essentially Congress has demanded that the regulation has occurred in a fundamentally silly way.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Stewart--   Elena Kagan  --Could you explain that to me, Mr. Stewart?  Because are you saying that the straight proportionality approach that was applied in the D.C. Circuit, are you saying that that's impossible or are you saying it's complicated and dumb?   Elena Kagan  I'm sure I should know this after reading all these briefs, but if we -- if we reverse the D.C. Circuit what would happen going forward?  In other words, the States have had this time to -- to go first and to do their SIPs.  Then they were found not to comply, so the EPA does its FIP.  But that's not the end of the game, is it?  I mean, isn't the EPA under a continuing obligation to look at, review its NAAQS, to give the States further opportunities to come back?   ",12-1182
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Mitchell, I might just not be understanding you, but this goes back to the Chief Justice's question.  The statute says, look, after these standards are originally promulgated, the State gets 3 years to make its best pitch, and then the administrator shall promulgate a FIP at any time within two years after that.  Now, presumably there are lots of conversations that can happen between the EPA and the States during those 5 years, and maybe sometimes more of those conversations happen and sometimes less of those conversations happen.  But I don't see that as different constructions of the statute.  It seems to me as the statute sets up its framework: You go first, do it within 3 years; then the EPA goes, it has to do it within 2 years.  The EPA just has very substantial discretion under this statute as to what kinds of conversations it wants to have when, within that broad structure.  Why am I not reading it right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why can't -- this is of course a statute on which EPA gets substantial Chevron deference.  Why couldn't we read that language to essentially mean subject to the same procedural requirements as the original?   Elena Kagan  Well, it's not a caveat.  It's just a different understanding of what that language means.  I mean, you say it has to be in the exact same -- in the exact same way they previously acted, and I guess I'm saying it could mean subject to the exact same procedural requirements.  Was that not clear?  Was that unclear?   Elena Kagan  Whatever procedural requirements constrained EPA when it approved the SIP, those were the same procedural requirements that constrained EPA when it's disapproved the SIP.  But we're just asking are they -- you know, both are -- have to be subject to the same procedural requirements.  EPA can act differently as long as they are acting within that same set of rules.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I think that they are trying to make that argument.  They are saying, in the initial version we could have done it by notice and comment rulemaking or we could have done it if we had good cause.  So too when we reverse that initial determination.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Keisler, I mean, you have a statute here that clearly does not have any language about no costs allowed, that also does not have what the American Trucking Association statute had, which was like public health only, sufficient margin of safety; right?  So none of that.  What you have is exactly what you said.  You have a statute that focuses on causal contribution, right?  So this is a hard problem, right?  Because -- I mean, let me just sort of give you a numerical example, which I'm sure is as simplistic as the other numerical examples floating around this case.  But, you know, let's say that the standard is a hundred.  And there's a State that has 120, and there are two States, X and Y, that have each contributed 20.  Right?  So we -- you know, we only need 20 of those.  We have 40.  And the question is how do you get from those 40 to those 20.  The D.C. Circuit would just say, well, we take 10 from each.  But if this -- if the question is only about causal contribution and that's all that the statute talks about, there have to be other ways we can make that determination of what contribution each should be legally responsible for, right?  And what the EPA said here was: We're going to distinguish between -- we're going to distinguish between States that have -- have put a lot of technology and a lot of money into this already and on the other hand States that have lots of cheap and dirty emissions.  And why isn't that a perfectly rational thing to do under this very statute?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Keisler, the nature of this problem is that there's an allocation issue.  It's not just everybody gets down to a certain threshold level.  It's there's a level and we have to allocate.  And the question is: What are we going to allocate on the basis of?  And the word ‶ amounts ″ doesn't tell you what you're going to allocate on the basis of.  So there are lots of different choices for what we can allocate on the basis of.  We can just divide, you know, and do it all proportionally.  We can take into account per capita.  We can take into account a State's population if we wanted to.  Or we can take into account, as the EPA did here, costs on the understanding that costs reflect how much of an investment a State has already made in pollution technology.  So the statute, neither the word ‶ amount ″ nor anything else says anything about those different methods of allocation, does it?   ",12-1182
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Telscher, could I just ask very quickly the factors that you would think a Court should consider.  One is the degree to which the case is meritless.  Another I presume is bad faith.  Another is litigation misconduct.  Is there anything else or are those the three?   Elena Kagan  But I think, Mr. Martinez, what the Chief Justice is driving at is there's a bit of a disconnect between your list of factors and those two words.  Gross injustice, I mean that's -- that's really, really exceptional.  That sounds like ""shocks the conscience"".  That sounds like something you've never seen happen in the litigation system ever.  But then you're saying essentially ratchet it down when you list all of these various factors.  And maybe that's right, we shouldn't be obsessed with this word ""gross injustice"".  It just seems a disconnect between the two words and all the factors.   Roman Martinez  Let me -- let me explain by stepping back.   ",12-1184

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Halligan, could we talk about the claim that she did bring?   Elena Kagan  So your reading of the statute basically makes everything after the semicolon completely superfluous.  And I think you would agree with that, wouldn't you?   Elena Kagan  But that is what the first provision does.  When it says pregnancy is the same as sex, when we say because of sex, we also say because of pregnancy, all of that would be taken care of by that clause.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So -- so you are saying it's not doing anything new; it's only explaining the old stuff.  And okay.  Tell me why that's necessary?   Elena Kagan  I think, again, that that is not necessary, because all that the inquiry would be is were you discriminated against because you were pregnant?  Yes, I was.  No, I wasn't.  You don't need any of this other stuff about what the comparator class is.  And, in fact, you are creating a kind of double redundancy.  It's everything past the semicolon is redundant, but then, moreover, the key words here, which is  ""other persons not so affected but similar in their ability or inability to work. ""  that becomes redundant even within the redundancy.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That seems the -- that is the question that this language raises, right?  Which is why source?  But why not a seniority limitation or something like that?  Could I give you an alternative way to understand what the statute is doing?  Which is -- what we ought to be thinking about is McDonnell Douglas.  In other words, this -- this provides the comparator.  It says an employee can find a class of people who are being given an accommodation notwithstanding that those people are similarly situated with respect to work.  An employee points to that class.  And then in a typical McDonnell Douglas fashion, the employer comes back and says: No, there is a good reason why I'm treating that class differently that has nothing to do with pregnancy.  It has something to do with I always treat more senior employees differently or something like that.  And at that point, if the if the employer makes his case, the employee gets to come back and say, no, that is a pretext, in just the way we do with every other discrimination case.  And that's what this is all about.  It's identifying the comparator that the employee has to identify in the first instance in order to shift the burden to the government to come back with a reason.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Halligan, what is wrong with my middle ground?  It's not that Mr. Bagenstos and the General's ground, because it allows the employer to come back and say: I have a legitimate policy based on seniority, or even I have a legitimate policy based on the source of the injury.  But it does put that as a question whenever an employee is able to point to a similar -- to a class of people who are granted the disability accommodation who aren't pregnant.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Quite the opposite.  It basically gives a function for what -- the key words of the statute are  ""other persons not so affected but similar in their ability and inability to work. ""  What is that doing?  What it does is it points to the comparator that sets off the McDonnell Douglas test, that forces the employer to come back and give a reason for why it is that this ought not to be taken as discrimination against pregnancy.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Halligan, suppose this--   Elena Kagan  --Suppose this, and it's exactly what Justice Breyer is talking about.  Suppose you had a policy that said we're going to provide accommodations to -- for anybody with a -- a nonoccupational sickness and and accident.  Very similar to Gilbert--   Elena Kagan  --but without all the other facts of Gilbert.  We're just -- it's a facial policy.   Elena Kagan  We're going to provide accommodations, but, of course, pregnancy is not a nonoccupational sickness and accident, so as a result of this facially neutral policy, pregnant women will not get accommodations.  Now, as I understand what you are saying, it's -- that's perfectly fine.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, this is nonoccupational sickness and accident.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's where we disagree because -- because what this tells you is it tells you what the comparators are.  The comparators are any class you can come up with who is -- is -- has the same disability and isn't pregnant, and then the employer can come back and say, no, we had a good reason to -- to treat that class of employees differently.  And if you -- if you buy that with respect to the Gilbert distinction, I don't understand why you wouldn't buy it with respect to any other classification.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But we absolutely know that what Gilbert -- was said was that kind of policy was legitimate and that Congress came back and said, no, that kind of policy is illegitimate, right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But as I understand the answer to my question, and tell me if I'm wrong, is you're saying with respect to a facially neutral policy as to nonoccupational sickness and health--   Elena Kagan  --that you think that -- that is illegal under the PDA.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry--   Elena Kagan  --Even if it's -- it's exactly the policy that's in Gilbert, and you're saying that's fine?   Elena Kagan  It didn't.  There were lots of other things except for pregnancy that got excluded in Gilbert.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If -- if a man had a vasectomy, it got excluded in Gilbert.  If somebody got into a bar fight, it got excluded under the policy in Gilbert.  If a person had cosmetic surgery, it got excluded under the policy in Gilbert.  Gilbert was about much more than singling out.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Halligan, for the democratic process to work as it should, the PDA has to be given a fair reading.  And what we know about the PDA is that it was supposed to be about removing stereotypes of pregnant women as marginal workers.  It was supposed to be about ensuring that they wouldn't be unfairly excluded from the workplace.  And what you are saying is that there's a policy that accommodates some workers, but puts all pregnant women on one side of the line.  And what you are further saying is that the employer doesn't even have to justify that policy ala McDonnell Douglas.  That seems to me a reading of the statute, the PDA, that ignores two-thirds of the text.   INTERRUPTING ",12-1226

Could I -- along the lines of what Justice Ginsburg was saying, suppose that the Hornes had given over all the raisins, right, but that they thought that this was improper, that this marketing order was -- it was a violation of the takings clause.  Could they have gone to the Court of Claims via the Tucker Act and said, we want our money back?  They gave -- they gave over the raisins, they say we're entitled to compensation.  Could they have gone through the Court of Claims?   Elena Kagan  In other words, the Hornes did what the marketing order suggested they should do.  They gave over the raisins.  But they said this is just improper.  You're saying they could go to the Court of Claims?   Elena Kagan  Okay.

As to the compensation part, it seems to me you have a pretty decent Apfel argument.  But as to the penalty part, I don't really understand how the Apfel argument would go.  It seems to me that as to the penalty part, the key thing is that if they had handed over the raisins, they could have gone to the Court of Federal Claims and had the compensation done there.  And the fact that the Government is penalizing them for not complying with the marketing order does not fall within the rationale of Apfel.   ",12-123X

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Mr. Palmore, if you are conceding now that this is not jurisdictional, it seems to me that your Tucker Act argument as a substantive argument, I mean, has been waived.  You didn't raise that argument until the rehearing petition.   Elena Kagan  Well, why is that a necessary part of Apfel?  Why didn't Apfel just mean when we are dealing with cash you don't have to go to the Court of Claims?  So even if -- you know, you can have a discussion in the district court about whether it's not dollar-for-dollar and it should be discounted in some way.  But why should the fact that its dollar-for-dollar mean -- why is that a requirement, as opposed to just it's cash and so the question of, like, you know, handing some -- handing it all over and getting some back, that can be done in the district court rather than making somebody file a separate suit?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Palmore, what would be wrong -- would anything be wrong -- with a -- with a disposition of this Court that went something like this: Everybody agrees that this is not a jurisdictional issue, including the Government, so they got that wrong.  Now, as to this whole business about the Tucker Act and whether the Tucker Act provides a remedy, the Government only started talking about that in a petition for rehearing en banc, and the Government can't do that.  You know, it can't introduce an argument like this in a petition for rehearing en banc.  So that's waived.  And now, the Ninth Circuit can go and try to figure out whether this marketing order is a taking or it's just the world's most outdated law.  [Laughter]   ",12-123X

Elena Kagan  But I thought we said in Missouri v. Holland that AEDPA was -- was enacted against a background rule which stated that normal equitable principles, such as this one, which had been applied everywhere to all procedural bars, that AEDPA suggested that those would -- wouldn't fit -- AEDPA was against a background that those would continue to apply.   Elena Kagan  And why is a Federal statute of limitations any different?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, but again, it's Congress that we said in Holland, that it's Congress and AEDPA has -- has -- was drafted against this presumption that normal equitable principles would apply.   Elena Kagan  But again, why would Congress have thought that there would be any difference in -- with respect to a statute of limitations?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that applies to States as well.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Bursch, you suggested earlier some way out of this puzzle about why Congress would have put the actual-innocence exception into the second successive petition provision, and not had one for a first petition--   Elena Kagan  --But that seems really quite odd to me.  I mean, a number of my colleagues have said can we really believe that Congress contemplated this.  But, I mean, don't we have evidence that Congress contemplated it, in the second and successive context, a slightly tighter version, wouldn't it be quite odd to say that Congress contemplated an actual-innocence exception when you are on your second petition but barred it when you are on your first?  What sense would that be.   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I'm just not sure I understand that.  I mean, they could have added a separate provision.  Just saying, there's an actual-innocence exception or there is -- there's not consistent with the way they did it in the second and successive petition.   Elena Kagan  Well, it didn't have to.  Why would it have necessarily limited (d)(1)(D)?   Elena Kagan  Well, you just you make the converse clear.

0,"Elena Kagan  General, I think you're -- you're not answering the real thrust of the Chief Justice's question, which is that we could just be back here if we -- if we said, well, they didn't phrase this in the right way.  Well, they'll phrase it differently and we would be back here with the same essential problem, that you're asking us to peg this on a formality that the Senate could easily evade, and that suggests that it really is the Senate's job to determine whether they're in recess or whether they're not.   Elena Kagan  General, would you agree that this clause now is not mostly used to deal with emergencies arising from congressional absence?  That most modern Presidents -- and I say this sort of going -- going back to President Reagan, Presidents of both parties essentially have used this clause as a way to deal, not with congressional absence, but with congressional intransigence, with a Congress that simply does not want to approve appointments that the President thinks ought to be approved?  You know, absence in this day and age -- this is not the horse and buggy era anymore.  There's no real -- there's no such thing truly as congressional absence anymore.  And that makes me wonder whether we're dealing here with what's essentially an historic relic, something whose original purpose has disappeared and has assumed a new purpose that nobody ever intended it to have.   Elena Kagan  Yes, as a result of congressional refusal, not as a result of congressional action.   Elena Kagan  General, I think that's a really strong argument, but I have to say I'm not sure it applies consistently throughout each of the three claims that you make.  Because if you are going to rely on history and on the development of an equilibrium with respect to what “ happens ” means, and if you are going to do that again with respect to whether intra-session recesses are included, then it seems to me you also have to look to history and the development of an equilibrium with respect to Congress's definition of its own power to determine whether they are in recess or not.  In other words, your third argument about pro forma sessions, the history is entirely on the Senate's side, not on your side.  And if we're going to take a kind of continuing practice and the development of equilibrium seriously, you might win on questions 1 and 2 and then lose on question 3.   Elena Kagan  Suppose it was -- suppose it was the exact same no-business order, but the single senator who was there got up and asked for unanimous consent to name a post office, and every three days, he got up and said unanimous consent to name a post office.  The post office is named.  So they can do, you know, trivial business in each of these sessions.  Would that make a constitutional difference?   Elena Kagan  But that, again, suggests that the rule that you're asking us to establish is -- is so easy to evade that why bother establishing it at all.  The fact that it's so easy to evade suggests that this really is -- the question of how to define a recess really does belong to the Senate.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I totally take your point on that.  But what I'm suggesting is they can just come back, and by naming post offices, have the same effect, that they would write it out of the -- of the Constitution as much as you say this does.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Estrada, you said in your brief that that was true within wide limits.  What are the wide limits?     This is -- this is all about how the Senate chooses to arrange its affairs, Justice Kagan, under the Rules of Proceedings Act.  And what the Court said in the Ballin case was that the exercise of rulemaking authority by Congress was almost absolute and beyond the challenge of any body or tribunal unless it usurped some independent constitutional authority.  The only possible offer here that the Solicitor General has as to how the Constitution could have been violated by the actions of the Senate in arranging its own affairs is the notion that this has invaded the purported recess appointments power of the President.  And the reason, as we say in our brief, why that is completely insubstantial is because, as the Solicitor General recognizes in the closing two pages of its brief, the Senate by the design of the Constitution, the Appointment Clause, the primary method of appointment, has an absolute veto over nominations.  The Framers could not have been more clear that the standard power of appointment was a joint power of appointment.  And therefore, the Solicitor General is forced to concede that this appointment power, this right that the President is asserting here as a stop on the exercise of the rulemaking authority, is a subsidiary power that only arises if the government -- if the Senate, excuse me, chooses to recess.   Elena Kagan  Is the Chief Justice's example before, if the Senate just said, we're -- we're never in recess for purposes of appointments, would that be permissible.     If the Senate says, we're never in recess, and the Senate then is not in recess so that it could exercise the duties of its office as it does here, yes, it would be.  If the Senate says, We're checking out and going to Hawaii, we'll never again be in Washington, Kona is very nice this time of year, that would not be permissible, because, A, the Adjournment Clause requires the consent of the House for the Senate to be not only gone for 3 days but to be in a different place.  And -- and second, you know, the Senate cannot leave, you know, the chamber, and -- other than with the -- with the consent of the House.  And maybe if the Senate has effectively given up, you know, the business of legislating, in that case, maybe the President could say that it is, quote, a “ recess ”.  Now, the fundamental problem with the President's position here is twofold.  We have Senate records.  There is -- the Journal Clause of the Constitution directs each house of the Congress to have a journal of its proceedings.  The Journal of the Senate, which is in relevant part printed in our appendix, shows that on each of the disputed dates the Senate was called to order and then adjourned.  It is an official record of the Senate.  It says the Senate was called to order and then adjourned.  It doesn't say: Two guys who happened to be Senators met at a bar and had a beer.  The official records of the Senate say: The Senate was called to order and adjourned.  And under the Rules of Proceedings Clause, that would be conclusive, full stop.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco, I'm sorry, but could we go back to Justice Alito's question, because I really have the same issue with your argument.  You know, suppose that on one -- let's say the “ happens ” argument, that yours is at least the most natural reading of the statute, at least the way we understand the word “ happen ” today, and maybe a compelled reading, but the history points so much in the other direction; and that that history brings with it a whole set of practices and traditions and ways of dealing with each other that has grown around a certain interpretation of what “ happens ” means, right?  The idea that we would wake up one fine morning and chuck all of that because all of a sudden we happened to read the clause, I mean, that at least needs to be defended.   Elena Kagan  I know, but now, you're -- you're again -- I mean, assume that there is a 200-year-old established practice, everybody has agreed to it, but the text, when you really look at it, points the other way.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco, tell me if I am wrong about this, but it seems to me that intra-session recesses really only arose in the 1940s or so, right?  There is the period with Andrew Johnson and Andrew Johnson used intra-recess -- intra-session recesses to make a lot of appointments.  Other than that, intra-session recesses of more than 3 days that are not Christmas simply do not exist.  So that assume that as intra-session recesses came to be Presidents started making appointments in them.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco, can I ask a question about the second question presented, the “ happens ” question?   Elena Kagan  And if you put aside all the history and you look only at the language and you look only at our own modern view of what happens, that surely seems to favor your position.  But if, you know, given all the statements in the founding period itself about how this is ambiguous and it might have two meanings, if you look at the dictionaries of that time -- so I went back and I looked at the Oxford English Dictionary, and one of the definitions of “ happens ” there is “ chance to be ”, essentially the exact same definition that Thomas Jefferson said made this ambiguous.  And we would never use “ happens ” in that way now.  If you look at the examples that the Oxford English gives, they're laughable.  Nobody would ever say that now.  But it just suggested to me that maybe what we think is pretty clear is only pretty clear because one meaning of happens has, you know, over 200 years--   Elena Kagan  --lapsed.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, I don't think so.  Essentially, Thomas Jefferson says it could mean one thing or the other, and the other thing that he said, which is “ happens to exist ”, is sort of exactly this old definition, which is “ happens ” means “ chance to be ”.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You know, I don't remember them exactly.  I just remember kind of laughing at them, as things that--  [Laughter]   Elena Kagan  --nobody would say--   ",12-1281
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Bibas, I would have thought that there was something in the copyright context that cuts against you, and that's that because of this separate accrual rule and the feature of these roll-in statutes of limitations combined with very, very lengthy copyrights terms, that essentially a plaintiff can not bring suit for years, decades and time the suit in order to maximize her own gain.  That strikes me as something that we don't usually see in statute of limitations cases.  I mean, you don't have very many cases where courts have applied laches as against the statute of limitations, but that's because you can't think of many instances in which it would be considered unfair to take the entire statute of limitations to bring a suit.  But in this context, you look at something that seems very different.  A plaintiff can wait 20 years given the way the separate accrual work -- rule works.   Elena Kagan  We don't make that distinction with respect to equitable tolling.  Why would we make it here?   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, because the history is different.  The history that this Court recognized in cases like Mack, for example, 1935 case, where that was a legal claim.  The Court said, laches within a term of the statute of limitations, is no defense at law.  And the Court has continued to pick up that language in case after case.  There are numerous cases cited in the briefs.  There was a 1985--   ",12-1315
0,"Elena Kagan  ‶ Bizarre ″ seems to me a little strong, because I take it that Mr. Bibas is making a statutory argument -- I mean, he's saying not the language of the statute, but he's saying what was Congress thinking at the time.  Congress was faced with all of these precedents, essentially saying laches was not available.  There are no cases out there really where laches does cut into a defined statute of limitations period.  And then you have the feature that if Congress knew that it was enacting these rolling statutes of limitations, you would have thought that it might have been foremost in their head, how are we going to prevent somebody from suing 30 years later.  And they did nothing of the kind.  They could very easily have made it clear that laches applied or they could have set an outer limit or they could have done a number of things, and they really didn't do any of them.  So how are we to account for all that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The Ninth Circuit here used this language of presumption.  It said,  ""If any part of the alleged wrongful conduct occurred outside of the limitations period, courts presume that the plaintiff's claims are barred by laches. ""  and you just said laches is, at least in part, a prejudice doctrine.   Elena Kagan  Do you concede that that presumption is wrong?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's one -- you know, one understanding of the opinion is, Look, that's just nothing.  Do you agree with it?   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess partly that suggests a burden of persuasion, but partly it suggests just a kind of starting position is that if there was conduct outside the limitations period it was prejudicial.  And I guess I want to know why that would be.   Elena Kagan  One can agree with that and not think that if conduct happened three years and two days earlier that the burden of coming forward and the necessity to give a reason flips to the other side.   Elena Kagan  Is your argument limited to that?  Would you say laches is also available when there's no continuing violation or when there's no rolling period?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Perry, what troubles me a bit about your argument is I think the dearth of cases on this is probably explainable by the fact that people just haven't thought that they had a laches defense when a plaintiff brought a suit within a statute of limitations period.  And now, if we open this all up, grant it in a statutory context in which it makes some sense to give people a laches defense, if we open this all up, we'll be seeing motions that nobody ever dreamed of before.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Kellogg, do you think that if in your arbitration agreement you had a clause which just said, I hereby agree not to bring any Sherman Act claim against American Express, could -- could your arbitration agreement do that?   Elena Kagan  It -- it couldn't, right, because we would say no, there has to be an -- an opportunity for a vindication of statutory rights; is that right?   Elena Kagan  And -- and suppose that the arbitration clause said something different.  Suppose that the arbitration clause said, I -- I hereby agree that I will not present any economic evidence in an antitrust action against American Express.  Could it do that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, even putting aside State unconscionability principles, wouldn't you think that our Mitsubishi case and our Randolph case would again come in and say, my gosh, this arbitration clause prevents any effective vindication of the rights to bring an antitrust suit.  Wouldn't you say that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you think -- I'm sorry.  Go ahead.   Elena Kagan  So I just want to make sure I understand your answer, which is that you read Mitsubishi and Randolph as so narrow that you would say that the principle that they embody does not prevent American Express from saying, you cannot produce -- you cannot use any economic expert or any economic testimony in an antitrust suit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, my -- my question is not about class procedures, it's about allowing economic evidence to help prove your claim.  And you said, no problem, even though it is, of course, true in the real world that to prove a successful antitrust claim, you need economic evidence.   Elena Kagan  And you said that's fine, because you're going to read Mitsubishi and Randolph in such a way that it allows an arbitration clause to 100 percent effectively absolutely frustrate your ability to bring a Sherman Act suit.   Elena Kagan  Well, I think -- I think what they are saying is something a little bit different, which is that if you go -- if you accept my premise that the arbitration clause could not say no economic evidence, what the Respondents here are saying is, well, now you have to give us the ability to produce economic evidence and maybe that involves class procedures, maybe it involves something else.  It could involve some other cost-sharing mechanism.  But if the arbitration clause works to prevent us from sharing costs in such a way that we can produce that evidence, then once again we have a problem about completely frustrating the effect of the Sherman Act.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Kellogg, are you suggesting that you can win an antitrust suit in arbitration without presenting economic evidence of such things as monopoly power, antitrust injury, damages?  How could somebody do that?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Kellogg, could I go back to Justice Alito's point, because I'm not sure I quite understood your -- your answer to it.  Essentially, the claim here, right, is that this is a party with a monopolistic power such that -- and this is just the Plaintiff's allegation, it may or may not be true, but -- but they say that American Express is using its market power to impose particular contract terms.  And they have a tying thing, but it could just as easily be the case that American Express could be using its economic power to impose terms essentially making arbitration of antitrust claims impossible.  And why shouldn't we understand this problem as connected to the very allegation that's being brought?  That, you know, how is it, how is it going to be possible in a case where there's a monopoly power able -- able to impose contracts terms that -- that you can create an arbitration clause which essentially prevents that from being challenged?   Elena Kagan  And, Mr. Kellogg--   Elena Kagan  --Just to be sure I understand it, that you're saying that it does not violate the confidentiality agreement of this clause to -- to all get together and produce one report?   Elena Kagan  Okay.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And did -- did you say that below as well, that -- that the confidentiality clause does not sweep so widely as to prevent this?  Because clearly, the court below thought that the confidentiality clause did sweep so widely as to prevent this.   Elena Kagan  So but you're saying the confidentiality position would not apply in that circumstance.   ",12-133X
1,"Elena Kagan  And, Mr. -- Mr. Stewart, isn't that also consistent with the way the Court addressed the issue in Randolph?  Because what the Court said there was it might be that these arbitration fees are prohibitive.  And if those arbitration fees are prohibitive, then this doctrine kicks in.  And it didn't look to say, well, let's compare how these fees relate to whatever costs you would wind up with in litigation.  It just said, if the arbitration fees are prohibitive in such -- in such a manner that it prevents you from vindicating your Federal claim in arbitration, that's enough.   INTERRUPTING ",12-133X

Do you agree with that or disagree with that?  And if you disagree with that, what's your standard for what we should be thinking about in -- under 10(a)(4).   Elena Kagan  And you don't disagree, do you, that this arbitrator -- if you read his opinion, you might think it's terribly wrong, but that what he's doing is trying to construe a contract.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, but he is going -- but he's looking at the words, that he's trying to figure out what the parties agreed on when there's no explicit statement about what the parties agreed on.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So now you're saying that he exceeded his authority because he didn't apply a kind of clear statement presumption.  But I don't think that we've ever suggested that there is such a clear statement presumption.  In Stolt-Nielsen, we said that if the parties have stipulated that they haven't agreed on anything, then we're not going to accept class arbitration.  But we've not said that in the process of construing an agreement there is a clear statement rule.  Now, maybe we should have said that, but, you know, it's -- it's no place in our case law now.

How are the laws of the 50 States constructed?  Are we going to have -- are you going to have, a terrible difficulty prosecuting real, you know, punch-in-the-nose kinds of incidents of physical violence, because there are indivisible statutes that apply to both?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, presumably, if they're divisible, you don't have a problem.  The only time you're going to have a problem -- and, again, I'm assuming that the Court will say physical touching goes too far, that that's not included under 922.  So you'll have a problem as to any State statute that indivisibly makes illegal both -- both offensive touching and more violent forms of activity.  How many statutes are like that?

It didn't say anything about serious pain or grievous injury.  It just said force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.  That's what Johnson said.  Why would we adopt a different approach?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  I mean, it specified it is not involving any level, that -- that there was no inquiry into level.  It's force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's the clear standard in the holding.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Sherry said 14.  And is that your view, too?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Rothfeld, how serious do you think the injury has to be?  What -- what counts as serious enough injury?   Elena Kagan  But Mr. Rothfeld, this might go back to our difference on what Johnson said.  But you're asking us to apply a higher standard than Johnson, which just said force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person without any notion of seriousness or grievousness or whatnot.  And, you know, I -- I can see an argument that says we should apply the exact same standard as Johnson.  I can see an argument that says actually, we should apply a lower standard because this is misdemeanors rather than felonies, but I guess I can't see an argument about why we should apply a higher standard than Johnson.

If you had -- if BG and the Republic of Argentina had itself entered into this agreement, would you agree that this is a typical Howsam kind of provision?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Blackman, could you sort of indulge an assumption for me?  And the assumption is that if this provision were in an agreement between two parties, we would treat it as a Howsam-John Wiley kind of provision; in other words, we would say that this is just a procedural rule.  That's the side of the line it falls on.  So my question to you is: Why should this be any different?  You're treating yourself as though you never made an agreement.  But, in fact, you did make an important agreement.  You made an agreement with the U.K., the entire point and purpose of which was to allow U.K. citizens to bring certain kinds of disputes before an arbitrator.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Lefkowitz, could I understand something just about the scope of your argument?  It -- it seems to me that in this case we are not really dealing with generics; we are also dealing with brand-named drugs.  And I guess the -- the thought there would be, in -- with -- with -- in this respect, as to design, as compared to warnings, but as to design, they're really all in the same boat.  In other words, you know, they have a design; that it is only that design that's approved.  If they change their design there's no authority to continue marketing it.  They have to go back to square one.  And that's just as true of brand names as it is of generics.  So am I right about that?  That -- that if we're just looking at a pure design defect claim, putting the warning card aside, where you are in a different position from the brand-name drugs, but as to design, don't the brand-name and the generics go hand in hand?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I want you to put that aside for me for just a second, and I understand that's a very significant thing in your argument to put aside.  But let's just assume that there was a design defect claim that didn't have to do with warnings, where you are in a different position.  Let's just assume on a pure design defect claim, am I right that generics and brand-name manufacturers are in the same position with respect to those claims?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So I'm asking you.   Elena Kagan  But, you -- but again, and I know that this is a big part of your argument, but to the extent that a warning was not involved in the claim, and it was just about the design of a drug, I guess I'm asking you, is there any possible way to distinguish between generics and brand-name manufacturers?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Lefkowitz, I think in describing the FDCA just now, you used the word “ authorizes ”, and typically, when we think about impossibility, it's not enough that a State law penalizes what Federal law authorizes.  What we -- something is impossible when a State law penalizes what Federal law requires or maybe -- or, where State law penalizes what Federal law gives you a right to do.  But it's not enough for impossibility that State law penalizes what Federal law permits.  And it seems as though what we have in the FDCA is a statute that authorizes, that says, you can sell this.  But it doesn't say you must sell it, and it doesn't give you a right to sell it.   Elena Kagan  Well, that is your best case, but, you know, there are quite a number of cases where we've really held when a Federal law permits something, typically, a State can do more if it wants to.   Elena Kagan  I mean, that suggests that there is an obligation of the Federal government.  If there is one, yes, there's a conflict and yes, there's an impossibility defense.  But if there's no obligation, if all there is, is permission from the Federal government, where do you get the impossibility from?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I take that point, Mr. Yang.  I take that point, Mr. Yang, but I think then you're -- you're saying something quite deep about the FDCA, which is that the FDCA should not be thought of as merely authorizing drug sales.  You're saying essentially that when the -- when the FDA does what it does, it's saying not just -- you know, you can do this if you want to, but you can do this and we really think this drug ought to be marketed.  So that when States take action against that, you know, it's -- it's a conflict.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that's--   Elena Kagan  --and that's something I don't think we've really ever said.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Frederick, it -- it does seem to me, and I understand that there's a waiver argument floating around here, but it does seem to me that this case was litigated such that the adequacy of the warning is really all over this case.  There was expert testimony about the adequacy of the warning, there were jury instructions about the adequacy of the warning.  In the closing statements that the lawyer gave, it was -- there was a lot of talk about -- that the FDA's decision to change the label, to show that the label was ineffective before.  So there is just all over this stuff about adequacy of the warning, which does suggest that this is sort of within the four corners of Mensing.   Elena Kagan  Well, how can that be, Mr. Frederick, because the plaintiff really spent a large portion of their case trying to show this, that the warning was inadequate.  So the plaintiff must have thought that there was a possibility that if the warning was adequate, the jury would find one thing, but if the warning was not adequate, liability would follow.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I just -- if you would on the hypothetical: Could a State just assign to anybody the ability to do this?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Cooper, could I just understand your argument.  In reading the briefs, it seems as though your principal argument is that same-sex and opposite -- opposite-sex couples are not similarly situated because opposite-sex couples can procreate, same-sex couples cannot, and the State's principal interest in marriage is in regulating procreation.  Is that basically correct?   Elena Kagan  Is -- is there -- so you have sort of a reason for not including same-sex couples.  Is there any reason that you have for excluding them?  In other words, you're saying, well, if we allow same-sex couples to marry, it doesn't serve the State's interest.  But do you go further and say that it harms any State interest?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, could you explain that a little bit to me, just because I did not pick this up in your briefs.  What harm you see happening and when and how and -- what -- what harm to the institution of marriage or to opposite-sex couples, how does this cause and effect work?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, suppose a State said, Mr. Cooper, suppose a State said that, Because we think that the focus of marriage really should be on procreation, we are not going to give marriage licenses anymore to any couple where both people are over the age of 55.  Would that be constitutional?   Elena Kagan  Because that's the same State interest, I would think, you know.  If you are over the age of 55, you don't help us serve the Government's interest in regulating procreation through marriage.  So why is that different?   Elena Kagan  No, really, because if the couple -- I can just assure you, if both the woman and the man are over the age of 55, there are not a lot of children coming out of that marriage.

So you're saying that in that case, the gun dealer runs the background check on the person who hands the gun dealer the credit card as opposed to the person who will be the actual recipient of the gun?  Is that what you're saying the statute requires?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Dietz, can we go back to the question that Justice Alito raised.  The primary object of this statute is to keep guns out of hands of felons, of people with mental illness and so forth.  Now, it's absolutely true, as you have said, that Congress didn't do everything it could have to achieve that result, right?  That there are many kinds of resales that are allowable, that there are gifts that are allowable.  It's one thing to say that.

I mean, that goes far beyond the other kinds of resale possibilities that you're talking about.  And I guess what I want to know is why you think a Congress that was geared towards this object of keeping guns out of the hands of dangerous people and set up a mechanism that had the gun seller be the kind of enforcer, at the point of sale, would have thought, oh, it's fine if a front, if a straw walks in the door.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Palmore, is that right?  I thought that Mr. Dietz's argument went beyond what Justice Scalia just said, that for Mr. Dietz, regarding -- you can -- he might be prosecuted under another statute for selling something to somebody he knows is Al Capone, but that he was -- you know, because he was the guy at the counter and he was buying for somebody else, as to this question of material representation, it does not matter whether the ultimate transferee was Al Capone or somebody else.   Elena Kagan  I think he said that just right in here.   Elena Kagan  If you're right on Question 1, 922(t) just makes this a slam dunk on Question 2.  And there's a question about whether you are right on Question 1.  But if you are, (t) says, look, the dealer is supposed to check the transferee, right?  And if we assume that when Congress says ""the transferee"", it's the real transferee, not the fake transferee, the dealer is supposed to check the real transferee.  So what does the dealer think is material?  I mean, the question is: What does a reasonable dealer think is material?  I better know who you are so I can check you.  That's material.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's not just the structure -- it's not just the overriding purpose.  922(t) says that the dealer is supposed to check the transferee to find out whether the transferee has a criminal record, to find out whether the transferee has mental illness.  So who does he check?  Who is the transferee?  Well, I need to know who the transferee is to make that check.  So, obviously, it's material to know who the transferee is.   ",12-1493

Could the treaty have been self-executing?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Where would you find that in the Constitution?  Because there's clearly a treaty power that does not have subject matter limitations.

So you have to find a constraint on the treaty power.  Where does it come from?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, could I make sure I understand your test?  Your test is to say that with respect to every prosecution under this -- under this treaty, that a court has to ask whether the prosecution has a sufficient nexus to national or international concerns?  Is that -- is that your test?   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I'm still looking for a test and I thought that the test that I just articulated was really directly out of your briefs.  But if it's -- but if -- if you're suggesting that that's not the test, give me the test that we're supposed to ask with respect to this case or any other as to whether the prosecution is unconstitutional.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That sounds like a facial challenge.  Now, I thought that you made very careful to talk about that this was an as-applied challenge to this particular prosecution.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you're saying if the statute extends to things that we've generally thought of as part of the police power, that's sufficient.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Nexus, nexus to a national concern, again, is what I understood you to say in your brief.  But let me give you a hypothetical and you tell me whether your test meets it.  Let's say it's the same convention except it relates only to Sarin gas, and -- and there's a chemist out there and, you know, the -- the implementing legislation mirrors the convention.  There's a chemist out there who manufactures Sarin gas -- I take it it's pretty easy to manufacture -- and sends it through the ducts of a house and kills everybody in it.

In my hypothetical, it's a completely domestic use.  You know, it's just this chemist didn't like his neighbor and used Sarin gas.  And you're saying what the difference is, well, what the treaty makers did was to find the category of chemicals more broadly.  And I guess what I want to know is, you are imagining a world in which judges day to day try to get inside the head of treaty makers to think about, you know, in this case we understand that there's a national interest in regulating Sarin gas, but we don't think that there's a sufficient interest in regulating some other chemical or some other chemical or so on down the line.  It seems to me a completely indeterminate test and one that would have judges take the place of treaty makers in terms of deciding what is in the national and international interest.   Elena Kagan  Well, but, Mr. Clement, it's absolutely clear that the treaty was after enforcement as to individuals with respect to all the prohibitions, that the treaty said: Go enforce this as to individuals and do it consistent with your constitutional processes.  And then Congress passes a law that is consistent with its constitutional processes, and it completely mirrors the treaty.   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm still trying to figure out why.  I mean, Holmes dealt with this in Missouri v. Holland.  He says there's a treaty power, it's an enumerated power, there's a necessary and proper clause that functions to -- to allow Congress to give effect to that treaty power.  It's -- you know, this is a -- a situation where there's a prohibition on the States in terms of entering into treaties or in terms of sharing that power in any way.  And he says, you know, it's just these invisible radiations that you think come from the structure of the Constitution.  And he specifically rejected this argument, the same argument that you're making, the penumbras and emanations of the Constitution.   ",12-158X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, General, could I ask why that is?  I mean, because this -- this Convention and the implementing legislation is very broad and it's broad because it applies to a very large category of weapons and it applies to a very large category of uses, of conduct.  So what were they thinking about, about why they wanted these very broad categories, why it's not more limited with respect either to the chemicals or to the conduct?   Elena Kagan  And, General, don't we have an amicus brief from almost all of the legal counsels of the State Department, Republican and Democrat, talking about how if Petitioner's argument were accepted, it would severely damage the United States' ability to enter into and to negotiate treaties.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Feigin, can I ask you the same question that I asked Mr. Yablon: Do you know of any cases where in these -- where there are really core violations, where a judge exhorts the defendant to plea it -- does the Court ever find that non-prejudicial?   INTERRUPTING ",12-167X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, on that, what's the most minor thing that the government could do that would still count as a Rule 11(c)(1) violation?   Elena Kagan  That the judge could do.  I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Yablon, have we ever said that about the violation of a rule of criminal procedure, that it's structural error no matter what the circumstances?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You worked for her, too, I think.   Elena Kagan  I would think, Mr. Yablon, that one of the effects of what you are asking us to do is that the rule would just get narrower and narrower.  In other words, if automatic reversal is always the effect of finding a violation -- and I think you acknowledge this in a way -- that people will just find fewer and fewer violations.  And I'm wondering why we should do something like that rather than interpret the rule as it was meant to be interpreted, but then say: You know, somebody can look and say it really just didn't matter that it was violated in this case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that seems a bit odd, don't you think, Mr. Yablon?  You know, you're saying, well, there are core violations as opposed to noncore violations.  I mean, presumably, that's part of what the Court would think about when it was doing prejudice analysis.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Yablon, do you know of any case where there is one of these core violations, these exhortation cases, where the Court did not find prejudice?   INTERRUPTING ",12-167X
0,"Elena Kagan  But, Ms. Winfree, that can't be quite right, can it?  I mean, such a person, assume you've been arrested for something, the State doesn't have the right to go search your house for evidence of unrelated crimes; isn't -- isn't that correct?   Elena Kagan  It doesn't have the right to search your car for evidence of unrelated crimes.   Elena Kagan  Just because you've been arrested doesn't mean that you lose the privacy expectations and things you have that aren't related to the offense that you've been arrested for.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, and if there were a real identification purpose for this, then I understand that argument.  But if it's just to solve cold cases, which is the way you started, then it's just like searching your house, to see what's in your house that could help to solve a cold case.   Elena Kagan  Well, but if that's what you're basing it on, then you're not basing it on an arrestee.  I mean, then the Chief Justice is right, it could be any arrestee, no matter how minor the offense.  It could be just any old person in the street.  Why don't we do this for everybody who comes in for a driver's license because it's very effective?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Dreeben, is it really?  Because if this were like fingerprints, I think that you would have a quite good case.  But as I've been reading about this, it seems as though the technology is not the same as the fingerprint technology; and because the technology is different, it is used differently.  Fingerprints you go in, you put in a fingerprint, there is identifying information that comes back to you in 5 minutes, right?  This, you put in something, and Ms. Winfree said was 11 to 17 days, in this case it's four months.  And it doesn't seem to be used because the technology doesn't allow it to be used as the kind of routine identifier that fingerprints does.  So am I wrong about that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Dreeben, could I understand how this works exactly?  The swab is taken, and if I -- there is a database which is known offenders and there is a database which is kind of crime scene DNA; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  And when the swab is taken and it's put into the system, you check that against the crime scene DNA database; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  Do you check it -- does Maryland check it against the known offenders database?   Elena Kagan  Because that suggests that right now it's functioning as let's solve some crimes, which is a good thing, you know, that we should solve some crimes, but not as an identification device.  Because here if it were an identification device you would be comparing it to the known offender database, not to the cold case database.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the typical special needs case is one in which we say there's no law enforcement interest, that there's an interest other than the interest in solving crime.   Elena Kagan  When you started, Mr. Dreeben, you started by saying, you know, they have a reduced expectation of privacy and we have important interests.  You went right into free-form balancing.  That's typically not the way we do it.  If we said to you, look, you know, the way we do it is, you need a warrant, and if you -- there is some exceptions, then you have to put yourself into a well-recognized exception where you can search without a warrant.  And that's especially the case when there is no suspicion whatsoever.  How would you do it?  How would you do it short of free-form balancing?  What exception are you a part of?

1,"Elena Kagan  What are your other two distinctions?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Shanmugam, this seems to me a real distinction in this case as it's been litigated.  I take what the government is saying is something like: Give us 5 years and those won't look very different.  In other words, we will be able to do in 5 years time exactly what we can do with fingerprinting, except it will be, as Justice Breyer says, more accurate.  So we are just about 5 years ahead of that, so give us a break.   Elena Kagan  Just suppose -- I mean, I guess the question is would this be unconstitutional?  It's not the world we are living in now, but let me -- 10 years from now the government says, we are really switching over to a fingerprint system -- to a DNA system and what that system is going to allow us to do, is it's going to allow us to identify, and it's going to allow us to bring up the old criminal history and it's going to allow us to see whether there are also unsolved crimes that we can tag to this person and discover that he's really, really dangerous.  All right?  And so the government puts that system into effect.  Is it constitutional?   INTERRUPTING ",12-207X

In other words, you know, this is a “ may ” provision; would it be a sufficient reason that this is just going to take too long, it's too involved, so I'm going to deny attorneys' fees in this case?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fishman, this may be a hard question for you to answer, but is your sense of why it is that petitions are untimely filed that they usually have to do with things like, you know, snowstorms and lawyer error, or that they usually have to do with questions about the manifestation of symptoms?

0,"Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  Just to nail that down, because your first three words were “ absent an invocation ”.   Elena Kagan  Are you now adopting the Solicitor General's argument, because your brief goes further?  So are you now saying that the crucial thing is the invocation?   Elena Kagan  And so you would agree with the Government that if he had invoked, that the Fifth Amendment right would come into play.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Curry, in a case like Berghuis, which is in a custodial setting, if the defendant there had not ever said anything, had gone through the entire interview and really never said a word, so that the police kept asking him questions, but he never said anything, the prosecutors could then not go in and say, look, for 3 hours, we asked him questions and he didn't talk.  That would be off limits.  And the question is, if that's off limits, why shouldn't this be off limits as well?  If there's no invocation necessary there, for some of the reasons that Justice Ginsburg was saying, why should there be an invocation requirement here?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  I -- I understand that in your case, there happens to be a kind of selective answering sort of question.  But let's say -- let's take that out of the picture, all right?  And just say, you know, he just didn't want to answer questions, all right?  So then the question is, why would that case be any different from the case that I posited?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  He -- he didn't invoke, he just didn't answer.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So you're pinning your argument really on the fact that he did a lot of answering.   Elena Kagan  On this -- on this, you know, you can't pick and choose kind of argument.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So would it be fair to say that your argument is, look, you can't just like keep talking and talking and talking and -- and at that point, you have to invoke?  If -- if you've been doing a lot of talking and then decide you want to stay silent, at that point, you have to invoke.  But that's not to say that you have to invoke in every noncustodial encounter.  Is that your argument?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You took the words out of my mouth.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Curry, Berghuis is different for a different reason.  Berghuis is different because the question in Berghuis is what do you have to do to make the police go away.  Here, the police were not going away.  There was no -- there's no question of that.  But the question is what do you have to do in order to bar the prosecutor from introducing your silence at trial.  So that's a really different question, isn't it?   Elena Kagan  Exactly.  That's why Berghuis is irrelevant here, because Berghuis said at a certain point, you know, you need to invoke in order to stop questioning.  But -- but that's not what's at issue here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Anders?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  We don't require invocation at trial, and we don't require invocation in a custodial setting.  And you might think, well, custodial, that's very different because, after all, custodial is inherently coercive, but that's the whole point of Miranda warnings, is that once we give Miranda warnings, that coercion is dispelled and the custodial setting essentially becomes like a noncustodial setting.  So if we don't require invocation even after Miranda warnings are given in a custodial setting, why should we require invocation here?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, because then when--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --you're given the warnings, and then that's gone.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What -- what does that mean?  Does he just -- how about if he just said,  ""You know, I don't really want to answer that question? ""   Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Anders, suppose, you know, he thinks that the interview is going to be one thing and then it turns out that the interview was something else.  He realizes, it dawns on him that the police really do see him as a suspect.  And he says to himself, I better stop answering, right?  So he says, okay -- he's answered a bunch of questions already, but -- but now he's -- you know, I don't want to answer any more questions.  Is that an invocation?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Or if he says, I don't want to answer questions about a particular topic; is that an invocation?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That doesn't sound like a clear rule.  I mean, you know, as -- as between, you know, I don't want to answer those questions on a particular topic, I don't want to answer that question, or just like could we go on to a different question or -- or I don't know.

Now, the Government is willing to pay that $300,000, would be happy to pay that $300,000, but whether the Government is happy or sad to pay that $300,000, the Government is still paying the $300,000, which in the usual set of circumstances is the classic Article III injury.  Why isn't it here?

So let's say that the Attorney General decides that a particular application of the statute is unconstitutional and decides to give up on that application.

Could Congress then come in?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, for the most part and historically, the only uniformity that the Federal Government has pursued is that it's uniformly recognized the marriages that are recognized by the State.  So, this was a real difference in the uniformity that the Federal Government was pursuing.  And it suggests that maybe something -- maybe Congress had something different in mind than uniformity.  So we have a whole series of cases which suggest the following: Which suggest that when Congress targets a group that is not everybody's favorite group in the world, that we look at those cases with some -- even if they're not suspect -- with some rigor to say, do we really think that Congress was doing this for uniformity reasons, or do we think that Congress's judgment was infected by dislike, by fear, by animus, and so forth?  I guess the question that this statute raises, this statute that does something that's really never been done before, is whether that sends up a pretty good red flag that that's what was going on.

So why wasn't it -- why wasn't that the theory of the case?   Elena Kagan  Do you think there's an obstacle to charging a case that way?  Mr. Clement seems to think that there's an obstacle, that even though there's property in that case, there's some other problem with charging the case that way.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Harrington, go back to the Scheidler example, because that was a case where we said there was not extortion when there were threats of violence meant to close down an abortion clinic's operations.  What you are suggesting is that if those threats of violence had been targeted at the abortion clinic's lawyer in order to get him to tell the clinic to shut down their operations because they were a violation of law, that it would be an entirely different case.  Now, how could that be?

In other words, what's the point of making him a parent under that definitional section if he doesn't get any of the protections that 1912 provides for when to terminate rights?   Elena Kagan  But what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets no parental rights under the statute and if the termination provisions don't apply to him?   Elena Kagan  But what are they supposed to--   Elena Kagan  --Well, how are they significant?  I mean, I'm trying to understand this, because if you get notice, but then you have nothing to say in the proceeding because the statute gives you no rights and the statute doesn't provide any standards for terminating those rights--   Elena Kagan  --what are you supposed to do once you get notice?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think you're not answering the question of what's the point of labeling him a parent if he gets none of the protections that the Act provides to a parent?   Elena Kagan  Ms. Blatt, continuing on the assumption that this man is a parent under the statutory definition, what your argument seems to be suggesting is that there are really two classes of parents under the statute, right, that everybody is labeled a parent, but then there are the parents who get the protections of -- of the termination of rights provision and the parents who don't.  And I'm just wondering why if this statute creates two classes of parents it didn't say that in a more upfront kind of way.

Elena Kagan  So your argument is not that “ continued ” means something different from the normal language; your argument is that “ custody ” means something different from its normal language.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Kneedler, let's say you're right that this man is a parent under the terms of the Act, so not just a biological father but also he has a legal status as parent under this Act.  And then 1912 says, well, this is how you go about terminating parental rights, right?  But then your argument suggests that one of these clauses applies to him and the other one doesn't, even though he's a parent.  But you're saying he only gets some of the protections, that there are really two classes of parents, custodial parents and non.  So where does that come from?   Elena Kagan  But as a Federal overlay, Mr. Kneedler, I mean, does it make sense to sort of split apart (d) and (f) in this way?  Because (d) is the curing provision that says you have to take steps to try to cure this parent and, you know, to try to make him or her a better parent.  And then (f) says here's the standard for terminating parental rights if those curative efforts have failed.  Right?

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Weinberger, can I just understand what you're saying, and maybe do it through a hypothetical.   Elena Kagan  Suppose you had a -- a lawsuit and the generic sends the brand name manufacturer an e-mail and the e-mail says, we have this lawsuit, I think I have about a 50 percent chance of winning.  If I win, I take your -- your monopoly profits down from 100 million to $10 million.  Wouldn't it be a good thing if you just gave me 25 million?  All right?  And then the brand name sends an e-mail back, says -- you know, that seems like a pretty good idea, so I'll give you 25 million.  Now, as I understand it, your argument is, I mean, that's just fine.  That's hunky dory.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that fine?   Elena Kagan  Even though -- but what if it isn't in good faith?  It's clear what's going on here is that they're splitting monopoly profits and the person who's going to be injured are all the consumers out there.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Weinberger, I think if we give you the rule that you're suggesting we give you, that is going to be the outcome, because this is going to be the incentive of both the generic and the brand name manufacturer in every single case is to split monopoly profits in this way to the detriment of all consumers.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I don't think that that's true, Mr. Weinberger, and it's because of something that Justice Scalia suggested, that there's a kind of glitch in Hatch-Waxman, and the glitch is that the 180 days goes to the first filer.  And once the 180-day first filer is bought off, nobody else has the incentive to do this.   Elena Kagan  But the -- the huge percentage of the profits is done in the exclusivity period.  I mean, it's true that it can go on for a long time, but you're making dribs and drabs of money for a long time.  Where you're really making your money is in the 180 days.   Elena Kagan  But it's just an economic--   Elena Kagan  --I'm sorry, go ahead.   Elena Kagan  Could I just make sure I understand the way the 180-day period worked?  The first filer gets it, if I buy off -- if I'm a brand name manufacturer and I buy off the first filer with one of these reverse payments, you're suggesting that that's not going to do me much good because they're all going to be -- there's going to be a long line.  And that long line of people, it's not just that they don't get the 180-day period, it's like even if one of those people wins, the person whom I've paid off is going to get the 180-day exclusivity period; isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  But if it's not waived by the parties, in other words, it's just like I don't get it so my incentives go down.  It's that my competitor gets it.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement--   Elena Kagan  --Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry, please.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Then let me ask you my question.   Elena Kagan  Do you agree -- I mean, you said we should look to the way this is designed, so let's look to the way that the actual formula is designed.  Do you agree that this tax would impose identical tax liability for companies with -- at the same average profits but could impose very different tax liability for companies with the same total profits?  That's the way the thing is designed, is it not?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's the question.  Is that true of every excess profits tax?  Take a -- a hypothetical like this: You have two companies, Company A and Company B, and one company operates over four years and makes a lot of money and one company operates over one year and makes only a quarter of that amount of money.  Now, a typical excess profits tax is going to take Company A, which has made a lot of money, and -- and it's going to end up paying four times as much tax as Company B, which has made only a quarter of the amount of money.  But under this tax, Company A and Company B pay the exact same thing; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  One year or four years?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  In other words, a company that has made four times as much profits under this formula could pay the same tax; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because it was operating four times as long.   Elena Kagan  And because there is that D variable.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Assuming the floatation value is the same for both companies.   Elena Kagan  It definitely could.  It would have to.  And that's because what this is trying to tax is not total profits; this is trying to tax average profits or what may be the better way to say it, if it's taxing profitability and not profits.   Elena Kagan  But -- but the reason why this formula was devised in the way that this formula was devised was specifically to get at the outlier.  In other words, it was to get at the company that only operated for a short amount of time, but they wanted that company to pay just as big a tax bill as the company that had operated for a much longer amount of time and had made many more profits.  So the end result is that this company that operates for a very short amount of time and makes almost no excess profits pays the exact same tax bill as a company with four times as much excess profits.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but even companies with the exact same profits and the exact same floatation value can be subject to different taxes, and that's a result of the amount of time.  That's a result of the D variable.  If you were right--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --Excuse me.  If you were right, the D variable wouldn't exist.  If this were an excess profits tax, it would have been written without a D variable because they would not have cared whether it was four years or one year or any place in between.   Elena Kagan  If you were right, it would just be a 52 percent tax on annual profits above 1/9th of the floatation value.  And it's not that.  It's not that.  Specifically in order to get at railroad track, which would have paid very little tax under your formula, but instead pays a great amount of tax because they think that railroad track got the same good deal at the beginning as all these other companies did, but so even though they didn't make much very much in the way of excess profits, they were going to tax them just as much.

The Chief Justice is, of course, right, the amicus brief is the amicus brief and the amicus brief develops this argument, which I think is the right argument.  But you're not saying that's wrong.   Elena Kagan  Because they're saying this is not an income for anybody because, in fact, this doesn't tax anybody's income.  It taxes annual -- excuse me -- it taxes average profits, not total profits.  It taxes profitability as a mechanism to tax value.   Elena Kagan  Well, now I'm totally confused, because this outlier is an outlier not because the tax hasn't worked.  It's an out -- it's an outlier that the tax is designed to get at, that this formula was developed with this D variable in order to make sure that outliers, meaning people, companies that operated for only a short amount of time would still pay a significant tax bill.  So the whole design of this tax was to get at the outlier.  That seems to me to suggest that the predominant character of the tax is not an income tax but is instead a value tax.

And -- and it wasn't a gift that I was getting a free ticket, it was because I did something, I flew a certain number of miles.  So that there was an exchange with value on both sides.   Elena Kagan  I just don't see why that would make sense.  Because if I knew that it was really up to you to give me the free ticket, maybe I was willing to get it and maybe I wasn't.  I don't think that I'd be spending all this time in the air on your planes.  You know, I'd find another company that actually gave me the free ticket.   Elena Kagan  But usually what we say when a contract has no consideration, we don't say, oh, we're going to hold you to it anyway because the market will solve it.  We say the contract has no consideration, it's illusory, in just the way that Justice Ginsburg pointed out.  And the question is: If there's really no obligation on the part of the airline here to give that free ticket, if they can do it when they feel like it and not do it when they don't feel like it, why is there any consideration?  Why isn't the contract not illusory?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Clement, suppose that this complaint only had one count.  And suppose that they had said: Look, we have this contract and it gives very substantial discretion, it gives -- you know, by the words alone, it gives absolute discretion to Northwest, but that can't really be right because contracts have this implied covenant of good faith.  There's an implied duty to perform in good faith.  And that means that this discretion is narrowed in certain kinds of ways, that they can't terminate my membership for certain kinds of reasons.  And that's all the complaint said.  There was just this one count.  Do you think that would be preempted?   Elena Kagan  I guess what I'm suggesting is that the implied covenant here, it's just an interpretive tool.  It says that there are certain kinds of provisions that are written very broadly or very vaguely, and an implied covenant comes in to help us interpret those kinds of provisions.  And viewed in that way, it's just a contractual device that in light of Wolens ought to be permitted.   ",12-462X

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That would be weird, isn't it, because in such a State, there might be a contract where the parties reasonably did expect this implicit term that limits something, a very broad conferral of discretion to operate.

Because as I sort of survey the universe, it seems as though whatever the standard is, the standard is the same for both, and there's no statute in which the two have been divorced.  Am I wrong about that?   Elena Kagan  I'll try again.  Is there any other statute in which we have a different standard of causation for a retaliation claim than we do for a substantive discrimination claim?   Elena Kagan  Well, is there -- I mean, it's but-for everywhere.  Is there even any time at which whatever the standard that applied, you know, pre-Gross, is there ever a moment and is there ever a statute in the history of antidiscrimination laws where there has been a divorce, a different standard for retaliation than for substantive discrimination?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  All I'm saying, you know, Gross was a couple of years ago.  It said but-for covers the -- the ABA and outside Title VII.  You know, we've had a lot of discrimination statutes since 1964.  We've had a lot of different standards applying to those discrimination statutes since 1964.  And you're coming in here and asking for the first time in all of those many decades that we should divorce the retaliation claim from the substantive discrimination claim and make them follow two different standards; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Joseffer, I mean, Title VII is written before any of these cases come along.  So Title VII is written and it says we have an anti -- you know, a substantive antidiscrimination provision, and we have a retaliation provision.  And then the Court starts issuing cases.  And it says, by the way, you actually don't need both.  One will do the job for you, because one includes the other.  And that's in Sullivan.  And that's in Jackson.  And that's in Gomez-Perez, and I'm sure I am missing a few.  Three, four, five times, the Court says this.  So then in 1991 Congress comes back and it says, we want to make some amendments, what do we have to do?  Do we have to amend both, the anti -- the substantive provision and the retaliation provision?  Well, no, we have been told five times that as long as we say one it means both.  And so that's what Congress does in 1991.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but, Mr. Joseffer, in CBOCS, we said that because of Sullivan alone, just because of Sullivan, there was no need for Congress to exclude explicit language about retaliation.  In other words, we -- we said Sullivan made the point clear.  Now, Justice Alito was right.  After that, it goes on.  We have done it many more times after 1991.  But we have said that Sullivan itself made the point clear that you did not need explicit language about retaliation.   Elena Kagan  I mean, here's what you're ask -- this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question -- but here's what you're asking us to accept, Mr. Joseffer.  Congress comes along in 1991 in a world in which there has -- there have never been separate standards for retaliation and substantive discrimination.  Congress is trying to codify and make even stronger the Price Waterhouse decision, right?  They -- you know, they say, basically, we like Price Waterhouse, but it's kind of confused and the court was kind of fractured.  We're going to really put it into place legislatively.  They do that, they follow the -- essentially the drafting manuals that we have given them in Sullivan.  And you're saying, well, no.  What they really meant was that retaliation would have a different standard and, indeed, retaliation would have a standard that the dissenting justices suggested in Price Waterhouse, notwithstanding what Congress was clearly intending to do was codify the majority -- the plurality-plus position.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Gross is talking about outside of Title VII.  And -- and whatever might be said of Gross outside of Title VII, here, where Congress is specifically trying to make Title VII conform with Price Waterhouse, with the backdrop of our legislative drafting instructions, and with the backdrop of never distinguishing between retaliation and antidiscrimination, you know, how do you get to where you want to be?

Because I thought that the purpose -- that the whole point of the C&L Enterprises case is to say that when a tribe agrees to arbitration, it has waived its sovereign immunity for that purpose in that proceeding.  Are you saying that there was something special in this agreement?

So what -- I guess what's -- what's -- what's the case that would suggest that when the plaintiff shifts the sovereign immunity is -- goes away?   Elena Kagan  General, if -- if I could assume that this is not Indian lands and just ask why you need for sovereign immunity to go away?  So you have the ability to arrest people.  You have the ability to bring Ex Parte Young actions.  Presumably, you have the ability on non-Indian lands simply to shut down a casino.  Presumably, you have the ability on non-Indian lands to condition any licensing of the casino on whatever you want.  I guess the question is: On non-Indian lands, you have a thousand ways to stop a casino that you don't want.  Why do you need the abrogation of sovereign immunity?   Elena Kagan  Well, I think that all of our cases suggest that sovereign immunity is quite important to a sovereign's dignity and that it's not nothing to abrogate sovereign immunity.  And so you can say, well, you know, that would be less intrusive than all these other things, bringing Ex Parte Young suits, arresting people, just, you know, conditioning the -- a license, stopping the casino from operating.

There are really only five very contested Senate races, and 100 PACs say that they're going to support those five candidates.  So a donor gives $5,000 to each of those 100 PACs which support those candidates, the PAC divides up the money, $1,000 goes to each candidate.  The total, all those PACs, $100,000 goes to each of the -- of the Senate candidates in the five most contested races, 20 times what the individual contribution limits allow.

And anybody can contribute $2600 to each of these candidates, 150 of them, right?  So that makes about $400,000.  And then these 150 candidates with completely safe seats just transfer all this money to the one person who doesn't have a safe seat.  So that's about $400,000.  Double it for a primary and a general election, that's about $800,000 that all goes to one candidate from one donor because of the ability for candidates to transfer money to each other.

So take your 30 or 40 House contested seats and it becomes a conduit for a single person to make an $800,000 contribution to a candidate in a contested district.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Burchfield, if you take off the aggregate limits, people will be allowed, if you put together the national committees and all the State committees and all the candidates in the House and the Senate, it comes to over $3.5 million.  So I can write checks totalling $3.5 million to the Republican Party committees and all its candidates or to the Democratic Party committees and all its committees even before I start writing checks to independent PACs.  Now, having written a check for 3.5 or so million dollars to a single party's candidates, are you suggesting that that party and the members of that party are not going to owe me anything, that I won't get any special treatment?  Because I thought that that was exactly what we said in McConnell, that when we talked about soft money restrictions, we understood that you give $3.5 million, you get a very, very special place at the table.  So this is effectively to -- to reintroduce the soft money scheme of McConnell, isn't it?     No.  No, Your Honor, it is absolutely not, because McConnell dealt with the situations where there were -- you were not considering the base limits.  The soft money by definition was not subject to the base limits.  To take your example of the joint fundraising committee, the joint fundraising regulation, which consumes more than three pages in the -- in the Federal Code of Federal Regulations -- it's at 102.17(c) -- it specifically reaffirms the base limits.  It specifically reaffirms the anti-earmarking restriction, and it says that the joint fundraising committee must inform all contributors of those restrictions.  So, again, it's the situation where the money leaves the contributor's hands, he loses control over it, and the person who receives it makes the direction.   Elena Kagan  But the money -- the money goes to a single party.  And indeed, I could make this even worse.  I could say, let's say the Speaker of the House or the Majority Leader of the House solicits this money from particular people.  So solicits somebody to ante up his $3.6 million.  And then, you know, Justice Kennedy said in McConnell the making of a solicited gift is a quid both to the recipient of the money and to the one who solicits the payment.  So the Speaker, the Majority Leader, can solicit $3.6 million to all the party members and you're telling me there's just no special influence that goes along with that?     Well, we know from the Citizens United decision, Your Honor, that gratitude and influence are not considered to be quid pro quo corruption.  So I think that's what you're talking about.  That is not the sort of corruption that would sustain this limit, especially in light of the severe restrictions on speech and association that it imposes as the political parties compete against each other and as they -- and as -- as the candidates have to compete against each other.  Justice Alito.   ",12-536X

1,"Elena Kagan  You -- you suggested, General, that the -- the fact that this is statutory makes your position easier.   Elena Kagan  And I wonder if that's true.  I mean, you could see an -- an argument the exact other way, which suggests that we all understand that common law changes and evolves over time, but that it's rare for a court to reverse a decision on what a statute means, and that that's not foreseeable in the same way.  So -- now, especially if it were a single court saying the statute means A today, and then tomorrow it comes back and it says, no, it means B, whether that isn't actually -- whether that wouldn't cut against your position.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, General, I guess I wonder whether it's relevant what the statute really says as opposed to what courts said it says.  I mean, sometimes judges make errors and our law is dotted with places where courts have made errors and said that things mean what they don't mean or don't mean what they do mean, and, you know, we expect people to follow what the court says is the law even if there's really a better reading out there.  And also, we think that people should rely on what the court says is the law, even though there's really a better reading out there.  And so, you know, what does it matter if we come out and said -- and say, you know, what were these crazy Michigan courts doing?  If that's what they were doing, it seems as though people had a right to rely on that.   Elena Kagan  But was there anyone prior to 2001 who couldn't raise a defense like this, who was precluded from doing so because a court thought, oh, you know, the -- the statute really clears the field, and -- and this defense is not available?  Was it -- can you point to anything?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess they can point to just a lot of people who were raising this defense.   Elena Kagan  This is -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Do you have something like in the middle?  [Laughter]   Elena Kagan  And if you were a prosecutor, you would not have objected to that defense, would you have?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you have any--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --have any reason to think that any prosecutor ever objected to such a defense?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Just to go back to Justice Breyer's question.  I mean, there may be no way you can answer this, but are we talking about, you know, do five people a year -- did five people a year raise this or -- or 20 or 100?  I mean, what kind of numbers?   Elena Kagan  Right.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You can't really tell because nobody was objecting to anything--   Elena Kagan  --right?   ",12-547X

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Garre, it seems as though you and the Government agree on sort of the nature of this problem, right?  Which is you have a partnership item, which is the sham determination.  That leads to an adjustment in outside basis which, as you just said, is not a partnership item, is instead an affected item; and that leads to a penalty, right?  So there's kind of three things, two steps in the process.  And you say, well, that's not enough, essentially because the penalty has to directly relate to a partnership item.  And they say it is enough because it's okay if it indirectly relates to the partnership item.  And I guess the question is: In some sense you're both adding adjectives to the statute.  You add directly, they add indirectly.  How do we pick between those?   Elena Kagan  And in that sense, Mr. Garre, it strikes me as wrong to say the words in dispute are “ partnership item ”.  Actually, everybody agrees what  ""partnership item: Means, what it includes, and what it doesn't include. ""  ""It doesn't include outside basis. ""  ""The government is perfectly happy to concede that. ""  It seems as though the words in dispute are what does “ relate to ” mean and does “ relate to ” have to be “ relate to ” in this very direct way that excludes this intermediate step of adjusting outside basis.   Elena Kagan  But I think that--   Elena Kagan  --Well, that was the prototypical case, Mr. Garre.  There's no question that that's the central case that -- that Congress had in mind.  But it doesn't have to be the only case.  And they wrote words that seem to be applicable to this case as well as to the kind of case that you're talking about.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  You're saying they have text, and you have a bunch of other things.  [Laughter]   ",12-562X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, what does it mean -- what does it mean in the context of an intentional tort, which is what we're talking about here, to aim at a particular State, if it doesn't mean to aim at a person who you know to be within that State?  I mean, nobody conducts an intentional tort intending to injure California per se.  You're intending to injure a person who resides in California.  So what would it actually mean to aim conduct at a State irrespective of a person?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, suppose -- suppose -- and I'm sorry.  Please.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  I guess I just -- the -- the McIntyre example is a very different kind of example because in those cases, you really are talking about a company seeking to serve a general market in a State.  But intentional tort cases don't usually have that quality.  You're going after a particular person in an intentional tort case.  And it's odd to think of going after an intentional -- a particular person, whether it's a defamation suit or it's a fraud suit or -- or what have you, as -- as targeting the State itself.   Elena Kagan  Would you -- would your answer be different, suppose that the officer had said, you can keep -- you can keep your money, go on to Nevada with it, and then, once the Fiores had reached Nevada the officer said -- the officer filed a false affidavit, which, let's say, froze the Fiores' bank accounts.  Would your -- would your answer be different?  The affidavit was filed in Georgia, but the money was not seized in Georgia, instead, the money has gone on to Nevada.  Is there personal jurisdiction in Nevada?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, he did it by filing an affidavit in Georgia and then it froze a bank account.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Sherry, just to try to figure out how far your argument goes, suppose there's an IRS agent sitting in Washington, D.C., and she maliciously does something, files an affidavit, does whatever she does to impose a tax penalty on somebody in Nevada and everything that she does happens in Washington, D.C.--  Does the person in Nevada, who is the victim of this malicious attempt to impose a tax penalty, have to go to Washington, D.C. to sue her?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, she's a very mobile person.  She lives in Nevada, but she goes other places, and -- and this could, you know, harm her wherever she goes.  Isn't that what you said?  So why should she be able to bring suit in Nevada under your view?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  So there'd be a difference if the bag had been shipped to Washington, D.C.?  And, you know, money is -- is fungible.  Money is everywhere and nowhere.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah, they seize it and then there's a false affidavit keeping it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And the complaint is only about the false affidavit, but it's in reference to property that is indisputably in Georgia.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Goldstein, as I understood what Mr. Bucholtz was saying, he was saying there is a distinction between an officer who commits a fraud in Georgia, when your money is in Nevada, and so he commits a fraud and he freezes your bank accounts in Nevada, versus he commits a fraud by filing this affidavit.  But it is as to money that is located where he is, not where you are, but where he is in Georgia.  That's the distinction that I understood him to be drawing.

1,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Saharsky--   Elena Kagan  --I'm wondering whether you way overread the cases that you rely on, because in all of those cases what we were talking about was an examination that had specifically requested by the defendant.  Now, here that's not the case.  The Defendant has asked for something and has opened the door conceivably.  But the examination that we're talking about is one that the State has compelled and that the Defendant does not wish to undergo.  That's a big difference between this case and all the ones you rely on.   Elena Kagan  Not to belabor this, but the -- the holding of the case is that the prosecution may rebut this presentation with evidence from the reports of the examination that the defendant's requested.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean -- I guess the question is that you say it's a factual difference; it might be a factual difference between compulsion and lack of compulsion.   Elena Kagan  So is that a waiver theory?  Because Justice Scalia's opinion was not based on a waiver theory.  But my understanding of your brief was that you were arguing about waiver, is that right; that the -- the Defendant here has waived the ability to say that he's being compelled?   ",12-609X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, but if that's policy, why isn't the -- the cross-examination analogy policy as well?  I mean, they are both based on some notion of what is parity and what's reciprocity and what's -- you know, what's appropriate to ask the defendant to bear once the defendant decides to become a witness in a proceeding.  So they are both the same kind of policy.  You want to call it that, but it's -- it's -- one is no more policy than the other.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal, could I go back to the cross-examination analogy.  Because you say your case is different, but I think you'll have to explain that one to me.  It seems to me that the cross-examination cases say you can't become a witness halfway.  Once you've decided to become a witness, you have to subject yourself to all the things that every other witness is subjected to.  And it seems to me that you haven't convinced me that the same point isn't true here, that the person, Mr. Cheever, has decided to become a witness essentially by giving an interview to his own expert and allowing his own expert to speak about what Mr. Cheever has told him.  And so, you know, he can't do it halfway.  Now the government has to get its shot.  Same way.   INTERRUPTING ",12-609X
1,"Elena Kagan  But isn't the important point, Mr. Kinnaird, that there's a presumption of correctness that attaches to guidelines sentences on appeal--   Elena Kagan  --that does not attach to non-guidelines sentences?   Elena Kagan  I mean, this is, one would think, great legal consequence.   Elena Kagan  I think I'm saying more than it's all in your head.  I think I'm saying you start in a particular place, you have to get the particular place right.  The appellate court looks at the particular place that you've started and if you -- if you've ended up there, has to grant a presumption of reasonableness.  But the rules are all geared towards saying, yes, you can deviate, but you have to understand that there's -- that -- deviation requires some kind of thought process and some kind of reason.  Otherwise, this is where you should be.     Eric J. Feigin  --If you look at fraud and you look at child pornography, they deviate when they go in -- when the guidelines' suggestion goes up, the sentences don't go up in accordance with that at the same level of the chart you are looking at.  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.   ",12-62XX
0,"Elena Kagan  But what that suggests is that the guidelines serve as an anchor and are supposed to serve as an anchor, and that the reason why the miscalculation is error is because you've picked the wrong anchor and that's going to affect or -- or has a significant likelihood of affecting your ultimate decision.  And isn't that really what we've suggested is the way the guidelines ought to work, and the way you think the guidelines ought to work, that it serves as an anchor for sentencing decisions.  Yes, you can vary, you can deviate, but it's your anchor.     Elena Kagan  Mr. Feigin, you're sounding awfully like according deference to the guidelines counts as reversible error.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But surely, you do not want judges living in a world where they think that they cannot give deference to the guidelines; isn't that right?  You want them to give appropriate deference to the guidelines; isn't that correct?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Feigin, take this example.  Let's suppose that there's a crime and the punishment for crime is 5 years to life, all right?  Now, Congress passes a statute and it says, no, we think this crime now is much more important than we used to, now it's 25 years to life, right?  A -- a person commits the offense prior to that change.  Absolutely obvious case, right, that you have to apply the -- the 5 years to life, right?  Obvious, correct?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Now, the Sentencing Commission does what the Sentencing Commission always does when there is a legislative change like this.  It says, well, we have this guidelines that assumes 5 years to life.  We have to change our guidelines because now it's 25 years to life.  And it passes a guideline amendment which completely conforms to the legislative amendment.  But you're saying, no, the 25-year-to-life guideline is the appropriate one to implement, even though the 5-year statute is the appropriate one to implement -- is the appropriate one to give effect to.  Can that possibly be right?   Elena Kagan  I think more goes into it than empirics.  But there's this unbelievable chart really in one of the green briefs about -- you know, where there's one line which is what happens to the guidelines and there's this other line which is what happens to the sentence, and they follow each other identically, exactly.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That would be inconsistent with the accept and use language, isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you have done something to the Federal form, and that essentially creates a new set of requirements and a new form.   Elena Kagan  Do you -- do you think that you could have said, you know, we have our own State form which we're allowed to have under the statute.  Anybody who requires the Federal form has to append the State form as well.  Could you have done that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, how do we draw the line?  Where does the line get drawn between adding just your own form, and adding a new set of requirements, which, you know, you could just as easily have called a form?   Elena Kagan  But -- but, General, doesn't the -- the statute make the EAC the decisionmaker with respect to what can be added to the Federal form?  The Federal form -- form, you're exactly right, sets a floor.  But if you look at Section 7, what Section 7 does is to say the EAC gets to decide the minimum necessary and it consults with the States and the States can come to it and tell it what it needs and the EAC can take action.  But the EAC is driving the bus, according to Section 7 of this statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm a little bit confused.   Elena Kagan  General, could I take you back to this distinction that you're making.

So it seems just a little bit like a solution in search of a problem.   Elena Kagan  What evidence do you have that any bad incentives -- you know, any bad effects are actually flowing from this?  There's actually a big leeway in this statute, because it's 3 years.  The administrative review process only takes about a year.  Even if this is a -- it's a complicated case where there's some tolling, you know, maybe it gets you up to another year; you still have a year.  I mean, what -- how would people behave badly or behave in ways that you think would disrupt the statutory scheme, if we just let everything stay as it is?

It doesn't give people very long after the 12 or 13 months of the administrative review process is over.  What should a court do then?  Should a court strike the entire statute?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  Should the court say, that's unreasonable, that goes too far?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  You know what?  Take it out of the statute context.  Just say that the contract said 18 months rather -- so -- so that's really what I meant.  What is -- what's a court to do with a contract that says that?   Elena Kagan  Well, but in 18 months.  And so 18 -- the administrative review process takes about 12 months in most cases.   Elena Kagan  Is 18 months enough?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, what's the rule of law -- what's the rule of law that allows to get rid of a contract provision that's set at 14 months or 15 months or 16 months and to leave this one?

But even if a contract does not have an exhaustion requirement, courts have required exhaustion.   Elena Kagan  And courts have required it even though the statute doesn't say so.   Elena Kagan  It's an extra-textual requirement the courts have made up, irrespective of what the contract provides.   Elena Kagan  I think what Justice Breyer was suggesting, that maybe, given that we have this sort of judge-made rule of exhaustion, that the courts just did sort of a half job of it, that they also should have put the statute of limitations that makes that exhaustion requirement work, and that ensures that it doesn't produce unfair, bad outcomes.   Elena Kagan  The Congress was dealing -- you know, Congress passed ERISA before this exhaustion requirement came into play.  So it's a little bit hard to read into anything, to read Congress's silence in the normal way here, because Congress didn't think that there was going to be this exhaustion requirement--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --and the courts put it on later.

1,"Elena Kagan  And, Mr. Panner, if they did reach it a second time around and they decided well, now that this inducement theory is not available to us, we think that there is a real problem here, that there is a kind of end run around the patent law and so we're going to change what we think on the 271(a) question, if they did that, it would be right to say it would render our opinion on the 271(b) question a nullity?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  I guess the question I'm asking -- I mean, I can't think of a way in which our decision on the 271(b) question would be relevant for any case if the Federal Circuit on remand goes the opposite way in a -- on the 271(a) question.  But maybe I'm not thinking more broadly enough.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  I suppose I just couldn't think of a place where somebody would make the 271(b) claim if the 271(a) claim were available to it.   Elena Kagan  But I suppose, Mr. Panner, what might make this a little bit different is that notwithstanding what you said about 10 of 11 judges, it was clear that the judges thought that there was a real problem here in terms of an end run, and that they looked at this and said, well we could do it under 271(a) or we could do it under 271(b), and 271(b) seems a lot more natural and better for various reasons.  But your sense in reading the opinion that all those judges who did it under 271(b) are just going to go back and do the exact same thing under 271(a).   Elena Kagan  But in some ways that's why the Federal Circuit did what it did, right?  I mean, you can look at the Federal Circuit's ruling and say it makes no sense.  How can you induce infringement if there's no infringement in the first place.  And that's a very strong argument.  But the reason they put this under 271(b) rather than under 271(a) is because of what Justice Scalia said, that 271(b) is not a strict liability offense, and so that you can say, you have to know and you have to have instructed the -- the person.  So, you know, they thought that they were being very clever by putting it into a 271(b) box and avoiding the strict liability consequences of what they were doing, but also avoiding the possibility of an end run of the patent law.     I think that's right.  I think another reason the Federal Circuit might not want--   Elena Kagan  There is that problem.  There is -- There is that problem.  [Laughter]     --Right.  I think the problem under 271(a) for the Federal Circuit was that well-established tort doctrines don't support attribution liability when you have a vendor customer.  So it turned to 271(b).  The problem with 271(b), as Justice Scalia said, is that it's very clear from the text of the statute that the conduct induced has to be direct infringement.  And I think the Court has twice before confronted situations where there was conduct that clearly was intended to circumvent the Patent Act.  In both Microsoft v. AT&T and Deepsouth, it was very clear that what -- what the defendant was trying to do was ship operations overseas so that it could avoid the Patent Act.  And in both of those cases, the Court reversed lower court decisions that had used that desire to stop circumvention as the primary driver of its interpretation of the Act.  So in both cases, the Court said, to be liable under 271, you have to satisfy the requirements of 271.  We are not going to interpret the text simply to avoid circumvention concerns, even when, you know, you would say, if you were looking from the perspective of the patentee, that essentially their -- their patent had been performed.  In both cases, the Court said it is for Congress to make that judgment because there will always be countervailing policy concerns.  And I think--   ",12-786X

Limelight did not brief this until you briefed it, so we have part of Limelight's reply brief.  None of the amicus knew -- the amici knew that it was in the case until you briefed the 271 issue.  So that would seem a real problem in getting to the 271 issue here.   Elena Kagan  That--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Waxman, I think it's a very different situation.  I mean, in that case it's clear that there was a kidnapping.  It happened to be a kidnapping done by four people rather than a kidnapping done by one person.  But there was a kidnapping.  Now, in your case, I don't think you can say the same thing because the question is: Is there an infringement?  Under Federal Circuit law, there is no infringement when different people do these different steps of the process.  That's just the fact of the matter.   Elena Kagan  But I think again, Mr. Waxman, what -- what -- what your argument just glides over is did you need the infringement.  And the question is whether, under substantive law, you have the infringement when different people do different steps of the process.  And as I understand the Federal Circuit's law in this area, it's that you don't have any infringement when different people do different steps of the process.

1,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Lenz, could I ask you about what you just said?  You said Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell; those are the three.  So Carter says the Fifth Amendment requires that a criminal trial judge must give a no-adverse-inference jury instruction when requested by a defendant.  And that was, of course, not a sentencing case.  Then Estelle says, we discern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of Respondent's capital murder trial so far as the protection of the Fifth Amendment; so a kind of general view that the Fifth Amendment applies equally in the two.  And then Mitchell holds -- it basically repeats that from Estelle and says, we must accord the privilege the same protection in the sentencing phase of any criminal case, as that which is due in the trial phase.  So when you put those together, Carter with Estelle, Mitchell, how -- why do you think that there's a gap?   Elena Kagan  But take the -- take the hypothetical, Ms. Lenz, that suppose, you know, the prosecutor had said you just heard testimony from our expert that -- the blood spattering expert, that the victim's suffering was especially prolonged, and look, the defendant didn't take the stand.  Why didn't he take the stand to deny that?  All right?  So could the prosecutor have said that at the sentencing hearing?   Elena Kagan  So you're suggesting that what we haven't decided, if you will, goes beyond the remorse question of -- that we -- that we talked about in -- not Mitchell, but -- is it Mitchell?   Elena Kagan  It goes beyond the remorse question.  And you're saying that really, in the sentencing hearing, the Fifth Amendment has nothing to do with -- with anything that happens there essentially, because once -- once the person has been found eligible for the death penalty, a prosecutor and a jury can -- can draw whatever inferences they want.   Elena Kagan  Well, where does that difference come from?  Because I thought that every time and in every circumstance that we've prohibited an adverse inference we've also required a requested jury instruction.  I don't know of a -- of a case or any principle that would suggest that we can tear those two things apart and say, well, look, an adverse inference is prohibited, but, no, you don't get an instruction.   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm asking a different question.  Do you have any case that suggests that those two things don't go hand and hand?  Because my -- my sort of reading of our case law is that they do.  Any time we've said an adverse inference is prohibited, we've also said the defendant is titled -- is entitled to an instruction about adverse inferences if he requests it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But in not making that distinction, I mean, it does speak very broadly, and it says, you know -- I'm reading another quotation from it.  ""The rule against negative inferences at a criminal trial apply with equal force at sentencing. ""  Now, it does have this exception for remorse or a possible exception for remorse.  But with that exception, otherwise, it says the rule against adverse inferences applies, doesn't it?   Elena Kagan  I think my question was just the breadth of these statements about everything that applies at trial with respect to adverse inferences also applies at the sentencing phase, with the possible exception of adverse inferences about remorse.  That's the way I read the cases.   ",12-794X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Estelle might not have been overruled, but there's a caveat that Mitchell puts in, and it's a caveat about remorse and that remorse might be different.  And the question is why doesn't that caveat suggest, at the very least, that the instruction that you asked for was so broad that it went beyond what this Court has decided.  Because the instruction that you asked for did not distinguish remorse from other issues that were going to come before the jury at the sentencing phase.  So at the very least it seems that instruction sort of blows by the question that we have reserved.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  So how was it an issue at the hearing?  Because that would seem to cut against you very strongly, Mr. Komp.  If remorse is an issue at the hearing, remorse is the very thing that in Mitchell we said we have not decided.  And then you have no clearly established law to rely on.  And I appreciate that this was before Mitchell rather than after Mitchell; but it suggests that there was always a question about whether Estelle applied to remorse.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Komp, did the Sixth Circuit apply the wrong harmlessness standard here?  It seemed to a apply the standard that would be applicable on direct review rather than on habeas review; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  Because it seems to rely primarily on Carter.  And Carter applies the Chapman standard, which is of course the direct review standard.   ",12-794X

Is that covered by the securities laws now?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, how is it removed from that?  Because it has the same structural features, which is it's a misrepresentation about what you're going to do with securities, but, in fact, does not affect any securities trading.  What it affects is a decision to do something else, here to buy CDs or in my example to go get married.

And here there's nothing to say.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Somebody, not necessarily the victim of the fraud, but somebody has to have had some transaction in the market.  It's the kind of misrepresentation that would affect someone in making transactions in the covered market.  How would this do that?   Elena Kagan  Ms. Goldenberg, suppose I think that the correct test is something along the lines of what Justice Breyer just said, is -- is this the kind of representation that could affect somebody?

You said, in response to Justice Alito, that sometimes concealment can be a factor in determining whether a child is settled.  And I presume you mean if somebody conceals the child by moving the child from place to place, the child would not be settled.  Is it also a factor in determining whether a settled child should nonetheless be returned?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Or under Article 18.   Elena Kagan  No, but prior to that.   Elena Kagan  If you could go back to -- do you agree with Justice Scalia, that really, at that point, there's nothing to do?  Once the determination has been made that the child is settled, there is no remaining discretion that the judge has?   Elena Kagan  Well, if that's the case, if you're reading it that way -- I mean, I was reading it Justice Scalia's way, too.   Elena Kagan  The first clause says shall and the second clause says shall not.  But there is an alternate reading where the first clause says shall and the second clause essentially says  ""may or may not at your discretion. ""  But, boy, that would open up a big discretionary hole if you read it that way, wouldn't it?   Elena Kagan  If I understand the way you think this works, you don't -- there's not even a presumption that a settled child will stay, right?

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Loy, can I ask you what you think this standing doctrine is all about in a context like this?  You said before, you said to give -- to effect Congress's intent in passing Section 43.  Is that what we're trying to do here?   Elena Kagan  Well, one of the questions.  Why isn't that the only question that we ought to be concerned with in a case like this?  Congress creates a right of action and it seems to me that the normal thing that we ought to do and do do in most contexts is just say, you know, What's the scope of that right of action?  And -- and certainly we could take into account Congress's purposes in interpreting the scope of that right of action.  But that would be the question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess, if that's the question the AGC test strikes me as not the answer to that question.  I mean, we don't usually say what was Congress's intent, how broad did Congress mean for this cause of action to go, and then sort of devise a five-part test with a lot of things that aren't mentioned in the statute.   Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Loy, you said there's universal recognition that there should be prudential standing requirements in the Lanham Act.  When should there be prudential standing requirements in a statutory right of action?  In other words, Congress passes lots of statutory rights of action.  And let's say that almost never, never does Congress talk about prudential standing one way or the other.  Do you think that every time Congress passes a right of action, the courts are supposed to engage in a kind of free-form inquiry about what kind of prudential standing rule should apply to that particular right of action?   Elena Kagan  And -- and you just sort of know them when you see them or it's a reaction to what are perceived to be very broad statutes or, you know, when -- when do we know that we should be offered a prudential standing jag?   Elena Kagan  But there, couldn't that be done just by interpreting the -- the language of the statue in accord with its purposes, because you have a specific purpose provision in the Lanham Act that says we're -- we're trying to get at commercial competition here.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Jones, is the question that you are asking us to ask just, did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to sue?  Is that the question that you think we ought to be asking?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Let's not call the limits anything in particular.  The question in your view is Congress passes this Act; did Congress -- including this right of action.  Did Congress want this kind of actor to be able to use that right of action?  Is that correct?   Elena Kagan  But if that's correct, I mean, rather than talking about whether something is arguably within the zone of interests in the way we have to do in the APA context, because we are dealing with a lot of statutes that don't provide rights of action there, why shouldn't we just ask, what kinds of actors did the Lanham Act provide a right of action to as sensibly construed?  We should sensibly construe the Lanham Act in accordance with Congress's purposes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And then what would be the test?  What would we say the Lanham Act means?   Elena Kagan  What I think, Mr. Jones, just a couple of years ago we made clear that ‶ arguably ″ was to be taken very seriously, and essentially established a kind of buffer zone so that if you kind -- we weren't going to be too strict about it.  And the reason we did that, again, is because the way the APA works is it's on top of a lot of Federal statutes that have no rights of action themselves.  So there is nothing for us to interpret in those Federal statutes.  And we say, well, if you arguably come within the scope of that statute, then you are aggrieved for purposes of the APA.  But this is a very different situation.  This is a situation where we have a particular right of action.  And rather than create any kind of buffer zone around it, we should just ask how is it sensible to interpret that right of action?   ",12-873X

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Bash, what about this case?  Suppose that there are two guys and they are talking about committing a crime, and they have the same kind of conversation that Justice Alito was referencing, you know, one guy says I want to bring a gun, the other says, no, I think that's a really bad idea.  But this time, the guy says: Okay, you've convinced me, it's a bad idea to bring a gun, I won't bring a gun.  And so then they go out and they rob whatever they are robbing, and in the middle of it, you know -- or they do a drug transaction, and in the middle of that drug transaction the guy who said don't bring a gun looks over and he realizes that, notwithstanding the promise, his confederate did bring a gun.  But there they are, they are in the middle of their drug transaction.  So the guy, you know, they're right -- they are handing the money to each other and the guy keeps on doing it, all right?  Is -- is that enough, even though, you know, there's foreknowledge, there's acts after he -- he realizes that the guy has a gun?  Is that sufficient?   Elena Kagan  Well, what exactly would you want him to do at that point to not be convicted of this, of this offense?  Would you want him to just say, you know, sort of like drop everything, I'm out of there?  Is that the idea?   Elena Kagan  Right.  I mean, I guess that's the question: Is there always a reasonable opportunity to withdraw after you see that there's a gun in the offense that you didn't expect to be there?  And do you think that there has to be a reasonable opportunity to withdraw, or would you say, no, everybody has a reasonable opportunity to withdraw all the time; you can just leave?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Bash, you know, what sticks in my craw a little bit about your position is this: Usually, we want punishments to -- two people and they do very different things and they have very different intents, we want them actually to be punished differently.  And what you're suggesting is that there is -- let's say a crime, two people are involved in it.  One person does almost everything.  You know, he does 90 percent of the stuff.  And the other person does just a little thing, but something, you know, that goes to the offense that helps facilitate the offense.  But it's really pretty small compared to the overall crime.  And then in addition to that, that person does not have really full-fledged intent, just has a kind of knowledge that this other person with real purpose of intent is going to bring a gun.  So -- so, you have a lesser act and a lesser intent, and notwithstanding that, you're saying that the person ought to be punished in the exact same way as his confederate.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I just add, what I would have thought was that the actus reus can be very small, but almost to compensate for that, you have to have full-fledged intent.  You have to have a really kind of purpose of -- a -- a purpose that the crime succeed as opposed to just knowledge of -- of what will happen.   ",12-895X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Hastings, Section 1391 says the following,  ""Except as otherwise provided by law. ""  --not by contract --  ""by law, this section shall govern -- shall govern -- the venue of all -- all civil actions brought in district courts of the United States. ""  And then it goes on to specify certain rules for where venue in a case can lie.  So if I'm looking at that, I'm thinking, well, those rules apply.  And they can't be reversed or countermanded or whatever by -- by contract, by parties' agreement except to the extent that the contract can figure centrally into the 1404 analysis.  But it's not appropriate in the 1406 analysis because, you know, the statute says what the statute says.  Here is venue.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Hastings, I wonder what you think of this analogy: Any party can waive a personal jurisdiction defense, but would you say that parties by contract can create personal jurisdiction in a court in which it otherwise doesn't exist?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, as I said, anybody can waive it.  Just like anybody can waive almost everything in our -- in -- in the way the Federal rules work.  But do you think that parties can actually create personal jurisdiction where it doesn't exist by law?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Hastings, has 12(b)(6) ever been used to your knowledge to deal with a case in which the question is which court the plaintiff should have brought the suit in, rather than whether the plaintiff has a viable claim in any court?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because it seems to me a bit of a category error.  The 12(b)(6) is something -- it's an on-the-merits determination about the viability of your claim.  It has res judicata effect, whereas this is not.  This is just a question of, did you bring the thing in the right place and you should be allowed to bring it someplace else.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, I know the courts have.  I'm saying, except for this kind of case, has a court ever used 12(b)(6) to deal with a case of which court?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Or to deal with anything that's not an on-the-merits determination that precludes a case in any court?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think you mistook my point at least.  Maybe I didn't express it clearly.  Bremen comes up on a forum non conveniens motion, and the Court says, yes, the contract controls, quite properly so.  So, you know, the fact that it comes up on a forum non conveniens motion has nothing to do with the question of whether the contract controls where, if it negotiated for a certain set of things and there is no exceptional public interest otherwise.   Elena Kagan  Can I ask you one last question about 12(b)(6)?   Elena Kagan  Which is, you know, when 1404 is -- suppose a state which does not recognize these clauses, 1404 trumps that according to Stewart.  But if you were under 12(b)(6), you would have to go to what Justice Scalia does in the Stewart dissent.  I think you would have to go to a twin aims of Erie analysis.  And in that circumstance, it seems to me that the state law would come out the victor; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING ",12-929X
0,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Allensworth, where you agreed not to bring it.   Elena Kagan  So I'm going back to what Justice Breyer says.  Let's suppose you're right about 1404, and I think you have some pretty good arguments.  1404, it seems to me, shouldn't affect this case in the sense that you should have -- this was a negotiated contract.  You got something for the fact that you accepted inconvenience when you brought a suit.  And under 1404, the court is perfectly entitled -- the court has to take that into account, that this was a negotiated contract, that you accepted in convenience, and that you got something for your -- for your acceptance of inconvenience.  The end.  You have to live with your contract.   Elena Kagan  Well, it does in this way.   Elena Kagan  It does in this way.  1404, as Justice Ginsburg said, is a codification of forum non conveniens law, which is a balancing of private and public interests.  It seems to me what Justice Alito said was absolutely right.  You have given up the ability to claim private interests here by virtue of your choice to sign that contract.  The only thing that could weigh in the balance against that is if there is some -- something that has nothing to do with your convenience but is instead a feature of -- of -- something about why it's important to the judicial system, to the public interest, about keeping the trial in one place.  And as Justice Alito suggested, you have not been able to point to anything, nor would there be anything to point to, in most cases involving forum selection clauses.   Elena Kagan  No.  Bremen is an admiralty case.  Why won't it just be a forum non conveniens?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  I mean, 1404, it says that if it's says -- if the contract clause specifies a Federal court, it's a 1404 motion.  If it specifies a State court, it's a forum non conveniens motion.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's not 1406.  It's just forum non conveniens, which is--   Elena Kagan  --Professor Sachs says that in the case of any disputed facts on a 12(b)(6), you would have to have a trial.  Do you agree with that?

Elena Kagan  General, you were -- you were telling me a little bit about the history of this statute.  But why 30?  Is there any indication of why the State picked 30?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If that's where it comes from, then it does relate to a kind of estimate, doesn't it?   Elena Kagan  General, on your theory am I correct that the North Carolina legislature could amend this statute tomorrow to make it two-thirds?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's what I mean.  I mean, on your theory it seems not to matter whether this statute says one-third or two-thirds.  And I'm asking whether that's correct.   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm not sure I got that.  In other words, I'm assuming an amendment that just all it does is it changes one-third to two-thirds.  And so your theory it seems to me would work the exact same way.  Then you say: Well, you need a rational basis for doing that.  But I thought you told me that the one-third really doesn't have anything to do with an estimate of how much is medical and how much is not medical.  So it seems that you would have the same basis to say two-thirds as you do to say one-third.  Am I wrong about that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you're saying there's a kind of side constraint, that Medicaid recipients have to be treated like others, but then presumably, the State could change everybody's?   Elena Kagan  Well, General, how about this, and I am having a little bit of trouble here because I think a State could come in, or I think there is a reasonable argument that a State could come in and say, you know, we've made an estimate, and here's our best estimate, and we don't think there is a need for an individualized decisionmaking on top of that.  But as I understand your argument, that is not what you are saying.  You are making a very different kind of argument, suggesting that you can take this number any place, no matter what the relationship between the number and the actual allocation that cases -- that allocation of medical and nonmedical damages in the real world.  So if that's the case, what do I do?   INTERRUPTING ",12-98XX
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Browning, let me give you a different rationale for this statute.  It's different than the one the State suggests, but it would go something like this:  There is an allocation that has to be made.  In making allocations there are two ways of doing it.  We can do it case-by-case, individualized decisionmaking; or we can use some bright-line rules.  And the advantage of bright-line rules is that they are cheap and efficient and sometimes they are not more inaccurate than individualized decisionmaking, because in individualized decisionmaking you can maker errors, too.  So this is a reasonable way to make an allocation decision.  And nothing that we said in Ahlborn suggests that a State needs to use case-by case decisionmaking rather than bright-line rules to make the allocation that it needs to make between medical and nonmedical damages.  What about that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And in those rebuttal presumption States, can both sides come in and try to rebut it?  So the individual beneficiary can try to rebut it, but the States could as well?  Or is it just a right for the beneficiary to try to rebut the presumption?   ",12-98XX
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, but at the same time, Mr. Goldstein, and this really follows up on Justice Kennedy's question, the statute makes entirely clear that the EEOC has the prerogative to decide what kind of offer by the employer is acceptable or not.  And there's nothing to suggest that the EEOC even has to be reasonable in determining what sort of offer by the employer is acceptable.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Goldstein, could we talk about that confidentiality provision?  Because in addition to just the enormous discretion that this statute gives to the EEOC, the other thing that tends to work against you is this thing: Nothing said or done as part of these informal endeavors can be used as evidence in a subsequent proceeding.   Elena Kagan  And your entire position would have all the stuff about this conciliation come in as evidence in a subsequent proceeding, which is to say, come in as evidence in the litigation of the lawsuit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm just saying as a matter of fact--   Elena Kagan  --there is discretion in the sense that the statute clearly gives it to the EEOC to decide what's acceptable in the end.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  But you yourself are making this part of the case.  You're essentially saying that the EEOC has to come in and prove that it conciliated in good faith or whatever term you want.  So it's become now, by virtue of your own argument, part of the case.  And how is that to be part of the case and how is all this to happen unless the informal what's said and done in the informal endeavors come in.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't even understand that distinction.  You're making it a part of the merits.   Elena Kagan  I would have thought that the point of the provision is very clear.  It's the same point as anything which says when you're involved in settlement negotiations those stay in settlement negotiations, and it's to protect the settle -- the integrity of the negotiations.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Do you want them to put their minimum offer on the table?   Elena Kagan  That's a necessary part of conciliation?   Elena Kagan  That is intrusive.  I mean, you're doing your best job of proving Ms. Saharsky's point here, because you're saying they have to put all the reasons on the table, they have to say why it is that they're asking for what it is that they're asking for, they have to say, you know, what they would be -- the only -- the last thing that they would find acceptable.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1019
0,"Elena Kagan  It's a rule of brief writing, right?   Elena Kagan  Exactly.  It does -- I mean, here are two preconditions to endeavoring to conciliate a claim, right?  One is we actually told them what we were objecting to, and the second is we talked.  So could we just have the EEOC come in with an affidavit saying, we told them what we were objecting to and we talked and it didn't work?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Talked or--   Elena Kagan  --communicated.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you would not object to that; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  But then, yes, to the extent--   Elena Kagan  --that -- so this goes back to the Chief Justice's first question.  To the extent that somebody comes in and says either they never told me what this case was about -- that is, they never told me what the claim was -- or they never communicated with me, that that would be a fair thing to review that doesn't get into your sort of spiraling out of control, what -- you know, how hard did you try, and what positions did you take--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --But just we told them what the claim is, and we talked about the claim.

1,"Elena Kagan  But suppose it weren't the taxpayer.  I mean, suppose a State has a form that's equivalent to the Federal W-2, requiring employers to say how much wages have been paid.  And suppose the employer itself challenges the use of that form, what do you think the result is in that case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But where -- where do you get, Mr. Isaacson, this idea that the -- the plaintiff has to be the taxpayer?  Because certainly the text of the statute does not say that.  The text of the statute speaks to what kinds of remedies a court can give.  It does not speak to what kind of plaintiffs have to bring the lawsuit.   Elena Kagan  I guess I don't -- what I don't understand about your statutory argument, I mean, it seems a kind of natural thing for somebody to say suppose it's like we're going to all have pizza tonight, and we're going to take up a collection to buy the pizza.  And I assign one of my clerks, go collect the money for the pizza.  So what that clerk is going to do is he's going to figure out who it is that's going to owe the money, right?  Who's going to partake of the pizza, so who owes the money.  And then, you know, maybe he's going to send an e-mail to those people and he's going to say you owe this money for pizza.  And then if no -- if somebody doesn't pay, he's going to identify the delinquent and -- and say, really, you owe this money for pizza.  So that's all part of the collection process, isn't it?  I mean, basically, identifying -- informing the -- the people who have to pay, informing the people who have to pay and identifying the people who don't pay, and -- and the amounts that they owe.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it's importance for a reason.  It's importance to enable them to collect.  Essentially the State is saying we're not going to be able to collect this tax unless we do these things, unless we tell people that they, in fact, owe the tax and unless we have a mechanism to make sure that people who don't pay the tax are identified.  And that's what all these forms are all about.  It's about collecting a tax that most people do not pay.   Elena Kagan  But wouldn't you agree that in any case in which a -- a government goes about collecting the tax it has to say how are we going to collect this tax.  And this is just this State's answer to the how are we going to collect this tax.  Well, what we're going to do is that we're going to inform people that they owe the tax and then we're going to get information that enables us to make sure that the delinquents pay up.  That's how we're going to collect it.   ",13-1032

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Laramore--   Elena Kagan  --that one way of looking at it, but might I suggest that you gave in a little bit too fast to Justice Alito that the phrase “ relating to a controlled substance ” has to modify “ law ”.  It's -- it's very true that usually in grammar a phrase like that would modify the last noun--   Elena Kagan  --which this case is “ law ”.  There is another noun in this sentence, which is “ violation ”.  And can I suggest to you that maybe, if you read this entire provision, it's pretty clearly talking about violation, because here is the way it reads.  It's --  ""convicted of a violation of any law relating to a controlled substance other than a marijuana offense. ""  “ Other than a marijuana offense ”.  Now, it just doesn't make any sense to say, a law relating to a controlled substance other than a marijuana offense.  What makes sense is to say, a violation of law--   Elena Kagan  --other than a marijuana offense.  So this last phrase, “ other than a marijuana offense ”, which is an exception and so you say what's it an exception to?  The offense is an exception to the violation.  So the violation is the key word doing the work in this phrase.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  It's not the conduct.  I think you misspoke when you said that.  It's -- the violation is the crime of conviction.   ",13-1034
0,"Elena Kagan  How about half and half?   Elena Kagan  But if I understand the way the law works, right, Ms. Kovner, that's -- that is true of paraphernalia drugs, that they're indivisible with respect to the controlled substance.  It's not true with respect to most possession statutes or distribution statutes or so forth.  And the reason that there is that distinction is because paraphernalia offenses are generally extremely minor offenses; they're not felonies.  They're just, as in this case, they're misdemeanors that are meant to catch leftover things that, you know, prosecutors plead to when they don't really want to charge a more serious offense.  And so it makes good sense that all of these paraphernalia offenses would be counted out by this approach.  You're counting out a bunch of trivial -- I mean, you know, “ trivial ”, I don't want to say trivial -- minor offenses.   Elena Kagan  But -- but as Ms. -- as Justice Sotomayor suggested, it's a significant practical problem that's implicated in the current practice of the BIA.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It at least might be implicated in the current practice of the BIA.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Ms. Kovner, I would think that the history works against you in the following way: Because the prior statute here was a statute that listed all these Federally controlled substances.  And that eventually got to be impractical, there were too many of them, they kept changing and so Congress went to this approach.  But it was clear in the old statute that the only way that you could be held deportable was if you had been convicted of an offense, you know, possession or distribution or whatever, with a Federally controlled substance.  And there's no reason to think that in enacting this statute that -- that Congress meant to do something broader than that.  There's every reason to think it wanted to do the exact same thing.  If you're convicted of a controlled substance -- of possession of a controlled substance, you are deportable.  If you're not, if it's only Sudafed, you're not.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  But the question is, when Congress makes a change like that, which we know is a change for a particular reason because the list of substances was getting out of control -- it's very much like yesterday's case; I don't know if you're familiar with that -- but Congress makes a change for one reason, suggests -- does not make any -- any suggestion that this change is supposed to do something else and something much bigger, which is extend this deportability provision to controlled substances that aren't part of the Federal list, and there's just no reason to think that Congress did that in making this change.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If he had cocaine in his sock, he would probably be convicted of possession of cocaine.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  He was convicted of paraphernalia here because he had four pills of Adderall, which if you go to half the colleges in America, people you know, and just randomly pick somebody, there would be a decent chance--  [Laughter]   ",13-1034
1,"Elena Kagan  Could I ask about that, Mr. Kneedler, because it seems to me that part of what's motivating that Respondent's position and their amici's position, and I'm not sure that this maps on very well to the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, but part of what's motivating it is a sense that agencies more and more are using interpretative rules and are using guidance documents to make law and that there is -- it's essentially an end run around the notice and comment provisions.  Now, whether that has anything to do with Paralyzed Veterans or not -- I mean, what would the government say is the correction for that or the remedy for that or -- I mean, because the government is sort of asking for it all.  It's asking for a lot of deference always, it's asking for the removal of the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine, it's asking for a pretty strict demarcation between interpretative and legislative rules.  So what's the solution to the problem that I think the Respondents are basically identifying?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Kneedler, one of the very strange things about this case is that I thought that in SmithKline and I recognize that the government probably doesn't like this aspect of SmithKline but that SmithKline basically says when it comes to Auer deference, if the interpretation has been unstable over time and if the interpretation has created a kind of unfair surprise for private parties, that those interpretations do not get Auer deference.  So the very kinds of interpretations that we're talking about here, which is revised and amended interpretations, they don't get Auer deference in the first place.  So this whole notion that we're supposed to be so worried about this because we're going to give it Auer deference, well, we don't.   INTERRUPTING ",13-1041
0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Ho, I think that this entire case has been litigated with everybody accepting that this was an interpretative rule.  Now, maybe that was wrong.  Maybe you should have come in in the first instance and said, really, we think this is a legislative rule and so it had to go through notice and comment.  But you didn't do that.  Everything that happened in this case happened on the view that this was an interpretative rule and the question is what followed from that classification.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  But to the contrary, Ms. Ho, I mean, the entire Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine is about when interpretative rules get notice and comment, have to get notice and comment, if ever.  It's not about the division line between interpretative rules and legislative rules.  So when the D.C. Circuit starts citing Paralyzed Veterans, it's on the assumption that what we're talking about is an interpretative rule.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's not just loose language.  If you go back to Paralyzed Veterans itself, they deal with two arguments.  The first argument is what's become known as the Paralyzed Veterans Doctrine and then they say, oh, you know, there's another argument in the case, which is that this isn't an interpretative rule at all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --Ms. Ho, can I take you back to what--   Elena Kagan  --I thought was the question in this case, which has to do with the Paralyzed Veterans doctrine.   Elena Kagan  And I guess what I would like for you to do is simply to try to explain that doctrine to me, and on the view that is a doctrine about interpretative rules and what it says is that there are occasions when interpretative rules must be done through notice and comment and that those occasions are when the interpretative rules make a significant revision to a stable -- a prior stable interpretation.  So could you explain to me just why that is so?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why--   Elena Kagan  --I think I understand that but it seems to me that that would apply as well to the initial interpretation as to the revised interpretation.  In other words, if you really want to say an interpretation somehow changes the legislative regulation, then that happens at the moment the interpretation takes place, doesn't it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, but again--   Elena Kagan  --Auer deference actually is more strong with respect to the initial determination than -- initial interpretation than with respect to a revised interpretation.  So I don't think Auer deference can save you from this little conundrum.  The conundrum is why it is that an interpretation should be viewed as -- as changing the regulation such that notice and comment is necessary when it's a second interpretation but not when it's a first--   Elena Kagan  --Well, Ms. Ho, I think that you've just said that Paralyzed Veterans is wrong then, because, I mean, the D.C. Circuit has two lines of precedent.  One line of precedent is all about how to distinguish between legislative and interpretative rules, and I forget what the principal case is but there is a four-part test, and that's what it uses.  And Paralyzed Veterans it uses for a different purpose altogether, which is that when it's decided that something is an interpretative rule, there is still another question to be asked which is whether that interpretative rule revises a a previously stable interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but it's an amendment of the legislative rule--   Elena Kagan  --Of the regulation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I understand the fourth prong of American Mining to be essentially the question of whether the interpretation is in conflict with the previous regulation.   Elena Kagan  But then, I mean, go back to what Justice Scalia asked you, which is that if you drop this kind of reinterpretation of Paralyzed Veterans and you assume that what we are dealing with here is an interpretative rule, then you don't think notice and comment is required.   ",13-1041
1,"Elena Kagan  Do -- do you think that it's the same test? In other words, is the test a specific jurisdiction test here, based-on, arising-from, that we are basically asking the same question as we would be asking if this were a -- a foreign corporation?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the why -- I mean, it doesn't seem to me that that wording is very different from the wording that we've used in specific jurisdiction cases.  The wording here is ""based on"" -- we've used ""arising out of."" Sometimes we've used ""related to."" In some respects -- I mean, it's pretty clear that the FSIA is meant to ensure that when a foreign government is acting as a commercial actor, it gets treated like a foreign corporation.  And the language here is very similar, right? There's the insistence on a sufficient contact, a minimum contact, and then there is the insistence on a particular kind of relationship between that contact -- contact and the claim. So it seems -- I guess the question is: Why should we think of these two questions as at all different? And I don't know, by the way, I mean, that it would hurt you if they were the same, because it might just be there would be no specific jurisdiction here, you know? But I guess I'm having trouble of thinking why it is that there -- that there would be a different test.   Elena Kagan  Would -- would you agree and -- and, as you've been doing, take out the agency question -- but would you agree if -- if what had happened here was that the ticket was not honored.  You know, the plaintiff bought a ticket, and the ticket was not honored, and -- and the suit was where the ticket was purchased, would you agree that that's based-on?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Just a breach of contract case.   Elena Kagan  In Austria, even though she bought the ticket in the United States? You think even the breach of contract case could not be brought in the United States?   Elena Kagan  Could you go back and explain to me what -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Because --   Elena Kagan  What about apart --   Elena Kagan  But not general jurisdiction.   Elena Kagan  I was really talking about specific jurisdiction.  And, of course, Justice Scalia is absolutely right with respect to general jurisdiction, that all you look at is the contacts.  But with respect to specific jurisdiction -- this is a company that doesn't have pervasive contacts --   Elena Kagan  -- it's critical to the due process analysis that there be a relationship, and a real relationship between the particular contact with the United States and the lawsuit in the exact same way that this statute focuses on. And so, again, I don't know if it hurts you. It might be, as Justice Ginsburg says, that there wouldn't be specific jurisdiction here for a corporation.  But -- but -- but why shouldn't we treat those two things exactly the same way?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  Well, that's an answer for why there is no specific jurisdiction here.   Elena Kagan  And you can make the exact same answer in the completely private context.  And you --   Elena Kagan  -- could well be right.  I'm want to ask Mr. Fisher about that.   Elena Kagan  But it's not an answer for why the tests should be different.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but how is based-upon different from the language we routinely use in specific jurisdiction cases? In other words, it just seems as though Congress, in line with its objective of treating foreign government engaging in commercial activity in the same way as they would be treated in the foreign corporations case, in line with that objective, used language that's virtually synonymous with the language that we use in specific jurisdiction cases.   Edwin S. Kneedler  But -- but it -- it did it in the context of a statutory structure that is designed to protect foreign sovereign immunity and not to draw U.S. courts into what could be very sensitive international questions of having U.S. courts pass judgment on what happens in a foreign country.  For --   Elena Kagan  So Mr. --   Edwin S. Kneedler  -- that happened in Saudi Arabia.   Elena Kagan  In -- in my contract hypo, if the -- if the suit was a breach of contract action, do you think it would be based-upon? Just a straight, like, you don't -- you didn't honor my ticket?   Edwin S. Kneedler  On -- on a contract claim, I think that there well -- may well be a contract claim here.  But I think it's important to recognize that a breach of contract claim, just because there is some connection with the United States, does not automatically -- even for due process purposes, some connection of a contract to the forum is not enough. The Court made that point in Burger King about contracts which was discussed in the -- in the Court's Walden v. Fiore case.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kneedler, how about -- there is a contract claim in this lawsuit, so there is a -- is a kind of warranty of fitness kind of claim. How -- how about that? Why -- if you think that the -- let's assume that the contract claim, which is like you didn't honor my ticket, that there would be personal jurisdiction over, how do we separate out the warranty of habitability or fitness claim?   Edwin S. Kneedler  Because I think -- I think that's very parallel to what this Court confronted in the Nelson case where the -- the Court said the failure to warn -- there was a claim there too, a failure to warn about the hazard -- about the potential tort.  And the -- and the court said, it -- it would not recognize jurisdiction by that sort of feint of language.  You can't recharacterize something that is basically a tort abroad by claiming that there was a failure to warn --   Elena Kagan  Is -- is that a typical thing --   Edwin S. Kneedler  -- about the tort.  We think that's true here.   Elena Kagan  Is that a typical thing or an unusual thing to do in jurisdiction cases? In other words, to say, we're just not going to look at this claim by claim, we're going to ask about the whole gist of the lawsuit.   Edwin S. Kneedler  We think that, at least for tort claims, that, again, under our -- our position you look at the foundation of the claim, the gravamen of the claim.  And applying that principle to tort claims, anyway, it's proper to look about where -- where the conduct occurred, the tortious -- the injury-causing conduct occurred rather than the injury itself?   ",13-1067
0,"Elena Kagan  No, but not for everything. I mean, let's assume this.  Let's assume that I get a brochure from the Vienna Opera Company, and I send back the order form, I'd like to buy tickets, okay? Now, for sure, if the Vienna Opera Company refused to honor my tickets, I have a claim, and it arises out of the fact that they have marketed my tickets in the United States. But now they honor my tickets, and I go up the stairs, and I slip in a puddle, and I injure myself. What does that have to do with the only contact that they've in the United States? I mean, at that point, you're just saying it's a but-for test, and everything would be included.  But I don't know of a sensible specific jurisdiction analysis that would -- that would run like that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  But in point of fact, that's all OBB does.  So, effectively, your argument is an argument that OBB is subject to jurisdiction in a general jurisdiction kind of way with respect to everything that they do.  And, you know, I think what the Chief Justice is suggesting is, like, that seems wrong.   Elena Kagan  Well, if --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if that's true --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If that's true, I don't understand why you answered my hypothetical question the way you did, because in my hypothetical question I thought you said that there would not be jurisdiction to sue in the United States when I slip and fall in Vienna. And -- but you could make the same argument. Well, there was a duty created in the United States, and that's what I'm suing on.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, there's -- I mean, the only thing that's happened in the United States is that I've purchased a ticket there.  That's -- that's what I've done.   Elena Kagan  So I take it that your argument is that purchase of a ticket gives rise to a duty which is then violated when I slip and fall in another country.   Elena Kagan  But you also have to have a relationship.   Elena Kagan  Well, let's say that I don't accept that argument, okay? Let's just for a moment assume that on a straight negligence claim, the idea that a negligence claim arising from an accident in Austria arises -- let's say I think it arises from the accident in Austria.  It does not arise from the purchase of a ticket in the United States, okay?   Elena Kagan  Now, I guess there's still a question as to whether your warranty claims ought to be treated differently.  And I take it what Mr. Kneedler has said about that is, no, they shouldn't be, that's just fancy pleading, it's just a way of converting a negligence claim into a contract claim.  It's the same kind of thing that happened in Nelson that we refused to allow.  Why isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING ",13-1067
0,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Martinez, wouldn't that argument suggest that Irwin was really only good as to new statutes?  As to statutes that were passed after Irwin?   Elena Kagan  But, you see, I would -- I guess I would have thought that really anything pre-Irwin, the government could stand up and make a very, very similar argument, which is, you know, in this world we actually thought that a statute of limitations with respect to a suit against a government was jurisdictional, did not include equitable tolling, that there were really no decisions the other way, that Congress thought of that as the background rule.  And so what's to prevent this case from essentially becoming everything prior to 1990 is presumed to be jurisdictional contra Irwin?   Elena Kagan  I take it that your argument would apply not only to 2401(b), but also to 2401(a)?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it's the same language.  And if I understood the argument you're -- you're making, it's -- your essential argument is this incorporated the Tucker language, Congress knew what the Tucker language meant, therefore, Congress understood these to be jurisdictional as well.   Elena Kagan  I meant, I have to think that this is just all over the U.S. Code, this kind of language.  There's nothing unusual about this language “ shall be barred ”.  This is kind of the classic language, right?   Elena Kagan  It sounds to me like, the way you're going about this inquiry, we're going to have to take a case on every statute of limitations in -- in the U.S. Code.  Because you're saying, well, this is similar enough and maybe this would be a little bit different, it has a few fewer words, and then we have to look at the history, and we have to stare at the drafting concerns of Congress.  And I thought that Irwin was supposed to take us away from all that.   Elena Kagan  Sure.  But there are two kinds of ways that you can rebut something.  One is by saying, here's something very distinctive about this statute that shows that Congress meant for it to be jurisdictional, that shows that Congress didn't mean for equitable tolling to apply.  But that's not the kind of argument you are making here.  You're making an argument that basically says in this pre-Irwin world, Congress understood that when it came to statutes against the government, they would be jurisdictional and equitable tolling would not apply, see the Tucker Act.  And that could be said, I think, for every statute with respect to suits against the government prior to Irwin.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry, which language are you talking about?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, “ shall be forever barred ” seems, to me, to be the most important part of that language.

Because you have these hypotheticals in the last page of your brief where you say that a complaint could survive a motion to dismiss if the Secret Service members had, you know, announced, had admitted that they had an intention to discriminate or if they had told the local police that.

Some signs say the President is great and some signs say the President is terrible.  And the Secret Service members had only removed the ones with the signs that said the President is terrible.

Elena Kagan  I think you're changing my hypothetical, or let me just explain my hypothetical.

Elena Kagan  Mr. Wilker, sorry to take you back to this, but in this--   Elena Kagan  --case, do you concede that a reasonable officer, even if not these officers, these officers might have had a terrible motivation, but that a reasonable officer could look at this map and say, look at the distance between the alley and the outdoor patio, you can throw an explosive in there, that seems really bad, let's get these people out of the way?  Could a reasonable officer have said that?   Elena Kagan  I'm not sure I understand that, because it seems to me there either is or isn't a valid security interest.  Now, whether they acted because of that valid security interest is, of course, a different question, and you might say, well, there was a valid security interest, but that's not why they acted.  But as to the first question, I mean, there either is one or there isn't one, no?  And we look at it and we say, what would a reasonable police officer think of the security interest here?

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Lindstrom, I -- I understand that argument, and it seems to me a very natural reading of the statute.  But the -- I'm troubled by the scenario where it's dismissed and then it's reversed, not for these practical reasons people that have been talking about.  But it seems to me that if you were really reading the statute that way, that that would count as a strike, too, and that that strike would not go away even when it was reversed. And so I'm wondering whether the statute is actually a little bit more ambiguous than -- than you are suggesting, because at the very least, I mean, everybody agrees that you have to make an exception for that case, and it seems to me that on your reading of the statute, that case would be included.  A strike would be a strike even if it's reversed.   Elena Kagan  Yes, but that's something -- you're now appealing to some default principle that exists outside of the statutory text.  I can't find any basis in the statutory text for that result. I mean, it's -- there have been three or more prior occasions in which either an action or an appeal has been dismissed.  Now, one of those dismissals was later reversed, but it was dismissed.  And so on your reading, we -- we really, you know, it's -- it's -- your reading is kind of -- this is the natural reading, but we're not going to -- we're not going to apply the natural reading in a case where it obviously doesn't fit.   Elena Kagan  You know, and this is what I'm not quite sure about in your answer to my question, Mr. Lindstrom, is, if I understand you right, and tell me if I don't, you're basically saying that we look to these background principles and we decide that a strike doesn't happen if something is reversed on appeal, so a strike is kind of dependent on what happens on appeal. But when you say that, aren't you kind of giving up your best argument? I mean, aren't you then admitting that the notion of a strike encompasses what happens on appeal and encompasses finality on appeal?   ",13-1333
1,"Elena Kagan  Why is it you think --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Let's say I agree with you that there needs to be a concrete injury; that Congress needs to have recognized something that looks like a concrete injury.  But why isn't that exactly what Congress did here? So let me just frame it in a hypothetical. Suppose that there's just a statute -- it's a little bit of a simpler statute, and you can argue with me or tell me why it might or might not be different, but I just want to understand your position. Suppose that there is a statute that just says that one of these credit reporting agencies shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people, or shall -- shall not do it willfully or negligently or what have you, but shall not disseminate inaccurate information about people.  And then there's a cause of action that says if they disseminate inaccurate information in a credit report about you, you can sue. All right? Is that enough of a concrete injury for you?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  But let me focus on what seems to be --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- the gravamen of the claim. And why isn't the dissemination of false information about you in a credit report, why isn't that -- why isn't it -- it perfectly sufficient if Congress says that's a concrete injury?   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  You said that there were reasons why that was not a concrete injury --   Elena Kagan  -- the dissemination of false information about a particular person. Why? Because to me, I'll just say, seems like a concrete injury to me.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You know? If -- I mean, if somebody did it to me I'd feel harmed. And I think that if you went out on the street and you did a survey, most people would feel harmed.  Most people would feel as though they had some interest that had been invaded.  And Congress recognized that, thought it was a significant problem, passed a statute to deal with that problem.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's quite right.  It's not -- it's not completely in the common law tradition. But we've said many times that Congress gets to look beyond the common law tradition and gets to identify real world problems out there in the world, harming people in real-world ways.  And that, it seems, is what Congress did here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  These are not -- these -- these are not unimportant details.  This is a -- they basically got everything wrong about him.  You know, they got his marital status wrong, they got his income wrong, they got his education wrong.  They basically portrayed a different person than --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Here's the thing, Mr. Pincus.  It seems to me that the -- the one thing that we have to say Congress is better at than we are is identifying concrete harms.  I mean, it's perfectly fine, and I agree with very large portions of your brief when you say they have to have identified a concrete harm.  It's like, fine, yes, they do. But now the question is, did they identify one? And it seems pretty clear what they wanted to do here; that this statute is entirely about preventing the dissemination of inaccurate information in credit reports which they seem to think is both something that harms the individual personally and also harms larger systemic issues.  And then they gave the cause of action to the people it harmed personally. And I guess -- I mean, don't we owe them a little bit of respect that they've actually identified a real-world harm that it -- that's out there?   Elena Kagan  But that's a really hard thing to do, Mr. Pincus.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  People get these reports, and you don't know what they're doing with these reports.  They might have not given you a job for that reason, or they might have not given you a job for some other reason.  They might have not given you credit for that reason, or they might have not given you credit for some other reason. I mean, it's actually the quintessential kind of injury that you will never be able to detect and surely not to prove.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.   Elena Kagan  Well, I agree with you entirely on that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Go ahead.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Congress does it by doing it, you know? Congress doesn't announce exactly --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- here we are, we're just going beyond the common law.  It just does it.  And -- and it does it -- and it did it here. It said, you know, what are we concerned about? We're concerned about following the kinds of procedures that will make sure that there are accurate credit reports.  And then Congress told you exactly why in the purposes section of the statute.  And my gosh, it's all over the legislative history. The most serious problem in the credit reporting industry, Congress says, is the problem of inaccurate and misleading information.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And -- and so Congress has clearly done that here. And I guess I -- if you want to just explain to me why it is that Congress can't do -- I think we've said that Congress can do that, can go beyond the common law, and certainly can go beyond anything that we've ever said is a concrete harm as long as they've identified a concrete harm.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Of course, harms can arise in the world, and can be identified in the world even though they haven't arisen before, or been identified before.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If you're saying that, I agree with you.   Elena Kagan  But why did Congress do that, Mr. Pincus? Congress did that --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- Congress did that as a safe harbor. We are not -- it's a kind of industry-friendly act that Congress did.  It said we're not going to punish any old inaccuracy.  We're giving you a safe harbor.  If -- as long as you followed a certain set of procedures, don't worry about it. But did that procedural requirement -- this is -- this is exactly what Lujan says, ""It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which could impair a concrete interest of the plaintiff."" And we distinguished that from procedural requirements in vacuo.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that's what this is. It's a procedural requirement, the disregard of which can impair your interest in being represented accurately in credit reports.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but, Mr. Pincus, the gravamen of this claim, as I said, and as more importantly, as -- as the -- the Respondent has said, is in 1681(e), which does talk about accuracy.  And it makes it clear that the procedures are linked to accuracy. And I totally take your point that, well, how about the person who there's -- there's been no inaccuracy.  Well, that person does not have standing. That person cannot come in and say that he's suffered a concrete injury.  But the person who has been inaccurately represented can come in and say he's suffered exactly the concrete injury that this statute is designed to protect against.   Elena Kagan  Well, was this --   Elena Kagan  Yes.   Elena Kagan  No.  But would this man be able? I mean, this is very much in line with the Chief Justice's. Would he be able to sue based on the fact that there was inaccurate information about him?   Elena Kagan  I guess -- I guess what I -- that's okay.   ",13-1339

And I think that that's the right answer, but I just want to make sure that we're on the -- we're on the same page here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And one very quick thing.

0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Urbanski, let's say that they -- that the Ninth Circuit is wrong in that respect. Let's say that there is an adjudication on the merits here.  All right? But I think that that doesn't solve the basic problem of this case.  There's an adjudication on the merits, but there are these two prongs; there's the harmlessness prong, and then there's the substantive violation prong, whether a Batson violation occurred. And what the court here said was if a Batson violation occurred, it doesn't matter.  It would be harmless. So if you -- for whatever reason, right or wrong -- if you take that harmlessness determination out of the picture, if you say that that was an unreasonable application of law, all right, we're left with essentially a vacuum; right? And so what happens? What does the court do where there's been no finding as to a Bat -- Batson violation? And you're saying that it should kind of make up a reason why there might not have been a Batson violation and -- and go with that.  And why is that the proper approach?   Elena Kagan  Well, you only do if the harmlessness determination is an unreasonable application under AEDPA.  So if that is an unreasonable application, you face the quandary of what you do with respect to the substantive violation.   Elena Kagan  It obviously doesn't arise if the harmlessness determination is perfectly fine.   Elena Kagan  Well, suppose -- I mean, that's a very broad kind of rationale.  It would apply even if the State court said that there was a violation; right? Then you would -- there's a violation, but no worries, it's harmless.  And then you decide that the harmlessness issue is -- is out because that's an unreasonable application.  And then you're going to have a reviewing court say, notwithstanding, that the State court found that there was a violation, we think that there's a credible argument that there wasn't such that we can support the judgment.  Is that what you're asking?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's a little bit counterintuitive.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, would that -- would that also apply -- I'm just sort of trying to figure out the reach of this claim. Just take a case where there was no harmlessness determination.  There was just a single decision about a Batson claim, but it was an egregious decision.  It was, Hispanics aren't entitled to make Batson claims, something like that, egregiously wrong. But I guess under your theory, we just look to the judgment and then we decide, there is a credible way in which to say that this Batson claim was not a good one and that we should defer to that; is that right?

Elena Kagan  Just so I understand the scope of your position, you say that the district court has discretion to figure out, you know, whether a particular person whom your client or someone else wants to sell the gun to is an appropriate recipient of the gun.  But in the absence of that, does the district court just have discretion or must the district court ensure that the gun is sold through a gun dealer? In other words, if -- if your client says really I want it sold through a gun dealer, is that discretionary on the district court's part or is that required?

0,"Elena Kagan  But do you think that the -- the person can pick the firearms dealer?   Elena Kagan  Well, then your -- your position is internally contradictory, right? You think he can pick the firearms dealer.  Well, that's -- that fits within your very broad definition of control.   Elena Kagan  Well, then suppose his friend comes forward and says, I don't really intend to possess this.  I'm going to sell it. That wouldn't be control?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, lucky you. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. O'Connell, can I ask why -- why it is that we're looking at it in terms of the sale? I mean, this is -- this constructive possession question, it would seem to me to make a lot more sense to ask the person who's going to end up getting it, is there a chance that the original owner can control what that person does with it. In other words, you know, I give it to my wife, I give it to my best friend, and I'm really in a position where I'm controlling the use of the firearm. And that seems to me to make perfect sense, not the question of, like, who controls the sale mechanism.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that seems to me very different than the situation here, Ms. O'Connell, because in that case, what the gang leader has is a situation where somebody else is holding a gun for him and he can say anything to that person.  He can say, Use the gun.  He can say, Keep the gun in your closet.  He can say, Sell it to Person A or Person B or Person C. He has total freedom over it. And that's very different from the situation here where the only thing that a person would -- a person in Mr. Henderson's position can do is to sell the gun to a person whom the court approves.   Elena Kagan  Ms. O'Connell, I think it's implicit in what you're saying, but I just wanted to make it clear.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is -- is your argument dependent on the following two facts: The first that there was a probable cause determination, and the second that the Susan Anthony group and the other group wanted to repeat the exact same statement?  Are those the two things that -- that ground your argument?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So if -- I'm sorry.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that would suggest something even broader.  That would suggest that even in the first instance, before the probable cause determination was made, Susan Anthony would know that it's going to be speaking about a very controversial subject in which some people will think it's telling the truth and other people will think it's lying, and that there's a very good chance that somebody is going to bring this to the Commission.  So that would suggest that they have standing even at that moment before the initial probable cause determination is made.   Elena Kagan  Well, I'm not sure it's a reputational harm.  I mean, why isn't, as Justice Ginsburg suggested, the relevant harm the probable cause determination itself?  There are voters out there and they don't know that probable cause is such a low bar as you describe it.  They think probable cause means you probably lied, and that seems a reasonable thing for them to think and that's a relevant harm and we should just -- you know, we don't even need the prosecution to serve as the relevant harm.  That seems quite enough.     They -- they did not rely on any type of that type of harm below and I think -- a harm flowing from the misrepresentation of what the probable cause finding means -- I would think you would have to allege more than they have here with respect to -- that it would exist in this case.  There was no -- they hadn't -- there was no misrepresentations by SBA List, for instance, that this probable cause finding meant that they probably lied.  They told their supporters -- it's in the joint appendix at 74 and 75 -- that all it meant was that you go -- that they found that you have to go before the full commission.  They didn't say to their supporters that you probably lied.   Elena Kagan  Well, but why wouldn't it get into Federal court?  I mean, your own office expresses grave concern about the constitutionality of this statute.  So that suggests somebody should be able to get into Federal court to do this.  But I don't see a way where you would allow a pre-enforcement challenge.  One would have to go through the entire process and get to the end of it and get a judgment to enable a challenge under your theory; is that right?     --Well, I think under our theory, it really depends.  There's two types of cases that are brought.  One is a case like Babbitt, where they're saying the law is ambiguous, it could mean A or it could -- it could mean B.  If it means A, my speech is covered within it.  There, all you essentially have to do is allege you want to engage in the speech that would fall within the rule.  But that's not what they're doing here.  They're saying their speech falls completely outside this law, this unambiguous law, the distinctions between false and true, but we're going to get prosecuted anyways.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Streett, that argument, of course, is just an argument that Basic was wrong in -- in -- in not focusing on -- on Section 18, and that's contestable.  One could say actually, they were right not to focus on Section 18, Section 9 is the closer analog.  But let's put that aside.  Are you just saying Basic is wrong, or are you saying that something has changed since Basic?  Because usually that's what we look for when we decide whether to reverse a case, something that makes the question fundamentally different now than when we decided it.  And that's especially so in a case like this one where Congress has had every opportunity, and has declined every opportunity, to change Basic itself.  So what has changed, in your view?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What is your third?   Elena Kagan  You said three.  What is your third?   Elena Kagan  So -- so you are not relying anymore on the notion that the efficient markets hypothesis has been undermined.  That is not one of the three points that you're making because, essentially, I think you -- you admit this in your reply brief.  You just say Halliburton has never said that market prices -- has never contested that market prices generally respond to new material information.  So you are agreeing with that, that market prices generally do respond to new material information.   Elena Kagan  Well, but we don't have that kind of binary approach.  What we allow plaintiffs to do is to try to establish a presumption, which they do by showing that a particular market is efficient, and then we allow defendants to rebut that presumption.  So there's no binary on/off switch.  It's actually -- it's a presumption, but it's quite dependent on the facts in a particular case as to whether there's an exception to this general rule that market prices, in fact, do generally respond to new material information.   Elena Kagan  Now, we've required them to be considered because--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Streett, there's a -- there's a real difference with respect to those issues and I think that this was really what Amgen said.  It said that when you rule on those things, it essentially splits up the class so that different members of the class are left in very different positions, but that when you rule on a question like materiality, which leaves all members of the class in the exact same position, either with a viable claim or with no claim, and it doesn't split the class in the way that the efficient markets theory do, that's the difference.  And here -- and this goes back to Justice Sotomayor's question -- I just don't see how this splits the class at all because if you can't prove price impact, you can't prove loss causation and everybody's claims die.   Elena Kagan  I think that the -- that the difference is that even if you don't have market efficiency and so you lose the ability to bring the -- a claim with the fraud on the market presumption, you might still have an individual reliance claim.

So suppose an employer does and -- and refuses to fund or wants not to fund vaccinations for her employees, what -- what happens then?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Blood transfusions?   Elena Kagan  So really, every medical treatment.  And Justice Sotomayor is quite right that there are quite a number of medical treatments that different religious groups object to.  So one religious group could opt out of this and another religious group could opt out of that and everything would be piecemeal and nothing would be uniform.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, isn't this a special kind of statute?  Because this is a statute that specifically refers back to a body of constitutional law.  It basically says we want to get right back to the place that we were with respect to religious claims before Employment Division v. Smith.  And so we have -- it's not -- you know, it's a statute that directs us to a body of constitutional law.  That body of constitutional law is, I think, very different from the one you portray in your brief.  It suggests that accommodations should be made sometimes, but rarely, and subject to a -- to a balancing analysis, not to a compelling interest standard in the way we would use it for, say, race discrimination.  So, you know, what's -- what's the response to that?   Elena Kagan  Well, it is applying the statute as written.  The statute as written -- this is not a question of legislative history -- the statute as written points back to pre-Smith law.  It says: That's what we mean.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, again, Mr. Clement as Justice Ginsburg said, this was a very uncontroversial law.  Your understanding of this law, your interpretation of it, would essentially subject the entire U.S. Code to the highest test in constitutional law, to a compelling interest standard.  So another employer comes in and that employer says, I have a religious objection to sex discrimination laws; and then another employer comes in, I have a religious objection to minimum wage laws; and then another, family leave; and then another, child labor laws.  And all of that is subject to the exact same test which you say is this unbelievably high test, the compelling interest standard with the least restrictive alternative.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, she had an understanding of how the Court worked pre-Smith that was a kind of Sherbert v. Verner-Yoder understanding, which was we did a balancing, we looked at the government's interests, we took those very seriously, especially to the extent that there was harm to identifiable third parties and that it fell on an identifiable third party.  That was basically -- you could not get an accommodation for that kind of harm.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, with respect, Mr. Clement, I think that that's probably because the Court has had a different understanding of what RFRA does and the kind of analysis that it requires courts to perform than you're arguing for in this case.  That if your argument were adopted and there was a strict scrutiny standard of the kind that usually applies and a least restrictive alternative requirement, then you would see religious objectors come out of the woodwork with respect to all of these laws.  And because you say that there -- and I think this is absolutely right when you say it -- that you -- you cannot test the centrality of a belief to a religion, you cannot test the sincerity of religion.  I think a court would be, you know -- their hands would be bound when faced with all these challenges if your standard applies.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, I don't think that that's the same thing, Mr. Clement.  There's one penalty that is if the employer continues to provide health insurance without this part of the coverage, but Hobby Lobby could choose not to provide health insurance at all.  And in that case Hobby Lobby would pay $2,000 per employee, which is less than Hobby Lobby probably pays to provide insurance to its employees.  So there is a choice here.  It's not even a penalty by -- in the language of the statute.  It's a payment or a tax.  There's a choice.  And so the question is, why is there a substantial burden at all?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, between paying $2,000 per employee per year if Hobby Lobby does not provide--   Elena Kagan  --You know, Hobby Lobby is paying something right now for the -- for the coverage.  It's less than what Hobby Lobby is paying for the coverage.  There are employers all over the United States that are doing this voluntarily because they think that it's less.   Elena Kagan  Well, let's say that that's right.  Let's say that they have to increase the wages a little bit.  I mean, still we are talking about pretty equivalent numbers.  Maybe it's a little bit less; maybe it's a little bit more.  But this is not the kind of thing that's going to drive a person out of business.  It's not prohibitive.  It's like the thing that we talked about in Braunfeld where we said, you know, maybe if the store can't stay open 7 days a week, it makes a little bit less money.  But so be it, is what we said.   Elena Kagan  But Mr. Clement, it's not saying you must do something that violates your religion.  It's giving you a choice.  You can do this thing or if this thing violates your religion you can do another thing.  And that other thing is approximately the same price as the thing that you don't want to do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can I ask--   Elena Kagan  --But, Mr. Clement, you're not saying, are you, that their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health care?  I thought that you were never making that claim.   Elena Kagan  You know, I'm sure they seem like very good employers.  And I'm sure they want to be good employers.  But again, that's a different thing than saying that their religious beliefs mandate them to provide health insurance, because here Congress has said that the health insurance that they're providing is not adequate, it's not the full package.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but I think even--   Elena Kagan  --that example, you know, initially Title VII did not apply to any employers with fewer than 25 employees.  And then gradually, Congress brought the number down because Congress realized that there were going to be transition issues and that some time was needed to make sure that the compelling interest, you know, should be applied uniformly across all employers.   Elena Kagan  I mean, Mr. Clement, isn't that just a way of saying that you think that this isn't a good statute, because it asks one person to subsidize another person.  But Congress has made a judgment and Congress has given a statutory entitlement and that entitlement is to women and includes contraceptive coverage.  And when the employer says, no, I don't want to give that, that woman is quite directly, quite tangibly harmed.   INTERRUPTING ",13-354X

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Shanmugam, suppose--   Elena Kagan  --Mr. Shanmugam, suppose that in a particular registration statement there was a statement that said a particular kind of transaction was lawful, all right, and the person who makes that statement, whoever it is, really believes it.  But, in fact, that person knows that the Government is breathing down his neck, that the Government seems to have a different view.  That person knows that its competitors have a different view.  And that person has also consulted three lawyers, and two of them have given a different view.  But he still believes what he believes.  He believes that the Supreme Court is going to vindicate his legal position.  But the only thing he says is, I think this is lawful.  Now, why isn't that something where there is an omission that makes the statements misleading?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it just says statements therein.  It doesn't actually say statements of material fact or not.   Elena Kagan  Well, it didn't it didn't impose an obligation to speak, but once you speak, it said that you're that you can't make omissions that make your speech your statements misleading.  And I guess what I'm saying is, you know, what I've given you is a case where this is a judgment call, whether you think something is legal or not.  But what you know and after all you're in the position to know and all your readers are not in the position to know.  What you know is that the Government seems to disagree, that your competitors seem to disagree, and that most of the lawyers seem to disagree.  And still you're going to put this in your statement and say, oh, no problem, that's not misleading.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But don't you think a reasonable reader would look at that statement and say two things actually: Both, he's done something to try to check as to whether the transaction is legal, and he doesn't know anything that's very dispositive going the other way.  And both of those things, I mean, could be false.   Elena Kagan  But I don't think, Mr. Shanmugam, that the fact that the statue has is a strict liability statute might cut the other way.  Why is it a strict liability statute?  Because Congress had some understanding, number one, that it was the issuer who knows the facts, not the readers; and number two, that it is awfully hard to show subjective intent.   Elena Kagan  But there might be omitted facts, such as I didn't check with any of my lawyers, or I checked with my lawyers and they told me the opposite.  I mean, those are facts, and that's the thing that makes the statement in the registration statement itself misleading.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I think what Ms. Saharsky is saying, maybe not Mr. Goldstein, is that there's another part of the statute which is omissions, and that those omissions of facts I didn't check with anybody or I checked with everybody and they said the exact opposite that's the thing that makes my own statement misleading, and that's why it fits within the statute.

0,"Elena Kagan  That doesn't make much sense to me.  A statement is made truly or falsely at the time it's made.   Elena Kagan  So how can you rely on evidence of what happened later?  We would never have closure on a securites action if we would rely solely on the fact that the buliding fell down ten years hence.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Isn't that exactly what you have here?  Because if you look at these registration statements, you know, we have been looking at one or two sentences in a vacuum, but, in fact, if you look at the registration statements themselves, they're sort of surrounded by reasons to discount the opinion.  It says, you know, CMS, the government might think differently, and if that's so, we're really in bad shape.  It says, these laws may be interpreted in the future in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation.  I mean, it seems to me that they actually did a pretty good job of saying, look, we think this, but there are there are some problems--   Elena Kagan  --with this and it could go the other way.   Elena Kagan  Could I just make sure I understand, Mr. Goldstein?  The basis of your argument in the text is not the untrue statement of material facts language, right?  Because I would take it that you agree with the government and with Mr. Shanmugam that as to that, the only untrue statement in an opinion is whether you hold it?  But the basis of your view, both as to agreeing with the government and also suggesting that a further view is the omissions language; is that right?

I mean--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --Mr. Feigin, if we were to rule against Maryland, how many States are in the same position as Maryland, either because they do a county tax themselves or because they allow local jurisdictions to impose their own taxes?   ",13-485X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, don't some States allow localities to impose taxes that do not give a credit?  So, for example, the New York City income tax would be the classic example of that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Perella, you're not saying that we have to or that we should establish a priority rule as to different taxing schemes, do -- are you?  You're not saying it has to be source-based over residence-based, or -- or vice versa?   Elena Kagan  So you are saying that that's the priority rule.   Elena Kagan  Well, let me ask you: I mean, suppose we were to say what Maryland is doing is not okay, but then States could choose.  Some would do a source-based tax, some would do a residency-based tax.  And if you had a situation like that, it seems it could lead to double taxation in exactly this kind of way.  If you were living in the wrong State and all of a sudden the combination of one State having a pure source-based and one State having a pure residency-based tax was going to lead to double taxation.  Why is that any different?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Perella, we said in this American Trucking case, we said we were going to allow States to impose a neutral, local tax even though it violated internal consistency.  Why shouldn't we see this as pretty equivalent to American Trucking?  In other words, a State saying, we're going to impose a small tax to ensure that you are paying for some of the very basic services that we provide.   Elena Kagan  I'm sure that if you aggregate the American Trucking tax, it was a lot of money, too.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But why doesn't Justice Sotomayor's hypothetical, isn't it exactly the same as the American Trucking hypothetical?  You just distinguished the flat tax versus the percentage income tax.  I thought that that was your principal distinction of American Trucking.

0,"Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand that, Mr. Shanmugam.  I mean, one reason that a verdict can be invalid has to do with what happens in the jury room.  And another reason why a verdict can be invalid might have to do with the composition of the jury itself.  And why we should read that language to include the first but not the second I guess I'm just not getting as a matter of language.   Elena Kagan  I know, but -- so maybe we're just going back and forth here.  But an inquiry into the validity of the verdict means asking the question, is the verdict valid?  And the question, is the verdict valid, can have answers that refer either to the deliberative process itself or to the composition of the jury.   Elena Kagan  Well, presumably that's because we assume impact, isn't it?  So the impact is sort of built into the rule.   ",13-517X

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I suppose one idea -- because we have relied a lot on the efficacy of other safeguards, and this isn't this case, so you can just say it's not this case.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, you see, when you say “ similarly situated ”, and I think that's right, but that seems to go to your second argument, which is, look, they're not similarly situated because there's another tax that falls upon motor carriers that doesn't fall upon railroads, and that seems to me completely fair and -- but -- but not on the first question.   Elena Kagan  General, one of the things that Mr. Phillips talks about is he -- he makes the point that this is a very hard inquiry to carry out and that the experience of courts, when they try to do this in commerce cases, shows that.  So what's your answer to that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Goldenberg, could I ask, you know, in one set of cases maybe a railroad is saying we're being singled out.  In another set of cases a railroad comes in and says no, we're not being singled out but our competitors are being treated better than we are.  Are there any other kinds of cases out there or is it mostly just, you know, as compared to the general taxpayer and as compared to competitors?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Lewin, if I can ask you, if your primary position is that this is not a recognition statute, can we talk a little bit about what it is?  I mean, why -- what -- what is the design, what is the effect of this statute other than as something that goes to recognition?   Elena Kagan  But the United States Government does not usually give people that right to self-identify in this way.  In other words, I think this was the Chief Justice's question in the first argument, if you're an American citizen born in Northern Ireland, you can't get the right to say Ireland.  For that matter, if you are an American citizen born in Jerusalem today, you can't get the rights to say Palestine.  This is a very selective vanity plate law, if we might call it that.  And -- and it's selective because Congress had, it appears to me, and it's consistent with the rest of the statute, as Justice Ginsburg said, a real view that this was the self-identification it wanted.  In other words, the ability of American citizens to say yes, I was born in Jerusalem, and that means I was born in Israel.  That and only that self-identification is allowed.   Elena Kagan  Now, people can -- Palestinians cannot -- American-born Palestinians cannot do that.  And that suggests that Congress had a view, and the view was that Jerusalem was properly part of Israel.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can I -- can I give you a hypothetical, Ms. Lewin?  Suppose that Congress passed a law and this law said that the Secretary of State had to send an official letter to all foreign ministers whenever a U.S. citizen was born in Jerusalem, and that official letter from the Secretary of State said says just -- it announces that a new American has been born in Israel.  Would that be constitutional?   Elena Kagan  This is a law passed by Congress and it says every time a U.S. citizen is born in Jerusalem, the Secretary of State has to send an official letter to every other foreign minister saying that a new American has been born in Israel.   Elena Kagan  That would be constitutional, even though the -- the Congress is basically telling the Secretary of State to engage in a certain kind of diplomatic communication with other foreign countries.   Elena Kagan  Yes, exactly right.  That was going to be my point, that it was--  [Laughter]  --that it was extremely similar to what a passport does, that both are forms of diplomatic communication, and that what we usually say about diplomatic communication is that whatever Congress's other foreign affairs powers are, the power of diplomatic communication belongs to the President and the President alone; that in that realm we only speak with one voice.  And so I guess I have to sort of say that that answer that you gave me, that this could -- that Congress could say to the Secretary of State, here's the diplomatic communication that you have to send to other foreign ministers, seems, well, a little bit shocking.   Elena Kagan  Well, if you say that--   Elena Kagan  --Ms. Lewin, may I just I know your time is -- but if I might just go back to the thought that the Chief Justice gave you that you agreed with.  Here's the way a passport begins.  It begins,  ""The Secretary of State of the United States of America hereby requests all who it may concern to permit the citizen. ""  blah, blah, blah.  That's what that's the -- you know, the Secretary of State requests all of these who are going to be looking at this passport.  And then in Haig v. Agee, we described a passport as a letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.  So this is, this passport, it seems, both on what it says itself and on what we've said about it, it's like a letter from the Secretary of State.  It's a communication.   ",13-628X

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Laycock, you're relying on this case really on -- on felt intuitions that this couldn't possibly advance the State's interest.  But for the most part in these cases, there will be some incremental gain with respect to the interests that this State has.  So whether it's a full beard or whether it's long hair or whether it's a turban, there will be some ability to say, even though it's just teeny tiny, there is some increase in prison security that results from disallowing this practice.  And I guess I want to know, and this really fits in with several of the other questions that have been asked here, is how do we think about that question in the context of this statute?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Teeny tiny isn't enough.  But how about, you know, measurable, although small?  Or, you know, at what point does it become something that we say, yes, we have to take that into account?   Elena Kagan  Well, suppose a State just simply says this: You know, actually, there's nothing special about our prison.  We can't show you some special circumstance, but what we can show you is that prisons are in the business of making tradeoffs between security and other values, they do that every single day, and our State just thinks that the tradeoff should be more security oriented, so we insist on a greater level of security than our peer institutions do.  And -- and are you saying that the statute prevents a State from doing that?   Elena Kagan  But I do share Justice Alito's confusion on this point, because all the things that you're talking about are things that we would never allow in the typical strict scrutiny context.  You know, all this kind of well, as long as they say something, they don't really have to prove it and it just has to sound kind of reasonable.  And that's the very opposite of strict scrutiny generally.   Elena Kagan  Do you think it's the same standard in both of those statutes?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The language is completely the same.   Elena Kagan  But I thought we actually used that in the recent RFRA case to suggest something about RFRA as well.  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  Can I ask a similar question?  But, you know, lots of religions, including lots of religions of one, have dietary codes of various kinds.  So suppose a lot of prisoners say, here's my dietary code personal to me, and all of that costs money, and let's just stipulate that as prisoner -- prisons have to spend money on that, they have less money to spend on things relating to internal security.  How is somebody supposed to think about those kinds of questions, where it's just every time somebody makes a religious claim, the costs to the institution goes up and the ability of the institution to deal with security issues goes down?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Congress couldn't have thought that every time there was a notification, the -- the lender was going to agree with the borrower that it was appropriate.  Congress must have thought that -- that there were going to be some cases where the lender and the borrower disagreed, and yet Congress didn't say anything about how those cases would be resolved and that's a puzzling feature of this statute.

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, that seems right, Mr. Waxman, that people understood that there would be litigation and (g) is an acknowledgment of that.  It's an acknowledgment that there are going to be some suits out there and it might be a Declaratory Judgment Act or it might be a foreclosure proceeding or it might be a bankruptcy proceeding, in which the question of rescission was going to come up and on which it was going to be adjudicated.  And all that (g) says is that in those cases the court can award not only rescission but damages.  But that's hardly a requirement that the borrower bring suit subject -- you know, bring suit subject to the (f) clause of 3 years.  It's just not the way you would write a dispute resolution provision.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Waxman, if that's right, so exercising the right to rescind is by notice.  But then you look at (f) and it says,  ""an obligor's right of rescission shall expire.

So that's what expires after three years, your ability to send notice.

1,"Elena Kagan  But if I understand the government's argument, it's that there's a very strong correlation between possession in this case and use for criminal purposes of a kind that clearly would pose a risk of -- of violent conduct and injury.  So are you saying that we never can take that kind of correlation into account, that possession crimes just have to be treated in a box, and we can't think about whether the possession of something increases the risk of use which then will pose a serious risk of injury?   Elena Kagan  So -- so that seems right, that it's a question to pose to the government.  It's like, what's in back of this correlation?  But is your argument, then, they haven't made their empirical case or even if they had lots of statistics, it still wouldn't be enough?   Elena Kagan  When you say “ constructive possession ”, what does that mean?   Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Menendez, I -- I suppose this is connected to Justice Breyer's question. Do you think that there's some core that everybody, in fact, does agree upon? In other words, that there are some offenses which people just say, well, of course that fits within the residual clause.  It's not the kind of thing that creates splits, it's not the kind of thing that creates controversy, that there's a core of agreement as to what it means and that all the trouble is occurring on the margins.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What do you think is in the core?   Elena Kagan  The government says that to declare a statute facially vague, all its applications have to be facially vague.  And I guess you're contesting that standard because you're admitting that at least one thing that you can think of, kidnapping, that there -- that that application would be appropriate; is that right?

Wouldn't that be -- I mean, that's the reason we went down this road, isn't it?   Elena Kagan  So -- so what you're saying, essentially, is that all the statues in the back of the government's brief would count?   Elena Kagan  But nothing else would.  In other words, you have to have it listed specifically, and this conduct created a serious risk of injury.   Elena Kagan  Are you saying that this is something -- in response to Justice Alito's question -- that this is a way that Congress could fix the statute?

And then you say: It doesn't really matter if you're not going to shoot it; you just used it in a criminal activity, that's enough for us.  But this is a good deal more attenuated than that because this person could, for whatever reason, maybe because he wants to commit a crime in the future or maybe he's one of the odd collectors or people who think that this is good for self-defense, this person could have kept it in a locked closet, in a safe deposit box, and never have brought it out and never have any potential for use in a crime.  I mean, it would be one thing to say use in a crime causes enough risk of serious injury, but this is a step further.   Elena Kagan  But they are two separate offenses, right, possession of this gun and use of the gun.  And you're converting the one into the other for purposes of ACCA.   Elena Kagan  Do you think the same would be true of a felon in possession?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't think that in the felon -- a felon in possession law, I mean, honestly, I'm sure the numbers dwarf the sawed-off shotguns, and the whole point of that is, yes, they're people who have shown themselves to be irresponsible, who have shown themselves perhaps to use weapons irresponsibly, and they're going to do it again, and there's a pretty strong correlation of a kind of recidivism that makes Congress pass that law.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that -- that sounds --   Elena Kagan  Well, what is the standard? And this goes back to what Justice Scalia was saying before.  I mean, there's conduct that everybody agrees is annoying.  There are rates that everybody agrees are just -- are unjust and unreasonable.  So how much do we have to say that the core has shrunk and the margins have taken over before we're willing to do this?   Elena Kagan  But I feel as though it's really the same inquiry.  I mean, even as you describe it, it's identify crimes where there -- you know, dangerous stuff, crimes that pose a risk of -- of danger. How much danger? Well, as much danger as these four enumerated offenses.  How much danger do they pose? Well, nobody's really sure.  One of them seems only to pose that a lot of danger in a few select cases. So it's a really -- it just seems, even as you describe it, as the kind of thing that Congress ought to be doing.   Elena Kagan  But you know -- you know, Mr. Dreeben --   Elena Kagan  But I think even --   Elena Kagan  I -- I think even in the ones that you think are easy, they're only easy in the abstract. The vehicular flight one was a good example of that.  In the abstract, everybody just has a sense that it's really dangerous if people flee from a police officer in a car.  But then it turns out there are all kinds of degrees and we have zero idea what the charging is.  And I think that that's not -- that was not a fluke of that case.  That's kind of every case, is that we don't have a sense of how all the statutes connect to each other and what statutes are used for the dangerous ones and what statutes are used for more minor variants of the same offenses, and that that's kind of an endemic problem in this.  Is that not right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but then you're talking about a very different inquiry, it seems to me. Then you're talking about just a gut check.

I mean, in fact we just don't know, right, because we don't know why they acted the way they acted.  It might have been because they thought that the district court's decision was right, or it might have been because they thought it -- that -- that question is better -- was better decided in some other context, or it might be because they were just feeling too busy that day.  And -- and an abuse of discretion standard would go, you know, to the -- just the decision whether to take it, not knowing what that decision was based on.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Berreth, I -- I apologize for going back to this not merits question, but on the question of why the Tenth Circuit did what it did, Judge Hartz, who was, of course, dissenting from denial, made reference to the fact -- and I'm just quoting here -- that the judges were very busy, and the appeal presented a knotty matter that requires a decision in short order.  So even he, who was trying to suggest that an appeal should have been taken, was not suggesting that the court did what it did because the court agreed with the trial court.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Berreth, that assumes that when an appeals court decides whether to take an appeal, all they are doing is making a merits determination.  And if that's all that appeals courts were doing when they decide whether to take an appeal, then you would be right.  But, in fact, we know from everything we do every day that when a court decides to take something or not to take something, they are not just making a merits evaluation.  They are doing a thousand other things as well about how they think it's best to arrange their docket.  And what we don't know is whether the Tenth Circuit here did one of those things.   Elena Kagan  But this statute gives the appellate courts tremendous discretion on this area.  It says it may take an appeal, it may not take an appeal.  Think of the thousand things that you want to think about, not anything invidious, not anything permissible, but, you know, whether to take an appeal.  And that's the only thing we know about it.  Here's a question for you, because I sympathize with you.  Because the next half-hour is going to reveal that, actually, most of us agree with you on the merits.  Right?   Elena Kagan  All right.  I will limit it, I agree with you on the merits.  All right?  But I just don't see how to get around this.  Here's my suggestion.  Would it be sufficient for your purposes, you're worried about the sort of continuing effect of this, to just sort of get rid of this case, dismiss this case, but to -- we often explain why we dismiss cases and to suggest that we are dismissing it because we don't know whether the Tenth Circuit made a decision on the merits.  And if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits, and if and to the extent that the Tenth Circuit wants in the next case to make a decision on the merits when it denies an appeal, it should say so, so as not to insulate that decision from review.  That seems like a fair thing to say to the Tenth Circuit.  Don't insulate your merits decisions from review.  But it also seems to be, you know, to reflect what is true about this case, which is that we don't know whether it made a merits decision.   Elena Kagan  No.  I was not suggesting that we opine on the merits of the case.  I would think that that would be not appropriate.   Elena Kagan  No.  That is not my suggestion, it might be your suggestion.   ",13-719X
1,"Elena Kagan  But I don't see where you get that.  You know, you say (c)(2), which is the preponderance standard, but that's just a standard that the court is going to use to make the determination about whether to be in Federal court or not.  But it seems to me that the statute is best read -- is really only read to comport as Justice Ginsburg said, with the rest of the Federal rules.  It's notice pleading, then the original plaintiff has a choice.  The original plaintiff can contest the -- the removal and present evidence and in that case, the defendant comes back with evidence and the defendant bears the burden of proof and the court makes its decision on the basis of that two sets of evidence.  But why one should think of the original notice as needing to contain evidence is just -- I guess I don't understand where that comes from.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  I just -- you said if it doesn't come in at the time of removal, it comes in at the time of remand.  But there's an alternate position, which is the notice of removal is just the allegation, if the plaintiff wants to contest that, the plaintiff can contest that, and then the defendant has to come forward with something because the defendant has the burden of proof.  Likewise, if the court thinks that the allegation is not appropriate, the court can sua sponte say, you know, you have to show me more because I'm not sure I have jurisdiction over this.  But either way, it all happens in the Federal court after the notice of removal, which is merely an allegation, is filed.  And that makes perfect sense.  It means that most allegations will just be accepted as is and the only ones that everybody will have to come forward with evidence are when there's some reason to contest it, when either the plaintiff or the court has some serious doubt about it.   ",13-719X
0,"Elena Kagan  But could I go back to Justice Ginsburg's first question, because, my fault I'm sure, but I wasn't sure I understood your answer.  Not only in 1512(c)(1), but there are, you know, I think five times in 1512 from a prior enactment this same kind of phrase is used, which is “ record document and other object ”.  And you say that we should treat that phrase as it exists many times in 1512 differently from this phrase in 1519 because of the difference between tangible object and other object.  And to me, it seems like other object is, if anything, a more classic case of that canon that I can't pronounce the name of, ejusdem whatever.  [Laughter]   Elena Kagan  Good.  That's what I count on my colleague for.  [Laughter]  I -- I deserved that.  But to me, it seems like a more -- even a more classic case.  So I guess I just don't understand why you're treating the two differently.   Elena Kagan  But just because Congress includes more verbs -- I mean, the reason Congress includes 20 verbs instead of 4 is presumably because Congress really wants to sweep in a very wide variety of conduct.  And not every verb has to apply to every situation.  In fact, we rather presume that they won't.   Elena Kagan  So your whole argument here really comes down to the fact that Congress put some record-related verbs in there?   Elena Kagan  But I would think -- I'm sorry.  I would think that that cuts against you, that the fact that this is about any matter within the jurisdiction of any agency in the United States shows that it's really not just about corporate fraud, that Congress had a broader set of things in mind.  So I would think that that's -- that's quite the opposite, that everything about this statute, the “ any matter ”, the “ any record ”, suggests breadth.   Elena Kagan  Well, then why is that absurd?  If you concede that that would have been covered, the catch logs, and the prosecutor is trying to do the exact same thing, it's just that he's thrown over a different piece of evidence, why is that such a crazy outcome?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that clearly falls within the statute.  I mean, you can't argue that it doesn't.  So--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --You know, it seems as though this is -- Congress gives very strict penalties to lots of minor things, and -- but that's, you know, that's what it does.   ",13-7451
1,"Elena Kagan  Could -- could you tell me, Mr. Martinez, where are those other provisions?  I -- I think that there are about five of them in 1512.  I take it there are many State statutes, are there?  Are there other Federal statutes?   Elena Kagan  That's okay.   ",13-7451
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Jay--   Elena Kagan  --I -- I just want to make sure I understand your answer to what the gap is between a certain kind of fact and then the ultimate question of law.  So when an expert gets on the stand and gives testimony about what a person in the field, a skilled artisan in the field, would understand to be the meaning of a particular patent term, and you are saying that that's a -- that's factual and that the decision whether to credit that or not is a factual determination.  But how is that different from the ultimate legal question that the Court has to answer, which is kind of the same thing, it's how a person -- a skilled artisan in the field, what -- what that person would understand a patent to mean.   Elena Kagan  So what you're saying is that in certain cases the factual finding truly is the legal determination, but that in other cases, other matters can come in to drive a wedge between the two.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But how would you define the standard?  I mean, it's absolutely true what Justice Scalia says, that at a certain level of generality there is a gap.  But I thought that in order to determine liability, what the court has to inquire into is how a person with ordinary skill in the relevant art at the time of the invention would understand the claim.  And that seems like exactly the question that the expert is testifying to.   Elena Kagan  But suppose an expert just says, in my field skilled artisans think that molecular weight means the following.  Is that a -- and then the district court accepts that finding.  Is that a factual determination in your view?  Because I think Mr. Jay would say it is.   Ginger D. Anders  I think -- well, first of all, that's not what the district -- what the expert testified to here and what the district court found, so I think we disagree about what the district court actually said in its opinion.  But if that were what the expert testified to, then I think that would be a statement of fact, that in -- in the world we understand generally that SEC means MP.  I think that would be a finding of fact.  But I would make two points about that.  The first is that there is then a significant legal analysis that the district court has to do to figure out how to construe the patent, and I think that's particularly clear in the context of indefiniteness, which is what this case is about, that even if the district court has some evidence that generally artisans might understand a term in a particular way, the court then has to look at the claims themselves, the terms that -- that surround the term we're trying to construe, the specification, the embodiments in the specification, the prosecution history.  It has to look at all of that and decide, given all of that, would a person of skill in the art be reasonably certain about how to construe this patent.  So that is a legal inquiry that the court would have to do after receiving the fact-finding.   ",13-854X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Phillips--   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  --I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Is your argument that there are no subordinate factual determinations in these kinds of cases or as you opened by saying, as your argument, sure, there are factual determinations; we can come up with a zillion of them, but it's not worth the candle to figure out which is which.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Mr. Phillips, if that's your argument, I mean, then you'd just have to deal with Rule 52(a) because Rule 52(a) sets out the very blanket rule.  It doesn't say except where it's not worth the candle.  It just says what it says, that these are matters for the trial court.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Phillips, there might be very different kinds of factual determinations that are relevant to patentability than are relevant to interpretation of a statute, so let me just give you one.  I mean, suppose that the validity of a patent depended on when a particular invention was made.  You know, was it done in 1980 or was it done in 2000.   Elena Kagan  And that was absolutely critical to your determination of whether a patent was valid.  But that seems like so within the province of the trial court and--   Elena Kagan  --How do I deal with that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So a question of fact which the trial court ought to get deference on, no?   Elena Kagan  I see, but are you saying that there aren't similar things that could arise within the context of claim construction, just different people's view of what the facts on the ground are?  You know, is molecular weight usually measured in kilodaltons or something else.   INTERRUPTING ",13-854X
1,"Elena Kagan  And, Mr. Schnapper, isn't it right that after trial, when you submitted proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, in fact, you did reference particular districts?  You referenced Senate Districts 18, 19 and 20.  In another place, you talked about all the majority-black districts in the State's black belt, and you explained how your theory of the case related to each one of those districts.   Elena Kagan  I don't understand why that's so, General.  I mean, what the plaintiffs are saying is yes, we have common evidence, not all together usual in a Shaw claim, but here they have evidence.  It's a policy statement that retrogression was going to be a very main priority.  I think it was number 2.  And retrogression was defined in a certain way, as requiring the maintenance of black voting population.  And that was going to be taken into account in every single majority minority district.  Now, the fact that there's evidence, the principal evidence in the case, that relates to every single district and so in a sense the evidence is statewide, does not make it any less a district by district case.   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I would appreciate specific examples, because it seems to me as sort of a going-in matter that when you say this is the most important thing except for the Reynolds inquiry, this is the most important thing, that necessarily it's going to affect the way you redraw or who you put into the districts.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You might not reach the target in every single district, but necessarily you're saying we are prioritizing this race-based this race-based thing, criterion, in a way that's going to affect every judgment we make.   Elena Kagan  Well, how can it not be?  If you have three priorities or three criteria and you say this is the absolute most important criteria, it's just the natural effect of that is going to be to minimize the other two criteria.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you don't deny that a statewide policy can refer to every district or every majority minority district in the State?   Elena Kagan  But again and I don't want to press it if you've given me your best answer to it -- if a policy says we're going to prioritize this particular criteria, which here was the mistaken understanding of retrogression, if a policy says, we're going to prioritize this over everything else, it seems to me that that's pretty good evidence of a violation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if the policy says that it's going to prioritize it over everything else, that means it going to be in derogation of tradition districting criteria.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Sometimes they might fail.  Sometimes you're not going to be able to prioritize it over everything else, but the intent is still to prioritize it over everything else.   ",13-895X
0,"Elena Kagan  Are you really saying that that's a pleading requirement, that they have to come in with a plan that meets all the rest of your criteria?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Brasher, I mean, let me just give you some numbers here from from some of these districts.  Right?  HD 52, you needed to add 1145 African Americans in order to maintain the percentage of African-American voters, which was your number 2 criterion.  You added 1143.  You missed by 2.  HD 55, you needed to add 6981.  You added 6994.  SD 23, 15,069.  You hit at 15,185.  I mean, those numbers speak for themselves, don't they?  That in each of these cases, you were determined, come what may and disregarding other criteria, to maintain the black voting age population.   Elena Kagan  That was just a coincidence?   Elena Kagan  Well, it's 73 percent, and you hit that 73 percent exactly.   Elena Kagan  Well, I think you kind of do actually, because, I mean, you're trying to repopulate these districts, and many of these districts, yes, there are many, many, many African Americans.  But as you just suggested, there are also white people.  And you did it so that you, you know, completely replicated the exact percentage figure.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Brasher, I mean, usually in these cases you're looking at these funny-shaped districts and you're trying to figure out from the shape and from other matters whether race has been used instead of traditional districting criteria.  But this is a very sort -- you know, sort of sui generis Shaw claim, because here the principal evidence in the case is not all the circumstantial stuff that we usually do.  It's a policy statement from the State that says race non-retrogression is going to be our principal criterion except for Reynolds, and then a clear testimony from the people who were applying that policy statement that they thought that that meant maintaining the black voting age population, something which is a mistaken understanding of what retrogression entails.  But, you know, you don't have to look at all the circumstantial evidence about the shape of districts when you have a policy statement from the State saying this is our number one criterion except for Reynolds and this is how we understand it in such a way that it's going to ensure that a 68 percent district stays a 68 percent district and a 52 percent district stays a 52 percent district and so on.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But this is much more than that.  This is very specific saying where the -- the -- the two legislators principally in charge of this said this is what we understand the requirements are, that we're going to maintain the black voting age population in each district.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Brasher, I guess I don't understand your response to Justice Ginsburg.  I mean, there are different interpretations of what those 2006 amendments mean, right?  Under one interpretation, it was basically a codification of Justice Souter's opinion, and so majority minority districts could be transformed into influence districts.  On another stricter interpretation, perhaps, no majority minority districts had to stay majority minority districts.  But in no interpretation does a 76 percent district have to stay a 76 percent district when circumstances change and when the ability to elect candidates of one's choice does not require it.   Elena Kagan  But you don't have to use race in this way, Mr. Brasher.  Nobody would say that Section 5 required you to maintain a 78 percent district and a 78 percent district was no longer needed with respect to a group's ability to elect a candidate of choice.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Brasher, you're suggesting that there's some necessity for a 2 percent plan, but there is no necessity for a 2 percent plan.  States have routinely gone up to 10 percent without getting into trouble under Reynolds.  So that can't insulate your plan from this kind of challenge, can it?   ",13-895X

It thinks about a particular case, it has an idea in its mind of the sort of conduct that they mean, which is this John Dillinger example, but then when it gets down to drafting the words it writes words that are broader than that, that include things that are not in the front of their minds, like this one.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Fisher, you're deriving all this from the word “ decision ” and “ decision ” as even the dictionary you principally cite, Blacks Law Dictionary states, “ decision ”, you know, can mean one of two things.  It can mean an opinion or it can mean a judgment, and people refer to -- it use that word to refer to either.  So why should we interpret it your way?   Elena Kagan  Well, that only suggests that you need reasons.  It doesn't suggest that the reasons have to appear in a decision as opposed to some other document.   Elena Kagan  Well, doesn't that--   Elena Kagan  --All of these kinds of examples, don't they only suggest that a State or a locality would be well advised to write up a little paragraph that clearly states its reasons?  But, you know, if they want to take the risk that a district court is going to say, gosh, I just can't find the reasons in this record, it's all too muddled.  If they want to take that risk, what in the statute prevents it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  But I mean, substantial evidence review requires reasons.  If they want to take the risk that their that their minutes or their transcript will not allow the district court to do substantial evidence review, then, you know, they'll lose.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  As I understand the SG's position, the SG says there were five members of the council, three of them talked about the incompatibility of this tower with the neighborhood.  So what in that statement do you contest?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you think that three of them did not base this on the incompatibility of the fake tree with the neighborhood?   Elena Kagan  The Solicitor General only needs one.   Elena Kagan  Well, then you're going to reach the question that Justice Scalia had a view of, which was, you know, if two people think X and two people think Y and one person thinks Z, is that sufficient?  But as long as you have something that three people think, why isn't that sufficient?   Elena Kagan  Ms. O'Connell, I think part of Mr. Fisher's arguments is that if everyone agrees that reasons have to be given, what sense does it make to require judges to scour the minutes and to scour the transcript and to try to make these judgment calls about, you know, when an individual council member has given a reason?  Why not at that point, once we're in the mode of requiring things, why not just require that the reasons be stated in the two or three sentences that the council or other body promulgates?   Ann O'Connell Adams  It's not our position that such a requirement would be difficult to comply with.  The reason we oppose it is because we don't think Congress went that far.  By requiring that decisions be supported by substantial evidence and providing for judicial review, we think Congress imposed a requirement that reasons be given.  But other than that, they have a savings clause that says that, other than what they specifically said, nothing else should interfere with the decision-making process of local governments.  And so if it's part of that decision-making process to normally talk about it at a meeting and give the decisions orally and then write up a summary that's written, then we don't think that the statute should be--   ",13-975X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Carothers, I wonder whether what Justice Alito pointed out about the nature of local governments, which you agreed with, whether that doesn't suggest that we should try to keep our rule quite simple.  In other words, given that nobody in small local governments has access to great lawyers or knows a lot about communication, that we should just set up a rule that enables them to comply simply.  And that rule, honestly, would be Mr. Fisher's rule.  It would just say, in your decision, write a sentence or two saying why.  Because otherwise, if we don't have that rule and every judge has to look through the minutes and the transcript and anything else in the record to decide whether a reason is clear enough, there are going to be a lot of local governments that are going to get kind of caught, and the judge is going to say, I'm sorry, it's not clear enough, even though if the government had spent just five minutes, it could have made it clear enough.

So one, the very, very highest level might be I affirmatively want to place this person in fear; that's why I'm doing what I'm doing.  All right?  There's a step down from that which is: I don't want to do that; I'm just fulfilling my artistic fantasies, whatever you want to call it; but I know that I am going to place this person in fear.  Is that -- what which intent do you want?   Elena Kagan  The second.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How about you just take it a step down more but not get to the government's.  How about if you don't know to a certainty, but you know that there is a substantial probability that you will place that person in fear, which is what I take it we would usually mean when we talk about recklessness?   Elena Kagan  Well, what would be wrong with a recklessness standard?  Why is that too low?  It seems that a recklessness standard has a kind of buffer zone around it.  You know, it gets you up one level from what the government wants, so what -- who is the person that we should be worried is going to be convicted under a recklessness standard?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Elwood, when we have looked at fighting words statutes, we've never applied this kind of heightened intent.  As I understand fighting words prosecutions, that all the government has to show is that you've said something that would cause a reasonable person to punch you in the face.  And that's all we ask.  So why shouldn't this be basically the same as that?   ",13-983X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, how would using that exact standard -- and it's pretty similar to the standard that Justice Breyer had because the way Justice Breyer had it, it's knowledge that a reasonable person would cause fear.  And you could say -- it's basically the same thing to say -- to say, you know, substantial probability that the person you're talking to would feel fear.  So either way, you know, there is a little bit of a fudge factor as to -- but the critical point is that you have to know something about the probability that you're going to cause fear in another person.  And if you really don't know that thing, then you're not liable.  What would be wrong with that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Dreeben, you are asking us to go down -- you know, it's not purpose, it's not knowledge of causing fear, it's not a conscious disregard of causing fear, it's just that you should have known that you were going to cause fear, essentially.  And that's not the kind of standard that we typically use in the First Amendment.  The only time I can think of is in the fighting words context, because we typically say that the First Amendment requires a kind of a buffer zone to ensure that even stuff that is wrongful maybe is permitted because we don't want to chill innocent behavior.  So I guess the question is shouldn't we allow some kind of buffer zone here past the sort of reasonable-man negligence standard that you are proposing.   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Dreeben, couldn't you say that about a lot of criminal law, that the harm is the conduct, irrespective of what was in the person's head, and yet we insist on looking very often at what was in the person's head?

Now, you've said no, there is a reason for doing this with arson to limit it to the Federal offense.  But I mean, there are a lot of things, a lot of things on that list that have jurisdictional hooks in them.

You would be excluding a kidnapping crime, excluding felon and possession, excluding receiving explosives for the purpose of killing somebody.  So you would be excluding all of those. And then on the other hand, you would be including some things that seem a lot more minor that just happen not to have jurisdictional hooks, like operating a gambling establishment. So you create a world in which the exclusions and the inclusions seem not to match up with anybody's view of -- of a sensible categorization.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Guadagno, this is along the same lines as the Chief Justice's question.  I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but jurisdictional elements are different in one important way, which is we don't require mens rea as to jurisdictional elements. So that's a pretty critical distinction that we've made.  Are you suggesting that jurisdictional elements are different? You know, you have to prove them, but you don't have to -- the -- the defendant doesn't have to have mens rea with respect to them. Why doesn't that suggest that there is a real distinction here between jurisdictional elements and substantive elements that can come into play in this context as well?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But -- but that -- the mens rea example is also an example where we're basically stating what we think Congress meant.  And we're saying, you know, Congress could not have meant to require mens rea for a jurisdictional element. Notwithstanding that there's not language in a statute that says, ""and there shall be no mens rea for a jurisdictional element.""  So why not the same here?   INTERRUPTING ",14-1096
1,"Elena Kagan  Is that really, Ms. Goldenberg, the only textual basis for your position? You know, your brief says a good deal about the difference between ""described"" and ""defined,"" which the Petitioner has suggested is -- is -- is not a very good distinction, because the ""defined"" only refers to actual statutory definitions. So are you still relying on that? Are you relying on anything else in the statutory text beyond the penultimate sentence, or is the penultimate sentence really the statutory basis for your argument?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I believe that Mr. Guadagno's point was that this is -- it's a reason why Congress may have used the language that it did, rather than, say, just arson.  Right? That it wanted -- that it understood that there was a wealth of very minor arson crimes out there in the States, that it wanted to exclude those.  And the way it excluded those was essentially by saying, no, it's got to be the Federal offense.   Elena Kagan  Are there State or foreign RICO offenses at all?   ",14-1096
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Hacker, just looking at the language, I mean, I understand your interpretation of it, but it seems to me that there's, you know, a -- just as good interpretation which says the opposite.  In other words, you know, what does it mean for a suit to be brought to enforce a liability in a kind of circumstance you're talking about? In the circumstance you're talking about, the suit is brought to enforce State law. Now, it's true that State law might look to Federal law; State law might incorporate Federal law in certain ways; State law might have some kind of relationship to Federal law.  But what's the suit brought to enforce? The suit is brought to enforce State law.   Elena Kagan  But State liabilities.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But then you're going to be in a situation where the judge is going to have to try to figure out whether State law exactly mimics Federal law, or whether there are minor deviations from Federal law.  And that can't be a good jurisdictional test, can it?   Elena Kagan  I don't think this is a marginal question.  I think this is kind of a, you know, pretty ordinary question of like, well, what is the State law doing? Is it exactly -- lots of State laws exactly mimic Federal law, and lots of them don't.   Elena Kagan  And you think we can reach that interpretation, even as to the Natural Gas Act consistent with Pan American?   ",14-1132
1,"Elena Kagan  Why do you think, Mr. Stris, this different language was used in these ten statutes?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can I ask you to describe your complaint? In other words, Mr. Hacker has a certain characterization or description of your complaint, and the -- and the -- the role played in your complaint by the regulation.  So if you had to describe your complaint, and particularly, what role does this regulation play in your claims under State law?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Stris, I guess I don't understand why you're resisting just say saying this language ought to be interpreted in the same way as arising under jurisdiction is interpreted.  And it's true they're different words, but it's at least as good an interpretation of these words that they essentially refer to what the arising under test refers to, which after all -- I mean, the arising under test doesn't really have a whole lot to do with the language arising under anymore.   Elena Kagan  So -- so why isn't that just sort of the simplest thing to do is, we have a test, it's a four-part test, and this language seems to fit that test pretty well, and that's what we should do, we should just have one test.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Carvin.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Carvin.   Elena Kagan  Can -- can I offer you a sort of simple daily life kind of example which I think is linguistically equivalent to what the sections here say that Justice Breyer was talking about? So I have three clerks, Mr. Carvin.  Their names are Will and Elizabeth and Amanda.  Okay? So my first clerk, I say, Will, I'd like you to write me a memo.  And I say, Elizabeth, I want you to edit Will's memo once he's done.  And then I say, Amanda, listen, if Will is too busy to write the memo, I want you to write such memo. Now, my question is: If Will is too busy to write the memo and Amanda has to write such memo, should Elizabeth edit the memo? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Gosh --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- you -- you run a different shop than I do if that's the way -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Because in my chambers, if Elizabeth did not edit the memo, Elizabeth would not be performing her function.  In other words, there's a -- a substitute, and I've set up a substitute.  And then I've given -- I've given instructions: Elizabeth, you write -- you edit Will's memo, but of course if Amanda writes the memo, the instructions carry over.  Elizabeth knows what she's supposed to do.  She's supposed to edit Amanda's memo, too.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  He's good, Justice Alito.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ah, but that's --   Elena Kagan  Yes.  That's a very important point, I think, because what you're saying is that the answer to the question really does depend on context, and it depends on an understanding of the law as a whole and whether they were agnostic.  I agree with that. So it's not the simple four or five words because the four or five words in my example, it's obvious that Elizabeth should edit the memo.  It's the whole structure and context of the provision that suggests whether those instructions carry over to the substitute, isn't it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's not --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Carvin, that's not -- that's not what you said previously when you were here last time in this never-ending saga. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  You said the -- you said without the subsidies driving demand within the Exchanges, insurance companies would have absolutely no reason to offer their products through Exchanges.  And then you said the insurance Exchanges cannot operate as intended by Congress absent the subsidies.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't know think that's quite right, Mr. Carvin.   Elena Kagan  I mean -- I'm sorry, Mr. Carvin.  Please.   Elena Kagan  Well, then, I'll ask a question. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  No.  I mean, let's go back to this question of where -- where Congress put this thing because putting aside constitutional issues, I mean, there's at least a presumption, as we interpret statutes, that Congress does not mean to impose heavy burdens and Draconian choices on States unless it says so awfully clearly. And here -- and this goes back to what Justice Ginsburg was saying -- there's really nothing clear about this.  I mean, this took a year and a half for anybody to even notice this language. And as Justice Ginsburg said, it's -- it's put in not in the place that you would expect it to be put in, which is where it says to the -- the States, here is the choice you have.  It's not even put in where the statute defines who a qualified individual is or who is entitled to get the subsidies.  Rather, it comes in in this technical formula that's directed to the Department of the Treasury saying how much the amount of the subsidy should be. And that seems to be -- it both makes no sense from Congress's point of view, and in terms of our own point of view, in terms of interpreting statutes, that's not the clarity with which we require the government to speak when it's upsetting Federal-State relations like this.   Elena Kagan  The -- I think not, Mr. Carvin.  I mean, I think the place I would look to find out about my choices is in the provision of the statute that talks about my choices. I think the last place I would look is a provision of the statute that talks about -- what is it -- coverage months for purposes of this subsection, which, by the way, isn't even the right subsection, but whatever.  That -- that's where I would look, is in -- is in where it talks about what a coverage month is?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  As I understand it --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Wow.  You've been talking a long time.   Elena Kagan  You have two more sentences.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Those were two long sentences --   Elena Kagan  I think -- I think --   Elena Kagan  Yes.  I -- I think I'm right that Justice Breyer's question about anomalies, which are replete in the Act, under your interpretation, did not talk about what I think is one of the most glaring ones, which is this qualified individualist thing, that you're essentially setting up a system in which these Federal Exchanges, that there will be no customers and, in fact, there will be no products, because Section 1311 says that the Exchange shall make health plans available to qualified individuals, and then the next section says that qualified individual means an individual who resides in the State that established the Exchange. So under your theory, if Federal Exchanges don't qualify as Exchanges established by the State, that means Federal Exchanges have no customers.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's -- that's because they don't share your theory.   Elena Kagan  Under your theory --   Elena Kagan  -- that's the result.   Elena Kagan  Ah, but look at the -- look at the prisoner provision, which says prisoners shouldn't be treated as qualified individuals.  So under your theory, this statute effectively said that prisoners should be able to enroll on Federal Exchanges? That makes no sense.   Elena Kagan  But we are interpreting a statute generally to make it make sense as a whole, right? We look at the whole text.  We don't look at four words.  We look at the whole text, the particular context, the more general context, try to make everything harmonious with everything else.  I think you said, even at the very beginning of this argument as we were going back and forth about my hypothetical, that, of course, context matters and context might make all the difference with respect to what those five words mean. And I think what we're suggesting is that, if you look at the entire text, it's pretty clear that you oughtn't to treat those five words in the way you are.   ",14-114X

1,"Elena Kagan  There is one --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There's one -- there's one significant difference there, Mr. Clement, which is that States are on a par with each other.  So there's a kind of mutuality.  So if one State does something to you that you don't like, you can turn it around and do it to them.  And that mutuality also makes it less likely that the State will do that thing to you in the first place because they know that. So -- so I think what Mr. Farr says is the fact that there was this outrage with respect to a Federal court might not have registered in quite the same way when States were aware that they were on a par with each other and that they had many weapons that they could use against each other.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, for sure, Mr. -- Mr. Clement, you know, you couldn't go to war with the neighboring State anymore, and that's a difference.  But you could say, if you're going to treat me like that, I'm going to treat you like that. And -- and you have other ways of dealing with -- with a State that you wouldn't have with the Federal government.   Elena Kagan  But -- but that does raise --   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Clement, Justice Scalia's question does suggest that there are sovereign interests on both sides of this.  Right? There's -- one is I want to have sovereign immunity.  I want to avail myself of sovereign immunity.  And the other is I want to subject another State to my court system when I feel like it, and I want the choice of doing that or reaching an agreement with another State that we should all treat each other nicely. So on your view, the States are giving up some significant sovereignty interest.  They're keeping one, but they're also giving up one.  And the question that you have to answer is why -- why is it so obvious that the States would have made that choice rather than the other choice? Which is, hey, it's been working out for us just fine to have the choice and to deal with our States on a going-forward basis on principles of mutuality.   ",14-1175
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, I think Mr. Clement says that there are two answers to that. One is that they actually never exercised that sovereign interest, so it didn't mean very much to them. And the other is that in exercising that sovereign interest, they would be violating norms of international law, so that they wouldn't have really thought that that was a significant and exercisable interest. But those are his two arguments against that.   Elena Kagan  So Mr. Farr, Mr. Clement suggests that it's unthinkable that a State would be so concerned about being haled into Federal court but not just as concerned or even more so about being haled into suit of another State. What is the response to that?   ",14-1175
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr.  Findley, can I ask two quick clarifying questions just so I understand what's at issue here? Your argument applies to the navigable rivers generally; is that right? In other words, to the navigable rivers running through the federally owned land as well as to those running through the inholdings?   Elena Kagan  And is there any information in the record about whether your client actually was running his boat on the portions which were -- are within the federally owned parts, or instead it's the inholdings? Is that what you called them?   Elena Kagan  Yes.   Elena Kagan  Was Federal --   Elena Kagan  Was Federal public land?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Thank you.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Findley, I mean --   Elena Kagan  -- whether or not that's true, agencies can change their mind about things.  And I think that the question that Justice Breyer is putting to you is this question about what this provision means: ""Shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely to public lands."" I mean, ""solely"" is a very purposive word, you know? I mean, Congress drops lots of words, but you put ""solely"" in a sentence when you mean ""solely."" And this does not apply solely to public lands.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Maybe --   Elena Kagan  I guess maybe -- maybe you can explain that to me.  But it seems to me that if you took it out of the statute, what you would have was to something that says no private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public lands.  And that's what you should want. If -- if it had said that, no private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable to public lands, you wouldn't be here.  You would have won your case already.  But it doesn't say that.  It says, ""No private lands shall be subject to the regulations applicable solely"" -- exclusively, only -- ""to public lands.""   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you're saying that the word ""solely"" distinguishes between statutes like the Clean Air Act and park land statutes?   Elena Kagan  Because I understand why Congress might have wanted to distinguish between, like, the Clean Air Act and park statutes.  But putting the word ""solely"" in, I got to say, does not do that for me.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, tell me the imperfect way.   Elena Kagan  Well, no.  How does that do that? No, seriously.  How does that distinguish between two different kinds of generally-applicable statutes, one generally applicable in applying to park lands and not park lands, and another generally applicable in the sense of applying to both public and private lands within parks.   Elena Kagan  If I understand what you're saying, you're saying with respect to a river that's smack in the middle of federally owned lands, okay, a river that's in the middle of federally owned lands, what cannot happen is that the EPA can't come in and say there's some terrible pollution in this river, and we need to address it.  That would be off limits?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The Coast Guard can do it. The EPA can do.  It's only the Park Service that can't do it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And I guess part of my question about this is, I look at that map, you know, and that map of this area has all this green land, which green represents real Federal park land, and there's a river that runs through it.  And -- and you're saying that that river that runs through the park land, and nobody can do anything on -- or the Feds can't do anything on? I mean, this isn't the inholdings.  I mean, I can understand the argument with respect to the inholdings and the rivers that are running through the inholdings.  But this is the rivers that are running through the park land. Now, it seems to me a very strange thing that Congress would have created Federal lands in a Federal park land but said that the Federal Park Service can't have anything to do with the rivers.  The rivers are like an important part of the park, aren't they?   INTERRUPTING ",14-1209

And then as you say, it goes on and says we want in these plans some idea of what regulations are going to be applying on those private lands within the unit.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1209
0,"Elena Kagan  But I assume, Mr. Green, that there are a variety of circumstances in which police officers would really like to talk to somebody and really like to search them but don't have reasonable suspicion.  And I think that the question that Justice Sotomayor is asking is if you're policing a community where there is some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrants out on them, it really does increase your incentive to -- to make that stop on the chance that there will be a warrant that will allow you to search and admit whatever evidence you gained in that search.   Elena Kagan  Well, but this is an officer who -- you say this is a close call.  So let's say that there are close calls.  But you don't think you have reasonable suspicion, or you think you maybe do if you find a good judge out there, but -- but you -- there is a reason why you want to talk.  So this is not a flagrant violation.  This is not a dragnet search or something like that.  But you -- if -- if -- I mean, it does change your incentives quite dramatically, it seems to me, if you're policing a community where there is some significant percentage of people who have arrest warrants.   Elena Kagan  That's the only way they can be absolutely sure.  But -- but here, there's -- there's some chance that they're going to find the arrest warrant and then they're going to be able to admit the evidence that they're going to get, whereas before, there was none.  And that some chance is not like a once-in-a-blue-moon kind of chance.  In these very heavily-policed areas, it's -- I mean, I was staggered by the number of arrest warrants that are out on people. So it's, you know, a significant possibility that you're going to find an arrest warrant and be able to admit whatever drugs or guns or whatever it is you find.   Elena Kagan  So what is an intervening circumstance, in your view? What is your test for what it is?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  And your view is that we should look at the question of whether something is an intervening circumstance through the deterrence lens. That makes a lot of sense.  We look at everything through a deterrence lens with respect to the exclusionary rule.  And that, you know, what we're supposed to say is this -- does this appreciably increase deterrence or not; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  And I -- so I guess, then, I'm back to my question.  In a world in which finding somebody with an outstanding arrest warrant was an extremely low probability, you would be right.  In a world in which it was an extremely high probability, you would be wrong. Then it seems like, where is this on the spectrum? What do we know about that? It sure seems -- I mean, again, I will come back to this.  I was surprised beyond measure by how many people have arrest warrants outstanding, and particularly in the kind of areas in which these stops typically tend to take place. So that, it seems to me, you know, is a pretty strong argument for why this will increase deterrence.   Elena Kagan  But I guess -- I -- I take the point, Mr. Bash, but I guess I just don't understand.  Of course, this is a nationwide rule that we would be setting.  But most Terry stops do not happen in most neighborhoods.  Most Terry stops happen in very high-crime neighborhoods -- appropriately, but where people have lots of arrest warrants. And -- and you might be right about the specific Ferguson case, but I still have my question, which is why doesn't that dramatically change the incentives for police officers in deciding whether to search somebody? If you know that there is a significant possibility that somebody you stop is going to have an arrest warrant, that's another reason to stop them.   Elena Kagan  But does that mean that we're going to have to, in every single case, explore the officer's subjective motivations? Because that sounds like the kind of inquiry that we've tried to stay away from in the past.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1373

Now, maybe they thought a little bit more highly of it in the days when Solem was written, but now it would -- it's -- it's pretty much of a stretch to use subsequent legislative history or subsequent history generally when we're dealing with interpreting a statute. I'm just wondering: Is there a reason why it should be more credited here than in any other context?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Smith, I -- I can understand why people might be concerned, for all the reasons that you're talking about.  We do have pretty clear and settled law in this area with respect to diminishment, that we've said only Congress can diminish, that the idea is that we're supposed to look to congressional intent.  And you say Congress didn't really think in these terms.  And there's something that's fair about that. But Congress did use very different language in different ones of these acts, and we've looked to that language as a pretty good guide to suggesting which ones diminish and which ones do not.  And it seems as though the language here in -- in the act in which we're concerned -- it's -- it's none of the language that would suggest that Congress diminished this act. So I was wondering if you could talk to that.  Is there anything in the language of this statute that suggests a diminishment? Any of the usual kind of we cede everything, we relinquish everything?

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Clement, that might be so.  But what happens if somebody did just object to objecting? It seems all your arguments would apply the same way.  In other words, somebody comes in and says, I do object to objecting because objecting will make it easier for the government to fill my slot. That's a perfectly understandable thing to say.  And that's part of my sincere religious belief.  And you say the sincere religious belief is what controls.  And there too it would seem under your very theory you would have to say that that's a substantial burden, even if it's objecting to objecting.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  Yes.  I mean, we have the same penalties that we have here, and the person is just objecting to objecting.  And that's part of the religious belief because that will make it more likely that the government will be able to fill the slot and to take efforts to, you know, to -- to provide contraceptives.   Elena Kagan  Well, it's a hypothetical that's directly implicated by your very theory of the case, because your theory of the case says that everything depends on a person coming in saying this is against my religion, and that being the end-all and the be-all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You're just not answering the question.   Elena Kagan  So if I understand that answer, it's that if a person had a sincere religious belief that objecting to objecting was a form of complicity, then that would control, and you would have to go to the second part of the analysis, which is to say, is there a compelling interest test? Has the government's response been narrowly tailored? But essentially, the objecting -- the difference between objecting to objecting and your clients' position is not a difference at all with respect to the burden analysis.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess what I'm saying, Mr. Clement, is I understand the factual distinction that you're making, but the factual distinction doesn't matter given your own legal analysis.   Elena Kagan  I thought there was a -- a very strong tradition in this country, which is that when it comes to religious exercises, churches are special, and that -- you know, we have said this most recently in Hosanna-Tabor, but it's a long line of cases which says that there's something very special about churches themselves. And -- and if you're saying that every time Congress gives an exemption to churches and synagogues and mosques, that they have to open that up to all religious people, then the effect of that is that Congress just decides not to give an exemption at all. And that's why there are some people who are extremely strong RFRA supporters who have deserted this cause right here, Professor Laycock among them, because of the mortal danger that it poses to churches.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco, I have to admit to not quite understanding this argument, that -- it seems as though the most important laws, the laws that serve the most compelling interests, are -- often have exceptions in them.  There are often small business exceptions.  There are often transition rules, like the grandfathering provision here.  And if, every time that existed, somebody could come in and say, well, the government must not really believe in this law because there is an exception to it, state -- allows some people -- then, I mean, we might as well pack it all in. There's not a law in town that doesn't have exceptions like that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's lower and lower every single year.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Here is the incentives that you would put in place, Mr. Francisco.  You would be saying to Congress, Congress, next time you pass a law, don't put in an exemption for churches; you're going to get in real trouble doing that.  Don't write transition rules that will help people adjust to a new legal regime; you're going to get in real trouble doing that.  Don't write exemptions for small businesses, even though there are very particular concerns that small businesses face; you're going to get in trouble for that.  Now, those are terrible incentives to give to a legislature, are they not?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco, may -- may I ask a question? Is there any accomodation that the government would offer that would in fact result in women employees of your clients, or students of your clients, getting health care as part of an employer-based plan or a student-based plan, getting contraceptive coverage? Is there any accomodation that would be acceptable?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  Through -- in other words, is there -- is there any -- you object to this notification.  Is there any kind of notification that would be acceptable?   Elena Kagan  No.  The religious employers, their employees do not get contraceptive coverage through the employer-based plan.  I'm suggesting -- I'm asking whether there's any accommodation that would result in the women employees getting contraceptive coverage seamlessly through an employer-based plan that you would find acceptable.   Elena Kagan  Well, what might be acceptable if it puts enough distance?   INTERRUPTING ",14-1418

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Keller --   Elena Kagan  And does that have any limits, Mr. Keller? I mean, suppose somebody submitted a license plate to Texas that said, ""Vote Republican,"" and -- and Texas said, yes, that's fine.  And then the next person submitted a license plate to Texas and it said, ""Vote Democratic,"" and Texas said, no, we're not going to approve that one.  What about that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But why -- why wouldn't it allow that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, this is not an Establishment Clause issue.  So I'm -- I'm curious as to why -- what -- what constitutional constraints you think there are and how they would play out as to the kind of hypothetical I just gave you.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How many have you disapproved other than this one?   Elena Kagan  And in -- in -- which -- what other ones have you disapproved?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  All on the ground of offense?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And could -- could I ask, Mr. Keller, if you go down to Texas and you just stare at license plates, are most of them just the standard license plate and then these 400 license plates you see very carefully, or do most people actually have one of these specialty plates?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But there's a very -- there's a substantial percentage that are not? There -- it's not by any means unusual to see a specialty plate?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But in a world in which you have approved 400 license plates and they are pretty common in the State of Texas and you have only disapproved a very select few, you know, it does seem as though you've basically given -- relinquished your control over this and, you know, made it a people's license plate for whatever private speech people want to -- to say.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Mr. Keller, one of the -- one of the concerns that that raises, and this really goes back to what Justice Kennedy said, is that outside the traditional area of streets and parks, this is a new world.  There are all kinds of new expressive forums being created every day and as those come into play, as long as the State says, hey, look, we're going to regulate everything for offense, we're going to keep anything offensive out of this expressive forum.  It does create the possibility that in this new world with all these new kinds of expressive fora, the State will have a much greater control over its citizens' speech than we've typically been comfortable with.   INTERRUPTING ",14-144X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, of course, Mr. George.  If you had a standard like that in a case, in a normal case where we were regulating private speech, of course, we would find that impermissible. But the question is whether this is a very different kind of context. And let's go back to -- I think Justice Scalia said it, about the nature of license plates.  I mean, I think there is a clear regulatory purpose here. It's the government that actually makes the license plate.  I think the license plate continues to be public property, if that's right, like you have to return the license plate.  It has the State's name on it.  It's clearly the official identification that the State gives with respect to a car. So why doesn't all of that make -- make this a very different case from the typical forum cases that -- that we usually address?   Elena Kagan  What happens if private people could submit messages, but they all had to go through the legislature?   Elena Kagan  Well, what's the difference, then? I mean, if you say -- if you think that that would be all right, you know, Texas has said, well, the DMV does it, not the legislature, a different branch of government, but it's government just the same.   Elena Kagan  Mr. George, could I just take you back to the Chief Justice's question for a moment and just make sure I understand it.  Mr. Keller has indicated that there are a number of other occasions in which the State has disapproved plates, and in which the State has done that on the grounds of offense.  Do you -- do you have any objections to those representations?   Elena Kagan  No, but Mr. George, just the worst of the worst, whether it's the swastika or whether it's the most offensive racial epithet that you can imagine, and if that were on a license plate where it really is provoking violence of some kind.  You know, somebody is going to ram into that car --   ",14-144X
1,"Elena Kagan  This --   Elena Kagan  Well, why can't we say that with respect to a breath test that this is a search incident to arrest?   Elena Kagan  Well, I think that this would be based on the notion that it's necessary to preserve evidence, plus the notion which Justice Breyer suggested that this is about as uninvasive as a search can possibly be.  And so that given those two things together, that it is useful to preserve evidence and that it is a extremely uninvasive search, that we can assimilate it into the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine.   Elena Kagan  Yes, but there's something very different in the level of invasion, and certainly it's appropriate to look at the invasiveness of a search when deciding whether to do a search incident to arrest. I mean, if that weren't true, we wouldn't have talked about how much you could get off of a cell phone in Riley.  If that weren't true, we would allow people to do body cavity searches when they do search incident to arrest. So it seems to me that the Court can look at the level of invasion incident to a search when deciding whether a particular search comes within the search-incident-to-arrest doctrine, and that that might be a way of separating out this category of cases from the ones that we were talking about in McNeely.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's, I guess -- please, go ahead.   Elena Kagan  Yes, you're right that it's designed to get at the same evidence, and you're right that the dissipation of the evidence works in exactly the same way.  But you're suggesting that we should close our eyes to the fact that there's a very significant difference in the degree of invasiveness. You know, even assuming that both of these are searches, which I have to say, you know, I think that that's -- we've -- we've held that, and so blowing is a search, there's no question about that, but there are searches, and then, again, there are searches.  There are more invasive searches and less invasive searches.  And I guess my intuitions are that that's an important difference when we think about these questions.   Elena Kagan  Well -- but I guess the question that I asked -- I mean, I agree with you that you do need a recognized exception, and that we should not feel good about making up new exceptions willy-nilly. The question is, why isn't this a search incident to arrest given the various aspects that I've mentioned, the fact that the evidence does dissipate over time, that getting a warrant might interfere with that, and that it's -- relatively uninvasive.   ",14-1468
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. McCarthy, I think what we're -- people are asking you is to try to get some sense of the real world harms here.  So let me ask you to assume something. Assume that you actually could put into practice a system which got you a warrant in 10 or 15 minutes, which many States of a similar kind have done. What then would be your interest in the -- in -- in the rule that you're asking us for?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's what we're asking.  Because if you could get a warrant easily in every case, I mean, then I'm struggling to figure out what your interest is in having the kind of law that you have.  So -- but maybe I'm just not understanding something.  So -- so it really is a question. Suppose you could set up a system where somebody could be reached within 10 or 15 minutes, and they would, in almost all circumstances, give a warrant. And in a couple, say, no, I don't think you've satisfied the requirements, right? So -- and you could do that in 10 or 15 minutes.  What would be the problem with just relying on a system like that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I'm asking about your practical needs, and then, you know, we'll figure out like what is or what isn't consistent with the Fourth Amendment.  But your practical needs.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could I ask you just a different kind of just factual question, which -- how many of these are done roadside, how many are taken to the police station, when are people taken to a police station? What is the practice? Sorry.  I see your red light.   Elena Kagan  Can I ask a different -- maybe a different way of asking a similar kind of question. When we decided McNeely, there were two opinions.  But even the opinion that was, you know, the concurrence, or just -- I don't remember whether it was a concurrence or a dissent -- but the one that was --   Elena Kagan  The Chief Justice's opinion, even that said -- and this was with respect to a blood test.  But the Chief Justice's opinion said, look, if there's 20 minutes between the time that you're stopped and the time that we can get you to a hospital to get a blood draw, and you can get a warrant in that 20 minutes, then yes, you have to go get a warrant in that 20 minutes. So at the very least, why wouldn't that be the case? You know, if -- if you're -- if all of these things -- I mean, I have to say when I originally thought about this case, I had in my mind roadside stops.  But in all of these cases you're actually driving these people to a station house.  So why can't you get a -- at least what the Chief Justice said in McNeely, which is, okay, if you can get a warrant within that time, you have to get a warrant within that time.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why is that? Why -- why in Maryland have they been able to and Virginia not?   Elena Kagan  But there are more and more every year, aren't there? I mean, we're now up to over 40, aren't --   INTERRUPTING ",14-1468
0,"Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Carvin --   Elena Kagan  -- let's assume that that's true and that that is -- counts as an injury-in-fact. We also have this other requirement in the law, which we talk about a lot less, but it seems to be quite well established, which is that there needs to a kind of legally recognized interest.  So it's not just that you have to have an injury-in-fact, although you have to have that, but that there needs to be an injury to a legally recognized interest. So what is the legally recognized interest here that the -- the legislators are banking on?   Elena Kagan  No, that's -- that's -- that's, you know, he wants to be elected.  He has been injured-in-fact in the kind of practical ways we can all understand to be injury.  But this other part of the test really suggests that you need a kind of legal recognition of your claim, and that's what I'm searching for here.   Elena Kagan  Are you saying that that part of our standing doctrine which does look as to whether there is a legally cognizable right is only good for plaintiffs, and that once the inquiry shifts to the defendant, it just completely drops out of the picture?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I wasn't -- I wasn't -- I wasn't contesting the injury-in-fact requirement.  I think I was -- I was asking about -- and it really is a question -- how this other separate requirement, which is that the invasion of -- that has to be to a legally protected interest applies in the context of a defendant.  And you're just suggesting it drops out entirely.  And I guess I'm suggesting -- I mean, I might be right, but it seems odd that a plaintiff would have to show it, and a defendant, it -- it just disappears from the inquiry.   Elena Kagan  So the legally cognizable interest is -- just finish the sentence for me.   Elena Kagan  That just -- that just makes the legally cognizable interest the same as the injury-in-fact requirement.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Carvin, can I -- can I take you back to the merits? Let me give you a hypothetical.  It's not this case.  It's a different case.   Elena Kagan  Let's say that there are some racist mapdrawers, and -- and they say, here's what we're going to do.  We're going to set districts, and we really want to segregate African-Americans.  And so -- and they say, that's our -- that's our first aim. But we also have a second aim.  It turns out that African-Americans vote in a particular way.  And so our second aim is that we are going to achieve some kind of partisan advantage as a result of this segregation.   Elena Kagan  Now what should be the right answer to that question? Is there strict scrutiny in such a case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You're making -- you're making my hypothetical more complicated than it is. We're just -- this it one district, we're just going to segregate all the African-American voters in this district.  We're doing that primarily because of racial reasons.  We don't like African-American voters, and we're just going to keep them all in one district.  And secondarily, that has politically-beneficial consequences for us.   Elena Kagan  Is -- and -- and so the question is, is that unconstitutional, because you know, if I look at that, I say, okay, that's -- the race was your primary motivation.  That triggered strict scrutiny.  You failed strict scrutiny; you're out of the ball game. But you suggest that you're not out of the ball game because you have this secondary interest which coincides with the clearly racist conduct.  And that's the question that I want you to answer.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  So then -- then you're -- then it seems to me you're changing your argument because in my hypothetical, both of these things run together.  They're not in conflict with each other.   Elena Kagan  So you're saying the -- the critical question is not conflict.  I had thought that you thought that the critical question was conflict. Rather, the critical question is which is the primary motivation or which is the but-for purpose, and which is the secondary motivation, even if both run in line with each other.  That's a different kind of test.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  This is -- this is -- it's very clear, just as it is in this case I have to say, they have a list of criteria, and number one on the list is race.  And then we have a lot of direct evidence in my hypothetical that this is for the most heinous racial purposes imaginable.   Elena Kagan  And the question is, does the fact that it also has political benefits, does that insulate these line drawers from what you would think is the obvious conclusion, which is this is unconstitutional conduct?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, he says, this is our first priority.   Elena Kagan  But in my hypothetical --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- it's his first priority because he is a racist line drawer.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That -- that sounds to me as though it's a harmless error rule for racial discrimination.  And we've never had a harmless error rule for racial discrimination.  What we've said is, look, we just found racially-discriminatory purpose, end of case.   Elena Kagan  Yes, but --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the first seven words of that quote are ""in a case such as this one.""   Elena Kagan  And the question is what did they mean by that? And one understanding of what they meant when they said ""in a case such as this one"" is in a case in which there was no direct evidence of racial motivation but only circumstantial evidence, and -- and the -- and the absence or the presence of a map was indeed relevant to the question of whether that circumstantial evidence added up to the conclusion that race was the motivator.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  It's just in a case such as this one, the case before us.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why didn't we ask for a map in Alabama?   ",14-1504
1,"Elena Kagan  Is that what you're making it right on? Do you agree with the Solicitor General that a simple statement from the line drawers that they were trying the best they can to comply with the Voting Rights Act, that that is not sufficient to -- to have strict scrutiny apply?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  No.  I got that. I'm saying assume a different -- a different set of facts where they weren't just saying we have to stick at 53.1, or we have to go at 55.55 percent. Assume a different state of facts where line drawers simply say of course our first priority is to comply with the law.  Do you think that that itself triggers strict scrutiny?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So what you think triggers strict scrutiny is essentially the use of a mechanical target here?   Elena Kagan  It's not related to the ability to elect?   Elena Kagan  But if you -- yeah, I -- I'm sorry.  I --   Elena Kagan  I guess I find this a little bit harder than you just suggested, because this is not Representative Forbes saying, I want to choose exactly the set of voters that's going to increase my own electoral chances.  This is Representative Forbes saying, look, there has been an act of the legislature, and the -- the act of the legislature has given me a certain set of voters, and why don't I have a legally cognizable interest in relying on that legislative judgment when some court has taken it away?

If you were doing it just on policy, would you come up with this same test?   ",14-1513
0,"Elena Kagan  But I don't know how far that gets you, Mr. Phillips, because Mr. Martinez just told us that he'd be happy to call willfulness his test. And willfulness has meant different things to different people here.   Elena Kagan  And there's nothing that Congress did that suggests that, when it used that word ""willfulness,"" it really meant the Seagate test.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  But take a case where -- take a case where there's somebody who absolutely wants to copy a product.  He says, Mr. Jones --   Elena Kagan  A patented product.   Elena Kagan  All right? So same thing, let's call it. Mr. Jones sells a product that involves a patent, and it's selling very well.  And Mr. Smith comes along and says I want to copy that patent and that product and sell the same thing so that I can reap those profits too, and -- and does that. Now, the Seagate's test says that as long as his lawyer can come along at the end and raise some kind of doubt about the patent's validity, the fact that -- I forget whether it was Mr. Smith or Mr. Jones -- but the fact that --   Elena Kagan  The fact that he went and said I am going to copy this patent so that I can reap the benefits of some other person's work, that doesn't make a difference.  And that's, I think, the question that Justice Kennedy was asking.  It seems to stick in the craw a bit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Right.  But that's not enough.  Because, you know, if I'm Mr. Jones and I'm saying is it worth my while to go copy this patent, and I think, you know what? A lot of patents are not valid. I'll take this risk.  I will -- I will make a lot of money selling this patented product, and if somebody calls me on it, I'll go hire myself a lawyer, and that lawyer will come up with some kind of argument about why the patent is not valid after all.

0,"Elena Kagan  Sorry, Ms. Shapiro.  Could I -- could I take you back, because I just didn't understand -- and I'm sure it was me -- the -- the answer that you gave to Justice Sotomayor's first question. And I think it's important, because it focuses on what the actual issue is here: How much is at issue between the parties? If you had a judge that said, I don't think the evidence is up to snuff here, and then said, the thing that takes me over the line is what I think about the defendant's motive, and that's what allows me to say that the defendant is guilty, and that had not been proved, that had -- the State had never offered that into evidence.  It really just came out of the judge's head for whatever reason.  Right? Do you think that that would be a due process violation?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  Okay.  But then -- so the first alternative that you gave, and you said it's not the claim here, but I would have thought it was the claim here because you -- there is obviously a dispute about how to read these words.  And we can talk about the -- how to read these words.  Right? But once you say, as I think you said, and I think you properly said, Look, if what the -- the judge's various comments on motive was basically taking him over the line, was -- that that was the basis for the verdict of guilty, that he didn't think that all the evidence, the other evidence was enough and that that was crucial to his finding, then, if I understand you right, you would say that's a due process violation because at that point the verdict of guilty is based on evidence that was never presented.   Elena Kagan  Well, the judge is just saying it's not -- you know, this is not enough, and it's necessary for me to think about motive as the missing piece.   Elena Kagan  Oh, I see.  So you think that it doesn't matter if the judge thought that the evidence was insufficient as long as the evidence was, in fact, sufficient.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  The judge says, you know, all of this evidence, it's not enough.  For me, motive is critical to a finding of guilt here.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  I mean, so maybe I'm putting words in your mouth, and so tell me if I am. But what I just heard was, look, if he's just telling a story to himself and he basically believes that the evidence that was presented is enough, but he wants to tell a story about some other things that make this all make sense, that's one thing.  But -- but if he's really filling in the pieces and deciding -- and -- and determining guilt based on something that was never in the record, that's another thing entirely, and that that would run into all our statements about one accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt determined solely on the basis of evidence at -- introduced at trial and so forth.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So now I'm going to go back to Justice Sotomayor's second question.  And -- but, I mean, just take a look at what he said here.  All right? His first sentence is, all of the witnesses skirted the real issue.  All right? So all of the witnesses -- there's something wrong with what we've heard from all of the witnesses.  They all skirted the real issue. Okay.  So what was the real issue? What was the real issue? And then he says, the issue to me is that you have a drug dealer on a bike who Larry Owens, the defendant, knew was a drug dealer, and Owens wanted to knock him off.  That's the real issue. And then he says, the State's evidence has proved that fact. What's that fact? Well, that fact is the same thing that he's just said is the real issue, that there was a drug dealer on the bike who knew -- and the defendant knew he was a drug dealer and wanted to knock him off. And then he says, okay.  Finding of guilty. I mean, to me, I -- I guess with all the deference in the world, it's just this judge saying, there's something wrong with all the evidence that's been given to me, and here's what's really moving me to find him guilty.   Elena Kagan  But that --   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I -- this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question, I guess.  We have these statements repeated over and over again.  One accused of a crime is entitled to have his guilt or innocence determined solely on the basis of evidence introduced at trial.  And what I hear you saying now -- and tell me if this is not what you're saying -- but what I hear you saying now is well, that's true as to real things that are extraneous to a proper factfinder's role, all right? But it's not true, as to -- I mean, I'm just going to say -- this made-up facts.  It's not true as to made-up facts; that's different.  You can make up facts, and -- and made-up facts don't come within this rule. Is that what you're saying?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's not just -- it's -- it's not just like so I feel good about the case when I go home at night.  I mean, this is a factfinder who has a -- a very clear role, which is to adjudicate guilt or innocence.  And motive, although not an element in Illinois, motive is relevant to identification, which, in this case, was all about identification.  Everybody said that this case was about identification. So when the judge starts making up things about motive -- and I thought that the State really did not contest that this was all made up, that none of it was in the record that got -- you know, who knows how he got this.  But he starts making up these things about motive, and then indicating that these things about motive are relevant to his adjudication.  To me, I mean, clearly established or not, that just fits under this Taylor principle.   Elena Kagan  I agree with you that there's a question of interpretation.  So, I mean, it seems to me like everything comes down to that.  Like, if you thought that this judge just made up facts and -- and then said, this is critical to my finding of guilt, I mean, I just think you'd have to say that that's a due process violation under Taylor.  That -- that what you do have is you have the ability to come back and say, but that's not what the judge meant.  That's not what the judge said, right?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So -- so that narrows the issue. But then it's just like what was he saying, if that wasn't what he was saying?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But they didn't conclude that.  I mean, Justice Breyer has asked -- you have to give deference, I would think, on the -- the Brecht question, the question of harmlessness.  But why would you have to give question on the merits -- on the merits issue? There was no merits determination. I mean, there are two ways to read this opinion, and neither one indicates that deference ought to be given on the merits.  One way to read it is that they said it was error, but that it was harmless error. The other way to read it is that notwithstanding the fact that they said it was harmless error, they didn't really mean that.  They didn't reach a decision as to the question of whether it was error.  But even if that's the case, there's still nothing to give deference to on the merit side.   Elena Kagan  Well, on harmlessness grounds.   Elena Kagan  Whose adjudication on the merits?   Elena Kagan  We might be going in circles, but I thought you just said if -- even if we -- we view this opinion as not reaching a determination on the merits.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Harmlessness, you get deference on.  There's no question.  Harmless, you get deference on.  The question is whether you get deference on the notion that this surmising about motive was not error.  Because -- because to me, I read this opinion and I say they -- they never say it's not error.  Quite the opposite.  They declare it harmless error.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So harmlessness, I think you're right, is entitled to deference.  But assume if you think that this judge unconstitutionally convicted somebody on the basis of evidence that had never been introduced at trial.  If you think that, how could that not be harmful? That's -- I mean, it's almost tautological.  If the error is that he convicted somebody on the basis of evidence that was not proper to think about, well, of course, that's harmful.  That's why he convicted him.   ",14-1516

It was a made-up finding of fact that created the judge's final conclusion that the man was guilty.  That played some role in that final conclusion.   INTERRUPTING ",14-1516
1,"Elena Kagan  Where -- where do you get that from? What's the principle there?   Elena Kagan  Well, how do we know that that's all Congress wanted to do? I mean, that might have been the -- the -- the scenario in Deepsouth, but Congress used language that could refer to much more than that, that could refer to a majority, that even could refer to a substantial minority.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I'm not sure if that's --   Elena Kagan  I'm not sure if that's true, Mr. Phillips.  I mean, you're reading (f)(2) as having a negative implication, that this is the only time when one component can create liability, is when it's especially made or especially adapted.  But these might be just independent clauses. In other words, (f)(2) talks about a component that's especially made, whether or not it's a substantial portion of the product.  And then (f)(1) comes in and says -- independently creates a rule for a component or components that are a substantial portion of the product. So I'm not sure why we have to read (f)(2) as creating this negative implication as to any product, any single product, as opposed to just saying (f)(2) is about specially made stuff, and it has nothing to do with (f)(1), which is not about specially made stuff, and provides a different test about substantial -- substantiality.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because there's a reason why it's that almost all. I mean, if I said to you, Mr. Tripp, a substantial portion of my former clerks have gone into government work, how many would I mean?   Zachary D. Tripp  Well, I -- I think with any of these things, the interpretation of substantial depends entirely on its context and its purpose, and -- and -- and so this term is used in just, like, a countless array of ways in the law.   Elena Kagan  So you're not pinning this on the -- on the language here, the substantial portion means almost all?   Zachary D. Tripp  Well, no --   Elena Kagan  You are finding it from someplace else? And where are you finding it from?   Zachary D. Tripp  So we're trying to give a gloss on substantiality in light of the context and purpose of this statue as -- as we understand all of 271(f) is designed to shore up the basic restrictioning and is actually making a patented invention in the United States and then shipping it abroad.  Both of the provisions get at that.  We think (f)(1) is situations that resemble the Deepsouth paradigm you're --   Elena Kagan  But then you take Justice Alito's hypothetical, which is a product where there's a single product that is accounting for 90 percent of the time and effort, and whatever the third thing you mentioned was.   Zachary D. Tripp  I think in -- in -- in the one is never enough, (f)(2) was just a complete answer to that.  And if Congress was going to draft a special rule about the supply of an individual super important component, you would have expected to see it in (f)(2), and it's just not there.   ",14-1538

It's -- it's when 50 States devise 50 different requirements for this, different formatting, different particular information requested, that just all adds up to a lot of hassle, which all adds up to a lot of money.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, why was it that you introduced absolutely no evidence of burden in the lower courts here?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that sounds like a one-size-fits-all solution, and there's some value to States being able to think about their own health care needs.   Elena Kagan  And to think about what things they want. So I mean, just again, let's go back to this burden because it is a very intuitive idea that you have on your side: 50 different States; that's a lot of money.  But I guess I wonder why it is a lot of money. I mean, as I understand what's going on here, that all the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield generates anyway.  That all the data that's being requested is data that Blue Cross Blue Shield reports for other people.  That really this is a formatting question, even with respect to the wide variety of States, that the States have started getting their formatting more uniform. So I -- I mean, you know, it's -- you can say it's 93 million people, but, you know, in the end what's the cost?   Elena Kagan  And why don't you have it in the record?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, I guess I just don't understand this argument.  I -- I -- I mean, I -- I understand completely that there should be some restriction on overly burdensome State regulations of whatever kind.  You know, it could be taxes, it could be day care, it could be anything.  Right? But why is it that this regulation falls in a different category than taxes or childcare or anything else? Because the State here clearly is not attempting to, and is not regulating, payment of benefits.  It's doing something that has an effect on your operations, no doubt, but the State is operating in a completely separate area for completely separate purposes in a way that does not trump or conflict with, or anything else, the choices that ERISA has made as to payment of benefits.

1,"Elena Kagan  Do you deny that the plaintiff here -- that Petitioner thought that he was asking for equitable tolling? Because I guess -- I guess this is very similar to the Chief Justice's question, but it seems to me if somebody comes in and he says, I'm entitled to equitable tolling, and the court thinks, no, you're not, equitable tolling is unavailable.  Then what the court should do is something like this.  It should first say, sorry, equitable tolling is not available. Now, is there a different way we can construe your petition? Oh, maybe there is.  We can construe it as a sua sponte decision.  Now in the end that's going to lead you to the same results because we don't have jurisdiction over that, but that that's the proper order of things.  You know, first we'll say, oop, sorry you lose equitable tolling is unavailable, and then we'll do whatever construing we can do to see if there are any alternative avenues, and then we decide there are not.   William R. Peterson  Well, Justice Kagan we believe that's what the Fifth Circuit did, albeit implicitly.  I point to page 3 of the Petition Appendix: We lacked jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of Mata's untimely motion to reopen.   Elena Kagan  No, but there's a -- there is something, and this is what the Chief Justice was saying, too.  There is something that the court does have jurisdiction over and it's the question of whether equitable tolling was available.  That's a merits question, I have jurisdiction over whether equitable tolling is available.  I say it's not or I say it is; doesn't matter, I have jurisdiction over that question either way.   William R. Peterson  The court of appeals certainly always has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction.  So on the way to a jurisdictional ruling --   Elena Kagan  It's not determining whether it has jurisdiction.  That -- whether equitable tolling is available or is unavailable is -- is not itself a jurisdictional question.  That's a merits question. And then when you decide that it's unavailable you can say, okay, is there another way to construe the thing, and that ends -- that lands you in a jurisdictional question as to whether you have jurisdiction over sua sponte decisions.   William R. Peterson  Justice Kagan, as we've tried to suggest it, the timeliness is related to the jurisdiction, because the timeliness of the motion to reopen tells you whether the board's order denying reopening is an order that was solely in the board's discretion or not.   Elena Kagan  But you see there's a little bit of a problem with the way the Fifth Circuit is going about this thing, because what the Fifth Circuit has done is to say that equitable tolling is unavailable and the only time it ever uttered those words is in an unpublished opinion.  And in all the published opinions it's just said, you know, we're construing this as something else and we have no jurisdiction over that. And what that effectively has done is to insulate from our review the determination that the Fifth Circuit has made, if the Fifth Circuit has made it, that equitable tolling is unavailable.   William R. Peterson  Justice Scalia, when Ramos-Bonilla adopted the --   Elena Kagan  He's definitely Justice Scalia. (Laughter.)   William R.

Because as I looked at the board's decision, honestly, I found it a little bit difficult to tell whether the board was denying it on statutory grounds or on sua sponte grounds.   Elena Kagan  So on that assumption, that would, as I understand it, give the Fifth Circuit something new to think about in -- in addressing this question; is that right?   Elena Kagan  I'm -- I'm sorry, but there would be an NPR when? Late this calendar year?   Elena Kagan  Just to try to be a little bit generous to the Fifth Circuit, again, I mean, I started off by saying, I found it a little bit hard to tell what the agency was doing.

I mean, if you assume the premise of Justice Breyer's question, which is that there is a Constitutional violation for keeping somebody in prison for some conduct that can't be criminalized.  The State has set up a collateral review mechanism.  We're not asking it to set up a new mechanism that it hasn't had before.  It has a collateral review mechanism, and the only question is whether it's going to comply with Federal constitutional law in that collateral review mechanism.   Elena Kagan  But Mr. Plaisance, I think what people are saying to you is that this is different from your standard Michigan v. Long question.  It's a different question.  It's a State that says we're not bound to follow Teague.  We know we can do something different, but we want to follow Teague.  That's what we want to do. And then in all its particulars.  All right? And then the question is: If the State commits to following Teague, it's not -- it doesn't think anybody else has committed it.  It self commits to following Teague and to following Federal law.  Then what happens? Is there enough of a Federal question to decide this case? Now, that's not a Michigan v. Long question. It's more like a Merrell Dow question or something like that where Federal law is -- the State has chosen it, but it's just part and parcel of the claim, because the State is so committed to following Federal law in all its particulars.

0,"Elena Kagan  And Mr. Duncan, isn't it quite similar when Justice Scalia used this ""controlled"" language that the Louisiana Supreme Court has used similar language? It's dictated by Teague.  Now, it's only dictated by Teague because they've chosen to make it dictated by Teague, but once that choice has been made, all outcomes are dictated by Teague.  It's the same issue.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Duncan --   Elena Kagan  -- can I give you just a hypothetical? I mean --   Elena Kagan  -- suppose that there is a State and it has a -- a mandatory minimum for a theft. It says the mandatory minimum for theft is 20 years. And suppose a court looks at that and says, you know what? That's incredibly disproportionate to a lot of theft, and so strikes the mandatory minimum. Says, you just can't have a mandatory minimum like that. Make it lower. Would that be a substantive ruling?   Elena Kagan  It does not go to the manner of imposing.  It says nothing about the manner of imposing. What it does is it just increases the range of sentencing possibilities.  It actually leaves it to the -- to the courts.  It says absolutely nothing about what factors ought to be taken into account.  Nothing about that at all. All it says is, you can't have a mandatory minimum of 20 years for theft.  Make it lower.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I think --   Elena Kagan  So if you're saying, no, that's different because there was something else in Miller.  There is something else in Miller.  There is a bunch.  There -- there is -- there is a process component of Miller, no question about it, where the Court says what courts are supposed to look at is -- are the characteristics of youth and are supposed to try to figure out whether these terrible crimes are functions, in part, of immaturity or -- or -- or not, whether you -- you really are looking at an incorrigible defendant. So there is that process component.  But that process component does not take away the fact that there is a completely separate, self-sufficient component as to what the range of punishment has to be. That's completely on all fours with the hypothetical that I gave you.   Elena Kagan  No, you're exactly right. It did not take LWOP punishment off the table.  But, similarly, in my hypothetical a 20-year sentence for theft has not been taken off the table. What the Court has done is to say, there have to be other options.  There has to be an option of ten years or five years or two years -- whatever it is. So they've expanded the range of possibilities.  They've just made the sentences different because the sentence is defined both by its upper end and by its lower end.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So they made the sentence different.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Duncan, I -- I -- I think not.  I think by your own definition this fits on the substantive side.  You said you -- you categorically remove a certain outcome. And -- and -- and that's exactly what Miller does.  If you -- as long as you understand a sentence, which I think you agreed with, as defined both by its upper and -- and by its lower end, effectively what the Court said in Miller was that that sentence, which was the mandatory LWOP sentence, cannot control for juveniles.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There has to be a different sentence.  One that includes other punishments.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That -- that increases the range.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It allows something within the range, but it has -- it has completely changed the range that's -- that is -- that is given for any juvenile defendant.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And the range is important. It's not just the top end.  This is what we said in Alleyne, that you can't think about a sentence without thinking about both parts of the sentence, both the maximum and the minimum.  And when you decide whether a substantive change in that sentence has been made, you look at both: the maximum and the minimum.   Elena Kagan  But this is what we --   Elena Kagan  Which is what we said last year.  We said, it's possible to disassociate the floor of a sentencing range from the penalty affixed to the crime.  And similarly we said, criminal statutes have long specified both the floor and ceiling of sentencing ranges, which is evidence that both define the legally prescribed penalty.

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, why isn't that test satisfied here, because the shop owners agreed that Mr. Ocasio would commit every element of the substantive offense?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the -- the -- Mr. Ocasio is committing every element of the substantive offense.  He is obtaining property from another; that is, he's obtaining property from the body shop owners.  And the body shop owners agreed that he would do so. So it seems to me that in the normal way that conspiracy law works, there is a conspiracy here.   Elena Kagan  They only need to agree that he should obtain property from another, and that is exactly what they agreed to.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, they're two different words, but the syntactical problem seems to me to be identical, which is that it's just not natural to say that the transported woman is herself transporting any woman, right? I mean, the transported woman is not transporting any woman. But the reason the Court said that a conspiracy was possible there was because the transported woman could agree with another person, let's say, the man, that the man would transport any woman, namely, herself.  It's -- it's an almost identical syntactical issue.   Elena Kagan  No, I don't think that's right.  The ""from another"" is clearly an element of the substantive offense.  But you're saying it should also be a freestanding limit on the conspiracy offense, and there's no reason for that to be true.  It is, of course, right that somebody has to obtain property from another, but the conspiracy offense is made out if two people agree that somebody should obtain property from another.  And that's exactly the situation here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  They intended and they agreed that Mr. Ocasio should obtain property from another.  And that's all they have to do.   Elena Kagan  It's a statute, and the statute just says the other has to be somebody different from Ocasio himself.  So in this particular case, the somebody other is the people who are in the agreement. In another case, the somebody other might be somebody who is outside the agreement.  The statute just -- the -- the substantive law says it has to be from another. The conspiracy -- and this is just -- it's consistent with Salinas, it's consistent with Holt, it's consistent with everything we've ever said about conspiracy law -- is that it just has to be an agreement for somebody to do that substantive offense even if the people agree and can't do it themselves. And it's true, the people agreeing can't do it themselves.  They can't obtain property from another. But Mr. Ocasio can, and they're agreeing that he should.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Davis, if you could go back to what you just said about the consent.  I mean, look, I mean, Evans makes perfectly clear that bribes and kickbacks are included in this statute.  And -- and there is a difference between -- there -- there are cases in which somebody participates in a kickback scheme and does not consent. I mean, suppose some public official comes in and says, in order for me to give you a license to do something, to be, you know, a member of some profession, let's say a cosmetologist, you need to pay me $20 as a kickback.  And the person, you know, pays him $20 because you've got to get your license.  But there's no way in the world in which that would count as a conspiratorial agreement.  It would count as consent under the Hobbs Act. So there's a big gap between consent and a conspiratorial agreement, even in the context of bribes.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Davis, I don't think you need to add words.  What you need is to shift perspective.  There is a difference here, but that's the difference, that the government is insisting that you look at it from the perspective of the person who, in this case, is doing the acts of obtaining property from another.  And you are insisting that it be looked at from the perspective of the person who has agreed to help him do that. But there's no reason under standard conspiracy law that we would use the perspective of the agreer rather than the perspective of the perpetrator.   Elena Kagan  There absolutely is a unity of purpose, that one person should do the crime.   INTERRUPTING ",14-361X

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Right.  But --   Elena Kagan  -- this does sound more like an aiding and abetting standard than it does a conspiracy standard, because typically in conspiracy we say it doesn't really matter if you actively participate, as long as you reach an agreement.   Elena Kagan  Now that agreement is more than acquiescence, right? It's more than I reluctantly give you the bribe that you're demanding of me.

And Monsanto says, you know, even though he wants to use that money to pay for an attorney, too bad. Now a bank robber goes in, he has a pile of money, he puts it into a separate bank account, he uses that bank account to pay his rent, to pay other expenses, and he uses the money that would have gone for the rent and other expenses to pay a lawyer. Why should the two cases be treated any differently for Sixth Amendment purposes?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Srebnick, this goes back, I think, to the Chief Justice's first question. It seems that the distinction that you're making is one that the Court explicitly rejected in Monsanto.  In other words, the Court said the Sixth Amendment here is the exact same thing as the First Amendment.  It even used that example that Justice Scalia gave, or that general example. And -- and so it goes back to the Chief Justice's question in -- in the sense of there's a very powerful intuition behind your argument, but it's a powerful intuition that was explicitly rejected by us. And -- and this case doesn't seem to present any different circumstances than that one.   Elena Kagan  I might just be repeating myself, but -- but I thought that, again, that distinction was the one specifically rejected in Monsanto.  I mean, Monsanto could have said Caplin & Drysdale is different because it's postconviction.  But Monsanto refused to say that.

You win, the petitioner loses.  And -- and, you know, that's a fair, strong argument, if -- if one is comfortable with Monsanto. I mean, there is -- so I think I would just ask you, I mean, suppose the Court is just uncomfortable with the path we started down the road on in Monsanto?

1,"Elena Kagan  But what do you think about a case, whether or not this is that case, in which it is quite clear to a judge that each of two defendants is just going to be pointing to the other person and saying, that was the bad actor.  He is why these terrible crimes committed.  And you know that -- you know, each of them is going to be doing that. Should a judge separate the penalty proceeding in that context?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I am asking you in what kind of factual circumstances you would find that standard met?   Elena Kagan  When you said it the first time, you had ""deprived of a fair trial"" and then something about individualized sentencing; is that right? Is that supposed to indicate that this is deriving both from the Due Process Clause and from the Eighth Amendment?   Rachel P. Kovner  Well, the Eighth Amendment does speak to this need for an individualized sentencing determination.  We would think that the Due Process Clause also requires that proceedings be individualized. But we would agree that if there were a situation where there was a joint trial and because of the evidence introduced by one, for instance, a jury simply could not give individualized consideration to a second -- second defendant, that would be a constitutional problem. And to give an example of that -- I mean, I think the example the Court suggests in Zafiro of that is where there is aggravating evidence that pertains only to one defendant, but that that aggravating evidence is just so prejudicial and so overpowering that the jury couldn't really separate the two and would be inclined to sort of judge the second one by association. So I think that's the example the Court gives in Zafiro.  But it's not --   Elena Kagan  Sorry, but I'm not --   Elena Kagan  I think I missed something you said, but -- forgive me.  But the constitutional standard that you're proposing, is that a constitutional standard for both the guilt phase and the sentencing phase? And is it also for both non-capital and capital? Are you drawing no distinctions among those four things?   Rachel P. Kovner  I think that's right, Your Honor.  I mean, that -- because we think that the due process standard essentially subsumes the requirement of individualized consideration, and, of course, due process is applicable at the trial phase and at the sentencing phase in capital and non-capital trials.   Elena Kagan  So it seems a little bit counterintuitive to me, the idea that, you know, the guilt phase in a very minor crime would have the exact same standard applicable to it as the guilt phase of a capital crime and then as the sentencing phase of a capital crime.   Rachel P. Kovner  If I may answer really briefly? Your Honor, we think the reason that's the case is that joint trials often enhance accuracy and fairness.  So we agree that accuracy and fairness considerations are at their paramount in capital cases, but we do not think that militates for a different standard in capital cases because we think that the standard that the courts are applying is one that's going to generally enhance those values.   Elena Kagan  How -- how was the change to the pattern instructions made? Who made it?   Elena Kagan  Is it approved by the Supreme Court or is it divorced from the Supreme Court?

Elena Kagan  Didn't the Court --   Elena Kagan  But General, if I can understand your argument, you're saying not only that that analysis would come out the State's way, but you're saying this -- the lower court really never did that analysis at all, right? It didn't think that it was doing that analysis.  It didn't think that that analysis was necessary because it thought that there was just a per se rule that one had to give this instruction; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I find that a little bit confusing.

What evidence particularly came in --   Elena Kagan  -- and why do you think it might have mattered to the jury? Just give me your best shot.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Maybe I'm missing something, but if -- if your client's strategy was to make Reginald as bad -- the bad actor in the case, why didn't that evidence actually go hand in hand with your client's strategy, which was to say it's all on Reginald?   Elena Kagan  You're not saying that that's required by the Eighth Amendment; is that right? You're not advocating a per se rule that such instructions are necessary.

It says, ""Mitigating circumstances are every juror's individual choice."" In -- in Carr, the prosecutor says, ""Anything in fairness may be considered as extenuating.""

1,"Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Landau, let's assume you're right, that this is a really bad mistake when it comes to arbitration.  So just to take you back to Justice Alito's point and Justice Scalia's point, you know, usually we don't fix bad mistakes --   Elena Kagan  -- when State courts interpret State law.  I mean, there are a lot of mistakes when it comes to interpretation of contracts, including arbitration agreements. So, again, what's the standard? There's nothing on the face of this opinion that indicates hostility to arbitration.  To the extent that you can find reasoning in this opinion, which you have to search to find, but to the extent that you can find reasoning, it's about interpreting form contracts, interpreting -- whenever you see an ambiguity in a form contract, you interpret it against the drafter.  And that's a principle of contract interpretation that, as far as I can see, has been used hundreds of times in California. It appears to be a very common principle of contract interpretation in California whenever California courts look at a contract of adhesion. So why isn't that just what they did, and is what they did?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Landau, I completely take your point as to what the parties must have wanted, and it does make this State court opinion unsatisfying, would be a kind word for it, but -- but, you know, in fairness to the State court, part of the problem was the way this contract was worded.  Everybody else finds ways to word contract provisions like this so that there isn't a problem.  If the contract had said, you know, if class action waivers are invalid in your State, then Section 9 is unenforceable, there would have not have been this problem.  This is -- it's a very unusual contract provision.  Most companies use very clear ones. This one did not. And so the -- the State court had to sort of puzzle over what it meant and, as you say, probably got the answer wrong.  Strike the ""probably."" Got the answer wrong.  But, you know, wrongness is just not what we do here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the -- Volt says the law of the place interprets the law of the place exactly in the way -- or allows that interpretation exactly in the way that this State court interpreted it. The law of the place was just the law of the State unmodified by any possibly preempting Federal law.   ",14-462X

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Bursch, I -- I understand that argument.  It's the principal argument that you make in -- in your briefs, that same-sex marriage doesn't advance this State interest in regulating procreation. Let's just assume for the moment that that's so.  Obviously, same-sex partners cannot procreate themselves.  But is there -- in addition to that, are you saying that recognizing same-sex marriage will impinge upon that State interest, will harm that State interest in regulating procreation through marriage?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, but I don't think that --   Elena Kagan  -- that's right, Mr. Bursch. I don't think that that's right.  I think before something as fundamental to a society and to individuals as marriage, before an exclusion of this kind can be made in that institution, the State needs some reason for that exclusion.   Elena Kagan  And I've given you an -- a real opportunity to tell me what that reason is.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What is the reason for the exclusion rather than the reason for the noninclusion?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But do you think -- do you think that that's what it would do, Mr. Bursch, that if one allowed same-sex marriage, one would be announcing to the world that marriage and children have nothing to do with each other?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, not in the abstract, not in the concrete.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I do think, Mr. Bursch --   Elena Kagan  Mr Bursch, suppose -- suppose this: Suppose that there's a State with a very procreation-centered view of marriage of the kind that you're talking about.  And it -- you know, so emotional commitment and support, all of these, the State thinks are not the purpose of marriage and they want their marriage licenses to be addressed only to the things which serve this procreation purpose.  And so they say, Well, we're not giving marriage licenses to any -- to anybody who doesn't want children.  So when people come in and ask for a marriage license, they just ask a simple question: Do you want children? And if the answer is no, the State says, no marriage license for you.  Would that be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, the State has -- the State has this -- it's not a perfect correlation, but the State says that the best -- the best way to promote this procreation-centered view of marriage is just to limit marriage to people who want children.  So that's what it does.  Would that be constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but this State --   Elena Kagan  What you said --   Elena Kagan  To ask if you want children is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but you're -- but you're the one who said that rational basis, pure rational basis, applies.  And this is a State --   Elena Kagan  -- that's decided that it so wants this procreation-centered view of marriage, that it's going to exclude people who don't want children. It's going to exclude people who can't have children. And the question is, would that be constitutional? And it seems to me it flows directly from your argument that it would be constitutional. But the problem is that we hear about those kinds of restrictions, and every single one of us said that can't be constitutional.  And I'm suggesting that the same might be true here.   Elena Kagan  To keep the marriage definition as -- as you have described it as so procreation-centered, that a State can exclude everybody that does not serve that purpose for that reason alone. And that's the reason you've given.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you see, this is what I think is -- is difficult for some people with your argument, is that it's hard to see how permitting same-sex marriage discourages people from being bonded with their biological children.  So if you would explain that to me.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, you know, they are connected, right? Because if you think about --   Elena Kagan  If you think about the potential -- who are the potential adoptive parents, many of them are same-sex parents who can't have their own children, and truly want to experience exactly the kind of bond that you're talking about.  So how does it make those children better off by preventing that from happening?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  But you, yourself, are saying that the marriage -- the -- the recognition of marriage helps the children, aren't you? I mean, you'd rather have -- the whole basis of your argument is that you want children in marital households.   Elena Kagan  More -- more adopted children and more marital households, whether same sex or other sex seems to be a good thing.   Elena Kagan  Well, I'm just asking based on your policy how it's not a good thing.  I'm not trying to put words in your mouth.  I'm just saying if -- if -- it just seems to me inexplicable given what you've said are your policy interests.   Elena Kagan  Of course -- I mean, of course, Mr. Bursch, we don't live in a pure democracy; we live in a constitutional democracy.  And the constitutional -- the Constitution imposes limits on what people can do and this is one of those cases -- we see them every day -- where we have to decide what those limits are or whether the Constitution speaks to something and prevents the democratic processes from operating purely independently; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, but that's the question, is whether there are these equality limits or whether there are these liberty limits. So let's go back to the liberty limits that you were just talking about.   Elena Kagan  Now, the right to marry. We've had -- we had Loving.  We had Zablocki.  We had Turner.  In all of these cases what we've talked about is a right to marry.  We didn't try to define the right more particularly: Is there a right to interracial marriage? Is there a right to marry if you're a prisoner? We just said there's a right to marry, that is fundamental and that everybody is entitled to it unless there's some good reason for the State to exclude it -- exclude them.  So why shouldn't we adopt the exact same understanding here?   Elena Kagan  Well, they were dealing then with men and women coming together, but the question was, well, there might be a black woman and a -- and a black man or a white woman or a black woman and a white man and -- and there was no inquiry into whether that was a traditional form of marriage.  If there had been such an inquiry in this country, they would have come up pretty short.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Historically, it was not a part of the tradition, that's right.  And the Court said --   Elena Kagan  -- irrelevant that that's not a part of the tradition because --   Elena Kagan  -- because there's no good reason for it not to be part of the next tradition.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Loving was very clearly -- Loving was very clearly not just a racial case, that -- it also was a -- a liberty case?   Elena Kagan  And indeed, Loving was exactly what this case is.  It's a case which shows how liberty and -- and equality are intertwined, wasn't it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  See, to me it seems as though you are doing something very different that we've never done before, which is you are defining constitutional rights in terms of the kinds of people that can exercise them.  And I don't think we've really ever done that.  Where we've seen a constitutional right, we have not defined it by these people can exercise it, but these people can't, especially in a case where the claims are both rights-based and equality-based. I mean, it would be like saying in Lawrence, well, there's only a right to intimate activity for heterosexual people and not a right to intimate sexual activity for gays and lesbians.  And, of course, we didn't do that.  Once we understood that there was a right to engage in intimate activity, it was a right for everybody.   Elena Kagan  Well, it must be --   Elena Kagan  It must be -- But that's why you're drawing distinctions based on sexual orientation in these laws.    Elena Kagan  I'm not asking about -- I'm not asking about your reasons and whether you have any or not.  But whether you have any or not, you are drawing distinctions based on sexual orientation. That's what -- that's what these laws do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What did -- what did we say in Bray? Something about if you prevent people from wearing yarmulkes, you know that it's discrimination against Jews.  Isn't that what we said in Bray? Same thing here.   Elena Kagan  Sorry, the case that I'm talking about said what I said.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Whalen, just a quick question.   Elena Kagan  You -- you acknowledge that if the State loses on the first question, then the State also loses on the second question? It's a fortiori? That's --   Elena Kagan  Okay.   ",14-556X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Wolfman --   Elena Kagan  If -- you might be pulled in two different directions here but you don't have to accept what Justice Sotomayor is saying to win this case; isn't that right? In other words, one could say, yes, if you had discriminatory acts language, that might point to the last predicate discriminatory act as opposed to the resignation, it might or it might not, but here that language doesn't exist.  Here the language is discriminatory matter.  That refers to the entire claim. And when you refer to the entire claim, it's clear that the resignation is part and parcel of that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And it at least creates ambiguity, such that the default rule would operate.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you don't have not to go to that --   Elena Kagan  Well, you just sort of made those two synonymous.  But they don't have to be synonymous.  A matter might mean the claim, not the particular discriminatory conduct that's the predicate for the claim.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  Justice Kagan, I think that the EEOC has, by equating the Federal sector provision with the private sector provision, has suggested that both of these provisions do focus on the alleged unlawful employment practice.  In addition when the EEOC promulgated this rule in its current form, it explained that this rule, quote, continued the rule that had applied under the prior version which used the language alleged discriminatory event. So I don't think the inclusion of the word ""matter"" by itself makes a difference.  After all, it doesn't just say matter.  It says matter alleged to be discriminatory, and we think that has to be read as a whole to clearly focus on what is it that is the target of the claim. And that language is -- it does not become ambiguous just because it might be challenging to apply it in a particular fact pattern.  I think this Court's decision in Morgan is an excellent example of that where the Court said we have a clear rule that requires us to identify what was the alleged unlawful employment practice and when did it occur, and that's the analysis here.   Elena Kagan  I mean, this is an unusual kind of claim and it's an unusual kind of claim because there are predicate acts and then there is also clearly a resignation which clearly has to occur before the suit can be brought.  And when there is this, you know, this composite set of things that has to go on before a suit, it seems to me that it's at least approaching the kind of possible ambiguous -- ambiguous stage to say, yeah, that's a matter, that's a practice that both of those things have to be part of it.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  I think that that's difficult to reconcile with how Morgan treated the word ""practice."" Always bearing in mind, as the Court has explained in a case like Graham County, for instance, the kind of ambiguity that triggers resort to a default accrual rule is ambiguity in the literal text of the provision.  There it was unclear whether a particular limitations period even applied and the Court said, literal text is ambiguous, there are clues that point in one direction, we think this default rule points in the same direction. But the Court hasn't applied that background rule to override language that's -- that otherwise clearly calls for an analysis of, in this case, what is it that the plaintiff alleged to be discriminatory. Here, Mr. Green alleged a discrete act of retaliation that he says occurred in December of 2009. He alleges no repeated or cumulative acts of discrimination subsequent to that date and so --   Elena Kagan  There's something more than just simplicity, which is, you know, suppose you had a case where somebody is first demoted and then somebody is fired.  You would never say, oh, he was demoted.  He suffered the injury then, it just raised the stakes. You would say, no, there's two independent things and now he can bring a termination claim.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  That's right.   Elena Kagan  And the power of the constructive-discharge claim is to say the exact same thing really has happened here, that once you lose the job, it's more than the stakes have been raised.  It's that there is a separate injury that then becomes legally actionable.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  Well, the analysis when there is a demotion followed by a termination is not simply that there's been a second separate injury, but that there's been a second separate violation of Title VII by the employer.  That's why it is a discrete unlawful employment action triggering a fresh limitations period. In constructive discharge, you know, the analysis that the second separate event, the employee's decision to resign is itself the actionable thing, that is the analysis that the court of appeals had applied in Suders.  In Suders the question was: Do we treat constructive discharge as a tangible employment action for purposes of determining vicarious liability.  The Third Circuit said, well, yes, we treat these as equivalents for all intents and purposes, so naturally, when there's a constructive discharge, that means there's been a tangible employment action. This Court rejected that analysis and said, no, the legal fiction does not extend that far.  To be sure, the Court says, we treat those two the same for remedial purposes in the sense that an employee who has been constructively discharged can recover for that to the same degree and for the same extent as if he or she had been actually discharged. That makes sense because you have this background duty to mitigate and, in the circumstance of a constructive discharge, we don't think the employee should be tagged with the consequences of having, you know, so-called failed to mitigate damages.  But that's -- that's the purpose of the legal fiction --   Elena Kagan  But if we're going to say, yes, these are different and for some purposes we're going to look to the fiction and for other purposes we're not going to look to the fiction, it seems to me as though here it makes sense to take account of the fiction in the sense that the person cannot bring a claim until the resignation has happened. So that's the kind of paradigmatic case in which, boy, there is something really powerful pushing that, yes, you can -- you should recognize the constructive discharge as a discharge in this case.   Catherine M.A. Carroll  But the limitations period here does not run from the accrual of the claim, it runs from the time of the matter alleged to be discriminatory, the unlawful employment action.  And as this Court explained in Suders, the constructive discharge entails both predicate discrimination -- and we do think it has to be independently actionable.  We think the Court recognized that when it said in Suders that for Ms. Suders to prove her hostile work environment claim was quoting necessary predicate to her constructive discharge claim, and that's also a uniform holding in the courts of appeals.  There has to be predicate, unlawful conduct by the employer and a subsequent decision by the employee to resign. When you have a provision that singles out as the start of the limitations period one of those two components, then the fact that the claim hasn't accrued yet is not something that the Court can rely on to override that clear language.  I think this Court's decision in Pillsbury is a really excellent example of that under the Longshoremen's Act, there was a provision that ran from the time of injury.  And the plaintiffs pointed out, well, that we can't actually recover compensation for our injury until a disability has manifested, so we should say that we should interpret injury to mean disability.  And the Court said, well, no.  I mean, it's true that that will run the limitation period before the claim can accrue, but the language says what it says. For what it's worth here, I don't think that this reading is actually going to cut off claims except in cases of, you know, real lack of diligence, because here, it's not the case that there's no claim available after the initial act of discrimination by the employer, there is a claim available, the employee can initiate counseling on that, and as a matter of the conciliation policy, he or she ought to do that promptly in order to bring about the best chance of a prompt and informal reconciliation.

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Jones, suppose you had been able to show this.  Suppose you had been able to show that it was a dealer who dealt in intrastate marijuana exclusively.  What difference would that have made under the terms of the Hobbs Act?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you see, that's the thing.  I mean, I don't think that the Hobbs Act requires the government to show an effect on interstate commerce.  As you said in your opening statement, the Hobbs Act only requires an effect on commerce, and then commerce is defined: Commerce means all commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction. Now, for sure the United States has jurisdiction over interstate commerce, but under Raich it also has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking. And so if you just sort of put the pieces of the statutes together, it seems to make it completely irrelevant whether the drug trafficking was intrastate or interstate, because in either case, it was commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But -- but doesn't the Hobbs -- doesn't Raich say that the government has -- the United States has jurisdiction over intrastate drug trafficking?   Elena Kagan  So why isn't that enough? Because this statute, again, does not require that there be an effect on interstate commerce.  It -- it affects -- it requires that there be an effect on commerce as defined in the statute.  And as defined in the statute, all it says is that the commerce has to be one of a kind over which the United States has jurisdiction.  And Raich says the United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing.   Elena Kagan  Well --   Elena Kagan  Mr. --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Jones, I guess I'm trying to figure out what we're disagreeing about.  So let me give you a proposition, and you tell me whether you agree with it. The Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking, whether the marijuana traffic is interstate or intrastate. Do you agree with that?   Elena Kagan  But why is that? Because that's what I was saying at the beginning, that it seems clear to me that under the terms of the Hobbs Act, the Hobbs Act does prohibit robberies that affect commerce. Raich says commerce includes both interstate and intrastate marijuana trafficking.  So the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect marijuana trafficking generally, whether it's interstate or intrastate. What's there to disagree with in that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well --   Elena Kagan  Well, but I said -- I used the word ""affects."" I didn't use the word ""regulate."" I said the Hobbs Act prohibits robberies that affect commerce.  Commerce is either interstate marijuana trafficking or intrastate marijuana trafficking under the definition in this statute.  So you -- the government has to show that a robbery affected some kind of marijuana trafficking.  It doesn't matter what kind. Wouldn't you agree with that? I mean, it just seems --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- it's the current of the statute plus Raich.   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess this goes back to Justice Kennedy's question.  I mean, seems to me pretty self-evident that a robbery of a business affects a business.  Wouldn't you think that that's right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, I don't think that the word ""affects"" is doing a whole lot of work here, because of course a robbery of a business affects a business, right?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So -- so it's not really ""affects"" that's the problem here.  The problem seems to be that you're resisting the notion that the business could be entirely intrastate. But what I'm suggesting is that the terms of the Hobbs Act itself, given Raich, make clear that the business can be intrastate, because the definition of commerce here doesn't say ""interstate commerce."" It says ""commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction."" And because of Raich, we know that the United States has jurisdiction over even intrastate drug dealing.   Elena Kagan  Well, that seems to me a different kind of argument that you're making now.  Now you're not saying that the question is whether the marijuana that was being dealt was intrastate or interstate.  Now you're suggesting that what you really wanted to prove was that this person wasn't a dealer at all; is that correct?   ",14-6166
1,"Elena Kagan  But -- but if -- if -- if I can make sure I understand. The jury is told that you have to find beyond a reasonable doubt that this defendant affected commerce over which the United States has jurisdiction.   Elena Kagan  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  Does that have --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- to be found beyond a reasonable doubt?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But whether the United States has jurisdiction over the marijuana trade, be it inter- or interstate, has already been decided by Raich.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is it --   Elena Kagan  But that's the question, Mr. Yang: From marijuana dealers. I mean, it seems to me the defendant could say, ""no.  ""I was targeting a home grower.""  You know, the kind of person from Raich.  ""I just -- I was growing this marijuana for myself.  ""I had no intention of ever selling it."" At that point, you wouldn't be robbing somebody who was engaged in commerce, right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There are --   Elena Kagan  Well, maybe the person wasn't a dealer.   Elena Kagan  You said it was a very different thing.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And it would be a much harder thing.

So I'm a little bit with Justice Kennedy, that I'm not quite sure what the word ""punishment"" is doing in this context, but if we're looking for punishment, we have indicated that punishment is a subjective concept.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, sorry.  There's a lot to what you say that sometimes the practical concerns are the same for pretrial detainees and for convicted criminals.  There's also something to the other point of view, which is that in our cases, we've consistently said that if you're a pretrial detainee, if you haven't been found to have committed wrongful conduct, you shouldn't be treated the same way as people who have been found to have committed wrongful conduct; that for the convicted criminals, it's kind of, you know, we're allowed to punish them, because they've done something wrong.  And we haven't found that yet for the pretrial detainees. And so what place in your system is there for that, you know, very commonsensical, and also, you know, normatively attractive proposition that people who haven't been found to have done anything ought not to be treated with the same level of disregard for their interests as people who have been?   Elena Kagan  So that might be, but let's take another comparison.  And the comparison is two people who have been indicted for the same offense, and one makes bail and he's out on the street, and the other doesn't make bail, and so he is in an institutional facility.  And the one who's out on the street has some kind of encounter with a police officer, and he reaches into his pocket to take out something, and the police officer shoots him.  And let's just imagine that circumstances are such that this is utterly unreasonable. And then the same -- the same person indicted for the same offense, not convicted of that offense, same circumstances, the police shoot him, now he's not going to be treated in any respect the same way.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Waxman, can I give you a hypothetical State system? And this is a two-part question.  You tell me if it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.  And if it is, what makes this case different.  Okay? So my system is that a jury, whether in the penalty phase or in the guilt phase, has to make a determination of an aggravating factor.  Okay.  But once that's done, once the jury decides on an aggravating factor, the judge can do whatever she wants.  The judge can add aggravating factors.  The judge can reweigh the aggravating factors as compared with the mitigating evidence.  The judge can do any of that stuff.  But the judge has to leave alone the aggravating factor that the jury finds.  So, in other words, the judge can't give death when the jury finds life, and the judge can't throw out the jury's factor.  But as long as that jury makes that aggravating factor, the judge can do anything that is consistent with the Sixth Amendment.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.   Elena Kagan  Well, is that -- is that what makes a difference, then, in the end, that -- that you're saying that the jury has to be specifically told that that's what it's doing?

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, you're saying it couldn't happen consistent with Ring, meaning that there are certain applications of the Florida law that would be unconstitutional even in your view.   Elena Kagan  Could I give you another hypothetical scheme, notwithstanding that we don't sit in judgment of hypothetical schemes?   Elena Kagan  Suppose that the -- the jury finds an aggravating fact, but then, you know, the judge has this whole separate hearing -- right? -- in which other things are presented to him.  And the judge says, You know, I don't actually agree with the aggravating fact that the jury found, but I have my own aggravating facts, and now I'm -- I'm doing all the weighing and I come out in favor of death. I -- I assume that you would say that that also would be an unconstitutional application.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  Quite -- quite right. But I'm -- I'm hypothesizing a case in which the jury finds that death-eligibility marker.   Elena Kagan  Right? If -- but the judge throws that one out and substitutes his own.  That -- you think that would be constitutional?   Elena Kagan  No, he does throw it out. He just says, I don't agree with that.  I'm -- but I'm substituting my own. Would that be all right?   Elena Kagan  But I have to say that answer surprises me because the death sentence there is not at all a function of the jury's eligibility finding. The judge has tossed out that eligibility finding and substituted his own, which then leads to the death sentence. So how can we say that that's possibly constitutional under Ring?   Elena Kagan  The judge has said that that jury finding is utterly irrelevant to his decision about whether to impose death.  That he's imposing death based on something that the jury has not found.   Elena Kagan  But the thing is you can't really tell whether that happens in a wide variety of cases.  And this is actually -- this goes to this question of because the jury doesn't actually have to find specific things, only the judge has to find specific things, you often are not going to be able to tell whether the judge's sentence is based on the same aggravating facts that the jury has found.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Which honestly sounds the same.   Elena Kagan  Can I go back to the kinds of hypotheticals that Justice Kennedy and I were -- were proposing. So let's say that there is a jury, and it's been presented with evidence that the murder was for pecuniary gain, which is one of the aggravating factors. And the -- the jury comes out with a recommendation of death.  So you -- and that was the only thing that was presented to it.  So you know that the jury has made a death eligibility determination on pecuniary gain.  Then it goes to the judge.  The judge says, you know what, I don't really think that there's enough evidence of pecuniary gain, but I've had this whole hearing, and I find that the thing was -- that the crime was heinous and whatnot, and now I'm going to sentence the person to death. Now, you say that that's fine; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, no -- no -- he's -- he's heard more evidence because, you know, there's a whole new hearing that he has.  And now he's considered it more thoroughly, and he thinks, no, I don't agree with that anymore, but I think it was heinous.  So that would be fine.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, yes, yes, it's not this case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm throwing out --   Elena Kagan  -- the jury's aggravating factor, but I'm substituting my own.  I thought that that was what you told me, that that was constitutional under Ring.   Elena Kagan  This wasn't at the guilt phase; this was just as a matter of sentencing. Let me get on with my questioning --   Elena Kagan  -- because I think you answered this one already.  Then the appeal that's taken, right -- the appeal is focusing now only on what the judge has found, isn't that right, under Florida law? The appeal -- if the person came in and said that there was insufficient evidence, the appeal would only be as to the judge's finding and not at all to the jury's.   Elena Kagan  And -- and he says there was just not enough evidence of all these aggravating factors, so -- but that was -- would only be as to the judge's aggravating factors.  It couldn't possibly be that he would challenge the jury's.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, I'm just suggesting that the whole appeal process suggests that the crucial death eligibility determination is being made by the judge because that's the only death eligibility determination that the appeals court is ever going to review.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, look, they have something to review.  The problem is it's the judge's thing to -- that they're reviewing, not the jury's, and that's a Sixth Amendment problem.

0,"Elena Kagan  What if there were 19 cases, Mr. Lamken, and Congress specified them all?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I guess what I'm asking --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess what I'm asking is what that means, ""a limited category."" Is the number irrelevant if Congress specifies them? I mean, Congress could specify a hundred.  Congress could --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could Congress do it --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could Congress do it the day before a lawsuit is filed? In other words, Congress knows that a lawsuit is going to be filed on a particular subject and just creates the rule for that lawsuit, but the lawsuit hadn't actually been commenced yet?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Suppose it weren't. Supposed it was like Congress amends the law so that assets held in Clearstream Citibank account is subject to execution by Deborah Peterson, before Deborah Peterson brought suit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that seems silly --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- Mr. Lamken, and that's why you've been saying that the number doesn't matter, and it doesn't matter whether it's the day before or the day after suit, and it doesn't matter if Congress has specified the docket number because any of those limitations, you would say, well, Congress could do, you know, pretty much the exact same thing except it would be in two cases, or except it would be without the docket number.  And your answers suggest how, you know, a little bit nonsensical those distinctions would be.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Why doesn't it make a difference that this is in the area of foreign affairs? I had thought that our cases were pretty clear that the political branches -- especially the executive, so I concede that there's a difference there -- but that the political branches have a great deal of power in this area, even when it comes to very particular controversies.   Elena Kagan  Suppose there's -- suppose Iran were holding a great many American hostages, and Iran said, we'll release these hostages if you stop execution in a suit like this.  And suppose Congress thought that that was a good deal and -- and said exactly that.   Elena Kagan  I'm not quite sure I understood that answer, and -- and you're -- you're suggesting that if Congress has a good reason to extinguish these claims, then Congress can do it, but if not, not.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  I said Congress passes a statute that basically --   Elena Kagan  -- affects this deal.

1,"Elena Kagan  Does that mean, Mr. Olson, if I could, you're conceding that Congress could not say, we have a particular case, Smith v. Jones, Smith ought to win? Congress cannot say that, right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, just under the straight separation of powers argument, that would be adjudicating if Congress said Smith wins in this case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I was giving you a simple hypothetical.  I thought that you already answered this, but maybe not.  Congress says, we see this case, Smith versus Jones.  Smith wins.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's no good.   Elena Kagan  So if that's right, now Congress takes a look at this case and says, we can't just say Smith wins.  And then we just -- we take a look at the case and we say, oh, if you just tweaked the law in this particular way, Smith would win.  So we tweak the law in this particular way for this case only.  But we don't say Smith wins.  We just say we're tweaking the law in this particular case for this case only.  Is that all right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But usually when we say that, we're talking about amending the law that has effect beyond the particular pending case.  And there we say, yes, absolutely, Congress can amend the law. Congress knew that it would affect these pending cases. No problem because Congress passed something, you know, that was within the scope of its legislative powers to amend law affecting this case and others. When you take out the ""and others,"" that seems to create a different kind of problem, one where Congress is doing our job rather than its own.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kneedler, do you -- do you agree with what Mr. Olson said, that Congress can't just pick a winner in a particular suit? Congress can't say Smith wins in this case --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.

1,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Konrad, can I make sure I understand this because, you know, I read that -- the part of the opinion that you're referring to and I just really couldn't figure it out. So is it that the court said, well, we don't know what the ceiling effect is generally, but the ceiling effect only goes to how something operates at the spinal cord level, it doesn't go to how it operates at the brain and this -- and -- this -- this takes -- what we -- what we care about is how it operates at the brain, so we don't even have to worry about ceiling effect; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that what the court said?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you're saying we do have to worry about the ceiling effect.  There isn't this dichotomy between the drug at the spinal cord and the drug at the brain, and the -- it's actually crucial what kind of ceiling effect this drug has in -- in contradiction to what the court said, which was we didn't have to worry about ceiling effect.  Is that --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that how it goes?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How do we know that? I thought that what we knew was something different.  I thought that what we knew was just what we can't know; in other words, that there's this huge range of uncertainty about what happens when somebody is -- is given this drug. You're suggesting something more than that, which is that we know what happens, we know that the drug can't maintain deep -- deep unconsciousness. Which -- which is right?   Elena Kagan  Well, I thought it wasn't used for that purpose just because we don't know whether it's capable of being used for that purpose, as opposed to we know it's incapable of being used for that purpose, if you see the difference.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Does the --   Elena Kagan  Does the fact that something is a lethal dose necessarily mean that it's not incredibly painful?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It could be a lethal dose and be incredibly painful.   Elena Kagan  Well, maybe to the extent that you can't --   Elena Kagan  Please, go ahead.   Elena Kagan  I guess the question I was asking was if a person was burned alive and we didn't know whether he had appropriate anesthesia, would that be unconstitutional, too?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because potassium chloride --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- is kind of like that, isn't it? It's being burned alive from the inside. That's what it is.   INTERRUPTING ",14-7955
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Wyrick, as -- as I understand it, there were three subsidiary findings that underlay this conclusion. The first is the one that we talked a little bit about with Ms. Konrad, which has to do with the ceiling effect, which, as I understand it you, don't at all defend. The second is the idea that 500 milligrams of this drug would likely kill a patient in 30 minutes or an hour, which seems to me irrelevant given that a lethal dose is completely consistent with unbearable pain. And the third is that that dose of midazolam would keep a patient unconscious while a needle is inserted into his thigh, which also seems irrelevant given the -- what everybody understands to be the much, much, much greater potential for pain of potassium chloride. So those were the three subsidiary findings. One of them nobody thinks is anything other than gobbledygook, and the other two are irrelevant.  Is that not the case?   Elena Kagan  Well, it does not sound pleasant to have a needle put in your thigh.  But when you read these descriptions of what midazolam does, that it gives the feeling of being burned alive, it sounds really considerably more than having a needle put in your thigh.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  I'm sorry. Potassium chloride.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There's --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  That's not -- that's not the point.  It's a lethal dose of potassium -- of midazolam, it will take 30 minutes to die.  In the meantime, the potassium chloride can be wreaking extraordinary pain on the individual.  So in that sense, the fact that this is a lethal dose of midazolam has nothing to do with the question that is before us, whether, before that 30 minutes or hour passes, the potassium chloride is wreaking unbearable pain on the individual.   Elena Kagan  They are pain relief medications.   Elena Kagan  You know --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There is --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There is the fact that this is a lethal dose, again, completely consistent with the possibility of potassium chloride causing great pain. There is the fact that it rendered -- it keeps a patient unconscious with a needle, completely consistent with it not keeping a patient unconscious with potassium chloride running through his body, and, again, this -- this statement that nobody can figure out about the ceiling fact.   Elena Kagan  But Mr. Wyrick, it would be very different if the court had said, look, we don't think you've presented enough evidence that the ceiling effect kicks in at this point, right? But that's not what the court said.  The court had this alternative theory, which is that it didn't have to concern itself with whether the ceiling effect had kicked in.  And that's the thing that not -- you don't defend as well. But that was what the court said.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  Whatever it might be, we don't have to worry about it because all we have to worry about is the brain and not the spinal cord, and in the brain, there is no ceiling effect.  And that's just wrong.  You know that's wrong.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I just read it -- I think if we go back and read it, it will show that what he was saying was we just don't have to worry about the ceiling effect because at the brain level, the ceiling effect has no relevance. Let me ask you another question.  Maybe this is one we'll agree on.  Maybe not.  I'm not sure. Do you think that if we conclude that there is just a lot of uncertainty about this drug, in other words, you know, you might be right, or Ms. Konrad might be right, and it's really just impossible to tell. Given that nobody does studies on this drug, it would be unethical to do studies on this drug, we simply can't know the answer to these questions.  If that's the state of the world, do you think it's a violation of the Eighth Amendment to use it?   Elena Kagan  No.  Well, you're just repeating the standard.  But I'm giving you a set of -- we just don't know.  It might be substantial pain; it might not be substantial pain.  I mean, we can't -- we can't -- we can't quantify it at all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess I'm not talking about burdens.  I'm talking about a district court who's presented with evidence.  Just put yourself in the position of a district judge.  And the evidence is who can tell? Nobody can tell.  What is a district court supposed to do at that point?   Elena Kagan  So then I think I have not found a place where I agree with you, because that seems -- that seems quite something to me.  I mean, that would be like saying -- people say that this potassium chloride, it's like being burned alive.  We've actually talked about being burned at the stake, and -- and everybody agrees that that's cruel and unusual punishment. So suppose that we said, we're going to burn you at the stake, but before we do, we're going to use an anesthetic of completely unknown properties and unknown effects.  Maybe you won't feel it, maybe you will.  We just can't tell.  And -- and you think that that would be okay.   Elena Kagan  No, I'm -- I'm saying, because you just don't know about the anesthesia.  Maybe the anesthesia will cover all that -- the pain of being burned at the stake or maybe it won't.  The court doesn't know.   Elena Kagan  Induction, but not maintenance.

Elena Kagan  Well, why would we --   Elena Kagan  But -- but I -- maybe I'm misunderstanding what you're saying.  You're saying there is no such uniform determination that they will exercise their discretion in a certain way, that they are insisting upon their discretion being discretionary. Is that correct? (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Can I just ask one more quick question about this.   Elena Kagan  You -- you made reference -- this is an issue that's being litigated in the Georgia courts, is that right, in the Eleventh Circuit?   Elena Kagan  This precise issue?   Elena Kagan  Thank you.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I'll -- I'll -- am I right that the issue that is being litigated is whether the Supreme Court review, in cases like this, is discretionary or not discretionary?   Elena Kagan  Me too. Can I -- can I go to the merits? Is that -- is that all right?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Unless other people -- Okay. Look.  You have a lot of new information here from these files that suggests that what the prosecutors were doing was looking at the African-American prospective jurors as a group, that they had basically said, we don't want any of these people.  Here is the one we want if we really have to take one.  But that there -- the -- all the evidence suggests a kind of singling out, which is the very antithesis of the Batson rule. So, you know, I mean -- well, isn't this as -- I'm just going to ask you: Isn't this as clear a Batson violation as a court is ever going to see?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But -- but Ms. Burton, wouldn't you agree, in a lot of these Batson cases, you'll have purported justifications, which they could support a valid peremptory strike, right? But that the question for a court is, well, but did they support this valid peremptory strike? In other words, what was the prosecutor thinking? Batson is a rule about purposeful discrimination, about intent. And so it doesn't really matter that there might have been a bunch of valid reasons out there, if the -- if it was clear that the prosecutor was thinking about race. You agree with that, right?   Elena Kagan  Yes, if his intent was to strike based on race, it doesn't matter that he could have had a different intent that would have supported a good peremptory strike.  And so the question of whether, you know, someone or other might have been properly struck by -- by a prosecutor isn't really the question. The question is on the total amount of evidence before us, including all these prosecutors' notes, what was going on with respect to each of these peremptory strikes. And then you have to deal with not just, oh, it could have been this or it could have been that, but you have to deal with all this information that what it really was, was they wanted to get the black people off the jury.   Elena Kagan  And Justice Scalia raises, of -- of course, a good point in the mine run of cases, but not in a case where all the evidence of intentional discrimination was not before the judge at the time.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, I mean, I think that that's exactly how the decision is framed, right? Because the decision talks about claims that are not reviewable due to res judicata.  It lists many, many, many claims, and then it lists a whole bunch of claims that are procedurally defaulted.  And then this is in a separate section, the Batson issue, and it's in a section that's with -- with all the other claims that there are merits determinations being made about. And the court is very clear, first sentence, last sentence.  First sentence: ""The court finds the prosecution did not violate Batson versus Kentucky."" Last sentence: ""On the merits the person, the"" -- ""the"" -- ""the Petitioner loses.""

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Zas, is it possible when you read these three terms, as you say, Congress might have meant to be just trying to pick up every conceivable State statute it could think of.  But it's possible also to think of these as the aggravated sexual abuse is the worst offense; the sexual abuse is the medium offense; and the abusive sexual conduct is actually somewhat a more minor offense, in other words, might include things that are not sexual abuse themselves.  Let's say indecent exposure or something like that. And if you understand the provisions in that way as sort of going from the top to the bottom and meant to pick up everything, then it would seem that the involving a minor or ward really ought to refer to all of them.  Right? That there's no reason why the involving a minor or ward would -- would refer only to the most minor offenses as the others.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Maybe I said that wrong.  I think I said the exact opposite of what I meant. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  What? If you read -- if you read them going -- going down, right -- well, what do you think would follow? (Laughter.)

What do you think follows from that?   Elena Kagan  But why would they be focused on Federal sexual abuse involving adults but not State sexual abuse involving adults?   Elena Kagan  No, but the -- the Federal predicate, the Section 109, I believe it is, does apply to adults as well.  So why would they be focused on adults with respect to Federal offenses but not with respect to State offenses?   ",14-8358
0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. O'Connell --   Elena Kagan  Well, could I ask about your -- your basic theory as to that, which, if I understand it, says the reason why we shouldn't worry about redundancy you create is because Congress just wanted to make absolutely clear that the sexual abuse was also sexual abuse involving somebody who couldn't consent.  That's basically your theory. And there is a very easy way to do that, and it would have completely made this -- I mean, made this a hundred percent clear.  Congress would just have said aggravated sexual abuse, sexual abuse, or sexual abuse involving a minor or ward.  And just by using the exact same language, it would have been clear, but the distinction was between sexual abuse and sexual abuse involving a minor or ward. But Congress doesn't do that, right? Congress changes the language of the third noun.  And that's what creates the puzzlement.  And -- and so it seems to me that your theory doesn't really cohere with the fact that this third term -- although, nobody can say exactly what it means that is different -- the third term is linguistically dissimilar from the second one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You're not suggesting this is just a scrivener's error, are you? That it was meant to be contact?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, can I go back to the -- to the language? You know, it's confusing language.  And I showed it to all my clerks and -- and basically said how would you read it.  And two came out on one side, and two came out on the other side.  But -- but I'm sort of left with this feeling that it -- we're not in -- in a situation where there are dueling canons. We actually might be in a situation where one canon trumps the other. I mean, you have this last-antecedent rule, and it's an important rule.  But it gives way when a certain -- when there is a certain quality to all the antecedents when they're all parallel and when the last modifier equally sensibly refers to them all, right? And that that's a situation, so that series-qualifier rule is in some sense a rule about when the last-antecedent rule doesn't apply. So I guess I would ask you to comment on that.   ",14-8358

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Shelley, can we go back to the sentence that you're relying on, because I have to admit I don't understand your reading.  The -- the sentence says -- and I'm taking out some unnecessary words.  It says, the agency shall forward payments to the clerk, singular, until the filing fees are paid. Now, that makes perfect sense if the filing fees are all in one case, going to a single clerk.  But if you're right and what they mean is the filing fees are in multiple cases, then it doesn't make sense to say that the agency shall forward payments to the clerk. The only way to make that sentence makes sense, if the filing fees are in multiple cases, is for Congress -- is for the statute to have read, the agency shall forward payments to many clerks or to several clerks seriatim. And that suggests not the per-prisoner approach, but the per-case approach.   Elena Kagan  But then -- so that -- that seems right, to make the sentence work the way you want it to work -- and this is the sentence you are relying on.  To make it work the way you want it to work, you have to add language to it.   Elena Kagan  Yes, I'm going to say, you know what, even as I look at that, even if you add that language, it still doesn't make sense.  ""The agency shall forward payment to the relevant clerk until multiple filing fees are paid."" It's just -- it doesn't -- the two halves of the sentence don't connect there.   Elena Kagan  Well, but Congress doesn't know that.  Congress thinks fees in a case, fees in a case.  So then it makes perfect sense.  Give the fees in a case to the clerk.

And I share his lack of understanding about how the BOP is actually doing this, given the language of the statute. The statute says, you know, ""shall forward payments each time the amount in the account exceeds $10."" So that suggests to me that if you're looking at an account with $10 and 1 cent, you make the next payment.  And I understand from your brief that that's not what the BOP is doing.  And how can the BOP be not doing that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that does raise -- I mean, as Mr. Shelley says, using that exact $50 number.

0,"Elena Kagan  But that's a merits question as to whether they're entitled to attorneys' fees.  If the question is complete -- you know, ""complete relief"" means what the plaintiff has asked for.  The plaintiff has asked for attorneys' fees here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if I could go back a little bit, Mr. Garre.  And this is, I think, the question that Justice Scalia started with. There are a number of things that you've said, well, he asked for it, but he's not entitled to it.  He asked for attorneys' fees, but he's not entitled to attorneys' fees.  And he asked for an injunction or declaratory relief, and he's not entitled to that.  And he asked for class certification, but he's not entitled to that, and so the case is moot. And the ""so the case is moot"" seems to me to be a non sequitur.  In other words, he's asked for these things, you haven't offered these things, and there's a dispute about whether he's entitled to these things. Now, you might be completely right as to the ""He's not entitled to attorneys' fees."" But that has to be adjudicated.  You can't -- a court can't just say, Oh, you've offered complete relief, because in his view you haven't offered complete relief, and that's what the litigation is all about.   Elena Kagan  A court can absolutely make that determination.  But the question is does the Court make that determination in the guise of a mootness motion?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Mr. Garre --   Elena Kagan  -- and this is very much along the same lines -- you know, you have an old English case.  You have these three cases in the '90s, 1890s, which were really about liabilities had -- that had already been satisfied, and the court said, it's already been satisfied, payment has already been made. But there's really no history at all -- and tender offers have existed for a long, long time.  There's no history at all of -- of saying that a tender offer moots a case, as opposed to the classic understanding, the common law understanding, of tender offers was that it created an incentive for parties, and that that was their purpose and that was their effect, was to incentivize parties to do something, but not to -- for -- not to provide a mechanism for a court just to throw out a case when a party decided that, for whatever reason, he thought that the tender offer was not good enough.   Elena Kagan  Well, but I -- I said that mootness is not the appropriate remedy in that case. The appropriate remedy in a case where it's absolutely clear that -- that the -- that the defendant has given -- has offered the plaintiff everything the plaintiff has asked for, which it's not in this case, but where it's absolutely clear where the defendant has offered everything that the plaintiff himself has asked for, the appropriate thing to do, in order to prevent wasteful litigation, is not to dismiss the case for mootness but to grant judgment in favor of the plaintiff.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it doesn't become moot, it's just been decided.  It's -- there's been an adjudication at that point.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There's nothing to dismiss.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Garre, both sides have these class action policy arguments, but it's important not to let those drive this pretty technical mootness question.  So if we could just take the class action arguments out of it. Just let's say that there's a plaintiff, and he claims 10,000 -- he wants $10,000 plus attorneys' fees, okay? And the defendant says, I'll give you $10,000. And the plaintiff says, no, I really want attorneys' fees too.  And the defendant says, no, you're not entitled to attorneys fees.  Plaintiff says, no, I think I am.  I'll -- I think I -- I'm going to reject your settlement offer. So you say at that point the Court can come in and say, oh, the case is moot.  Now, how is that possible?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There's a -- there's a contested question as to what one person owes another. The -- the defendant has said he doesn't want to accept this offer because he doesn't think it gives him everything that's entitled -- he's entitled to.  And the measure of complete relief has to be, at this stage, about what his complaint asks for.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Then you submit the case --   Elena Kagan  -- on the merits.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So it doesn't really depend on what the percentage chance is.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It could be certain, it could be less than certain, it could be a lot less than certain, as long as the employer says there's some chance, and I'm not going to hire, or promote, or fire, or whatever, because of that chance.

No absolute certainty and certainly Mr. Goldberg doesn't say anything about being Jewish, but the employer just operates on an assumption that he's Jewish, so no, he doesn't get the job.  Is that a violation?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That has got to be against the law, right? It doesn't matter whether the employer -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  It doesn't matter whether the employer knows it to an absolute certainty, right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the thing about my question was, is that what this statute does is to say that if you are, in fact, wearing a headscarf for religious reasons, that your neutral policy really doesn't matter, it only matters if you -- if there's an undue burden and you really can't make an accommodation, but except for that, it really doesn't matter.  You just have to hire me, even if I'm wearing a headscarf.  And so the fact that you don't know that I'm wearing a headscarf for religious reasons, that you only kind of assume that, because most people do wear headscarves for religious reasons, it shouldn't make any more difference than in the hypothetical that I gave.   Elena Kagan  But you're essentially saying that the problem with the rule is that it requires Abercrombie to engage in what might be thought of as an awkward conversation, to ask some questions. Now, people can disagree about whether one can ask those questions in a way that's awkward at all, but you're saying we should structure the whole legal system to make sure that there is no possibility of that awkward conversation ever taking place.  But the alternative to that rule is a rule where Abercrombie just gets to say, we're going to stereotype people and prevent them from getting jobs.  We'll never have the awkward conversation because we're just going to cut these people out and make sure that they never become Abercrombie employees. Now, between those two options, the option of using a stereotype to make sure that somebody never gets a job and using a stereotype to have an awkward conversation, which does this statute seem to think is the worst problem?

And your argument would work just fine if you dropped the word ""presumption""; isn't that right? And you just said that the anchoring effect of the Guidelines creates a reasonable probability that the outcome would be different in a case in which the Court initially thought that the range was different from what it turned out to be.  Sort of the end.  Who needs the word ""presumption""?   Elena Kagan  So I would think that the answer to Justice Kennedy's question is if the court of appeals really thinks it's not going to give relief because of the fourth prong, why would you bother remanding it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Why would -- why would the court of appeals bother remanding it? They could legitimately say it doesn't matter.  We're not going to remand it because whatever happens on remand, we're not going to give relief based on the fourth prong.  And if that's the case, why would the court of appeals remand it at all?

0,"Elena Kagan  But let's say that's right: Yes, the burden is on the defendant.  But does the defendant meet that burden by saying, look, there was a mistake in the Guidelines; we know that there's an anchoring effect.  That's what the Court said in Peugh. That anchoring effect creates a reasonable probability that the Court would have done something differently.   Elena Kagan  Well, haven't we already answered that question in Peugh? In Peugh, the question was whether the likelihood was going to rise to the level of a significant risk.  And we said yes.  If you're using the wrong range, there is a significant risk that you would have made a different decision. So significant risk actually seems higher to me than reasonable probability.  At least it's not demonstrably lower. So I would think that we've already said, if you're using the wrong range because of the anchoring effect of the range -- an anchoring effect that is kind of mandatory.  It's -- you know, we say that these Guidelines are advisory, but we insist that a judge begin with them. So if you're using the wrong range, there is a significant risk.

I mean, what in the database shows you, yes, this veteran's small business is capable of performing this contract in a reasonably effective way?   Elena Kagan  Well, what Justice -- what -- Justice Breyer raised a question about the way this statute is worded because it says, ""For purposes of meeting the goals."" And the goals are very low; the goals are 3 percent. So it seems odd for a statute to say for persons of meeting a 3-percent goal, you should do the following, which will lead to 90 percent.   Elena Kagan  How high?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That could be four percent.   Elena Kagan  No, it sounds like the government did very badly in meeting its goals.

But the statute just seems pretty clear.  Once you say that this is a contract, what you've said in your brief and right now.  And once you say that, it just -- the statute says, ""A contracting officer of the department shall award contracts on the basis of competition restricted to veterans' small businesses."" So that seems to kind of answer the case, whatever the policy identifications are.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's your own understanding of contract.  You just said this is --   Elena Kagan  -- contract.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But as I understand it, all of those contracts have a ""may"" in there.   Elena Kagan  Or almost all of them do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah, but -- but most of them have a ""may."" But here you have -- and -- and the ""shall""s, the one or two that there are, have really never been adjudicated by -- certainly by this Court.   Elena Kagan  So the question is, well, there we are.  We are, you know, for the first time deciding what this language means, and this language means that you shall award contracts on the basis of this restricted competition.

And the question that's raised by your position is why it would be the case that the Constitution requires something with respect to one apportionment that it prohibits with respect to another.   Elena Kagan  I'm -- I'm sorry.  Did I just understand you to say that you think that the -- the House apportionment rule is not clear?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Consovoy --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Consovoy, could I go back to the question that Justice Breyer raised and can -- stripped, if he'll permit me, of the Guarantee Clause, because the Fourteenth Amendment is actually quite -- you know, the framers of the Fourteenth Amendment explicitly considered this issue, and, you know, made a decision. So Senator Howard, who introduces the Amendment on behalf of the joint committee that drafts it, talks about these deliberations.  And he says the committee adopted numbers as the most just and satisfactory basis, and that's the principle upon which the Constitution itself was originally framed, referring back to the original drafting.  And then he says numbers, not voters; numbers, not property; this is the theory of the Constitution. Now, this is the theory of the Constitution as to one thing, which is not the thing that you are talking about.  This is the theory of the Constitution as to House apportionment. But again, I'll go back to this question. This is just a clear, explicit choice that was made about what it meant to -- to have equal representation with respect to that area.

0,"Elena Kagan   Mr. Scodro, I -- I just to say I read this differently, so you can tell me why I'm wrong. But I'm -- in the last column of the Seventh Circuit's opinion, so there are twice where the Seventh Circuit says what it thinks.  The first time it says, when after the arrest a particular person is not let go when he should be -- so it's after the initial seizure, and then the person is not let go, the Fourth Amendment gives way to the due process clause as a basis for challenging his detention. And then in the last paragraph it says, ""Once detention by reason of arrest turns into detention by reason of arraignment, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture."" So it seems to me that twice, the Seventh Circuit says very clearly that you have this Fourth Amendment claim until arraignment or legal process, and after that, the Fourth Amendment falls out of the picture. And at the very basic level, before you get into these questions of what's the accrual date or anything else, it seems that that's the thing that the Petitioner is saying is wrong, that the Fourth Amendment claim continues after arraignment or after legal process.  Now, when it accrues, when it doesn't accrue is a different question, but it's still a Fourth Amendment claim, and -- and -- and that's what the Seventh Circuit rejected.   Elena Kagan   Mr. Scodro, can I ask -- might be misunderstanding this, so you'll tell me if I am.  But it seems as though the position that you're taking now is diametrically opposed to the position that you took in the Seventh Circuit.  So I'll just read you something, and this is from oral argument, but my clerk tells me that this is what happened.  I think it is not a transcript, but maybe there is.  But at least this is what my clerk tells me happened at oral argument. Judge Rovner says there are ten other circuits that have now recognized this kind of claim, this kind of Fourth Amendment claim.  And she said, let's just assume that we do what those ten other circuits have done, which, of course, they didn't do, but she says let's just assume it. At what point would you think the statute of limitations would begin to run?  And then you -- or maybe not you, but you -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan   You say, well, if you to recognize such a claim --   Elena Kagan   -- the accrual is the at which the proceedings are terminated in favor of that individual. So in this case it would be -- I think the date would have been May 4, 2011. And then Chief Judge Woods says, so you're assuming that the constitutional tort would follow the same pattern that State law does and require the favorable termination, because if there's no favorable termination for all the policy reasons the States have considered, there's no injury. And again, whoever the lawyer was said, that's correct. So am I misunderstanding this, or are you saying that's not correct; that's wrong?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan   Is there no transcript this?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan   Oh, I don't think that's -- I mean, maybe, I guess.  I mean, it seems to me that the much more natural way of understanding this is to say, look, if we do what every other circuit has done in the sense that we acknowledge that there is a Fourth Amendment claim here, post-legal process, something which you yourself have now acknowledged today, that if we acknowledge that, what would the accrual date be?  And then the lawyer says the accrual date would be the date of termination.   Elena Kagan   And -- and now you're it wouldn't be.  And I actually don't know whether it should be or it shouldn't be.  I don't think the Seventh Circuit for a moment considered that question.  And I guess it's -- it's another reason why I think we should just send the whole thing back.  The Seventh Circuit can figure out whether you forfeited this claim.  The Seventh Circuit can figure out, if you didn't forfeit this claim, what the right answer is.  But to me, this language -- and I have not listened to the tape myself, so I have to admit that -- but to me, this language suggests that you forfeited this.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That really does make the -- the language something it's not.  Instead of the provisions of this chapter in 1346(b), that's what the provision says, you're essentially reading it to say Section 2674 of this chapter and Section 1346(b)  So that's a real shift in what the language actually says.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's a --   Elena Kagan  No, no, no.   Elena Kagan  We're all being so polite today.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  2679 is different, though, right?

1,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Katyal, that suggests that when Congress passed the FHA, it was looking only at individual acts of discrimination to particular persons.  But the FHA is a very peculiar and distinctive kind of anti-discrimination statute, which really is focusing on community harms, and we talked about this a lot in the Texas Housing case of a couple of years ago.  So it's not just individuals who are harmed; it's communities who are harmed.  And that's the basic idea of the entire statute, why Congress passed it. And here the cities are standing up and saying, every time you do this redlining and this reverse redlining, essentially a community is becoming blighted.  And who better than the City to recognize that interest and to assert it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but they are a person aggrieved under the -- given Congress' purposes in the Act, because they are saying, as you did this redlining, as you did this reverse redlining, our communities, the thing that makes us a city was becoming more and more blighted, and that's what we are trying to recover for, the -- the costs of responding to that, the -- the costs of not having revenues in order to carry out our services for that community and for others.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Not parens patriae.  This is their own interest in maintaining their communities free of the kind of racial discrimination that the Act says causes neighborhood blight.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  I guess I don't understand why this isn't a segregation harm.  Here, the City is saying, you've done this redlining; you've done this reverse redlining.  It's not that it just causes various foreclosures all over the City; it's causing foreclosures in particular concentrated areas, and it's doing that because of racial segregation. And at the same time, it's preventing that racial segregation from ever being lifted because those communities are becoming more and more blighted and less and less capable of becoming integrated communities.  So everything about this complaint is about racial segregation, it seems to me.   Elena Kagan  So do you think everything I just said, if their complaint was written like that, that they could maintain a suit?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal --   Elena Kagan  Can I ask a separate question? We've been talking a lot about zone of interests and the question about whether the zone-of-interest test applies at all. Because you have three cases prior to this 1988 re-enactment of the old 1968 language.  And in each of three cases -- in Trafficante, in Gladstone, in Havens -- the Court very specifically says that this language stretches to the limits of Article III. So Congress is amending the statute in 1988 against that backdrop.  Why shouldn't we understand that to mean that the language means it stretches to the limits of Article III?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm disabled from having thoughts on this subject.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand. I mean, we can argue about whether these were holdings and whether these were a dicta, and there are arguments on both sides of that. But here I am on Congress.  I mean, suppose you were an advisor to a congressman.  And the congressman said, okay.  I don't really like this idea of going to the limits of Article III.  I think we should limit it. You say, no worries.  Just use the same language. And he says, use the same language? That language has been consistently understood to go to the limits of Article III. And you say, oh, no.  Don't worry.  It's dicta. And he says, okay.  I feel relieved.  We can now use this language. I mean, wouldn't you be fired?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't read the -- the House Report that way.  The House Report does refer to a couple of particular aspects of those cases.  But the House Report seems to me to cut against you because it makes clear that Congress knew about those cases.  And those cases are, of course, the cases which said that standing stretches to the limits of Article III. And if you really look at the legislative history of this Act, it's pretty clear that when Congress is acting in 1988, it took off the shelf a bill that was discussed in 1980.  And in that bill, there was a lot of discussion about whether standing should go to the limits of Article III.  And Congress was thinking of changing that language. And Drew Days, the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, and the HUD Secretary, they both come in and they tell Congress, if you change that language, it's a problem, because then you're cutting back on standing.  And Congress decided not to change that language because it wanted, as Drew Days said and as the HUD Secretary said, to go to the limits of Article III.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  When you say that -- when you said to me that the complaints that I wrote would have been covered by the Act, do you think it also would fall within proximate-cause principles?   Elena Kagan  But is one understanding -- like, I guess, when I started reading the briefs, I was confused about this, because there's one understanding of proximate cause, which is that usually proximate cause is about foreseeability and only foreseeability. Now, there are definitely places where we've said there's this additional directness requirement, but only in pretty discrete areas.  And I guess I -- like I sort of come back to this notion that I think what our -- our precedent suggests is it's a little bit statute by statute as to whether proximate cause is a foreseeability inquiry and only that, or whether it has additional components.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's a very broad statement, Mr. Gannon.  What do you do, then, with the restaurant or the dry cleaner or the laundry or whatever that wants to sue for somebody else's discrimination?   Curtis E. Gannon  Well, I agree with my friends on both sides that that limit is going to come from the proximate-cause analysis.  We don't disagree that there is still a proximate-cause limitation implicit in the statutes. And here we think that although Gladstone didn't address proximate cause in those terms, it is important and significant that the Court there said that the City is directly injured by the decrease in property values, and we think that the test -- the ultimate test that this Court stated in Lexmark -- of course, the Court has repeatedly recognized that proximate cause is a statute-by-statute situational inquiry that depends upon the nature of the individual statutes, but the ultimate test is whether there is a sufficiently close connection to the conduct that the statute prohibits. And what this statute prohibits is discriminatory housing practices.   Elena Kagan  Perhaps -- please.   ",15-1111

Elena Kagan  You're quite right, Mr. Kneedler, but there is a difference between this case and I think -- I think all -- maybe all but one -- of these other cases, which is in all of these others, the Court has been able to point to some alternative remedy.  It might not have been the complete relief that a plaintiff in a case wanted, but it was something.  And there was an ability to say, Congress has given you some way to address the harm that you've suffered. And here, there really is nothing.  I mean, there's the idea that you might prosecute this person criminally, but what does the family get from that? And anyway, you almost never do. So -- so here, there's just no remedy.  And isn't that really quite different from all these other Bivens cases that you referred to?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, we said that, but, you know, Stanley might be the only case on your side.  And Stanley is a military case where there is like the ultimate special factor.  So for the most part, every time we've said no Bivens, we've said because there's an alternative remedy.  And here we can't say that.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kneedler, you -- Mr Kneedler: -- for private confirmations.   Elena Kagan  -- you get the point.  The point of it is that it's the heartland of Bivens for a law enforcement officer to use deadly force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  That's the heartland of Bivens.  We don't have to make up anything new.  We don't have to extend it.  We don't have to create anything.  That's just Bivens.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, could you say -- let's talk about that.  How is this fraught with foreign relations issues? Because Mexico would surely prefer that -- that its citizen have a Bivens remedy. So you seem to be using foreign relations as if sort of this touches some other country.  But in the usual case, I think we've asked what's the interference? What's the disruption? So tell me what the interference or the disruption is.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The problem we would create --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- not just the fact that it has something to do with another country.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sure Mexico cared a lot about this.  The question I'm asking is how does the presence of the Bivens remedy disrupt or interfere with the United States' ability to carry out its foreign policy?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sure it wouldn't have to be written that way. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING ",15-118X
1,"Elena Kagan  But why do we look, Mr. Kneedler, to the moment of birth? Why shouldn't we look to the moment when citizenship is sought?   Elena Kagan  Why couldn't that have been done, Mr. Kneedler? Why couldn't these objectives have been served through entirely gender neutral language? For example, I know that there was a proposal that the Secretary of State made earlier than this statute was passed in the 1930s, which talked just about legal parents, which didn't refer to mothers and fathers at all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That would get rid of the gender inequality that is at the heart of his complaint. Whether or not he in the end benefits from it, the question here is whether the statute makes -- constitutes a violation of equal protection. One question we ask when we think about a question like that is, could Congress have written the statute? Could Congress have served its objectives in an entirely gender neutral way? And it seems as though here we have the -- the Secretary of State presented a statute to Congress that actually did that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could I -- I'm sorry.  Were you finished?   Elena Kagan  Could I -- I mean, we generally have a rule that when we find an equal protection violation, we level up rather than level down.  That's been the Court's consistent practice. Wouldn't you agree?   Elena Kagan  Well, I find one compelling reason to do it -- and I just thought I'd offer this up to you and see what you have to say -- is that in this case, unlike in some cases, there really isn't a choice between leveling up and leveling down in one sense, because if you level down, this party gets no relief. In other words, you say, well, you level -- you just apply it prospectively.  But then this party gets absolutely no relief.  And so isn't that a problem? Isn't it the kind of the same problem as Justice Harlan recognized in -- in Welsh when he was dealing with a criminal matter? He said, you know, you can't level down because you can't give everybody the exact same benefit. So how do we deal with that?   Elena Kagan  But not really a situation like this.  Not a situation where we say, uh, there is an equal protection violation, and if we extend the benefit to everybody, we can take care of that equal protection violation, we can remedy the problem.  But if we do not, if we try to level down, the effect of that is that the -- the party before us who has proved an equal protection violation gets absolutely no relief at all.   ",15-1191
0,"Elena Kagan  I mean, the problem, isn't it, Mr. Broome, that the very inequality that you are complaining of would remain, because it's impossible to claw back everybody else's citizenship, so it's really impossible to level down.  And the very inequality that we've just found would remain.   Elena Kagan  But it's not just that it doesn't give you citizenship, it's that it doesn't cure the inequality at all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Either by leveling down or by leveling up.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kneedler --   Elena Kagan  But before you -- before you do that, Mr. Broome, just on the remedy question, very occasionally this Court has faced a situation when the natural remedy of something that it is holding.  We were concerned a little bit about how -- whether Congress would prefer a different remedy. So, for example, in the Northern Pipeline case, what we did in a situation like that was we stayed our judgment for a period of time and allowed Congress essentially to do it a different way if it wanted to. And I'm wondering whether you had considered that possibility here, that we could order a kind of leveling-up judgment but stay it for some period of time so that Congress could decide whether it instead preferred some other way of dealing with the problem, whether that would be appropriate?

It doesn't have the capacity to check message-by-message or click-by-click what a person is doing.  And in the absence of that, that some kind of prophylactic remedy is needed. And that's not unheard of in First Amendment law.  I mean, if you think of a case like Burson, which is the 50 feet with --   Elena Kagan  -- in the polling places, that's kind of a prophylactic rule.  So why wouldn't the same be appropriate here?

Elena Kagan  So -- so a -- so a person in this situation, for example, cannot go onto the President's Twitter account to find out what the President is saying today?   Elena Kagan  Not only the President.  I mean, we're sort of aware of it because the President now uses Twitter.  But in fact, everybody uses Twitter. All 50 governors, all 100 senators, every member of the House has a Twitter account.  So this has become a crucial -- crucially important channel of political communication.  And a person couldn't go onto those sites and find out what these members of our government are thinking or saying or doing; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But -- but -- I mean, yes, that narrows it.  It -- it takes the nytimes.com out of the statute, but it doesn't take the sites that people use today, as I suggested -- whether it's Twitter or whether it's Facebook -- which have become incredibly important parts of our political culture, of our religious culture. If you ask, there are surveys that say how many Americans have communicated their faith on social networking sites in the -- in the past week, and it turns out that one in five.  That's about 50 million Americans use this for religious community purposes. So whether it's political community, whether it's religious community, I mean, these sites have become embedded in our culture as ways to communicate and ways to exercise our constitutional rights, haven't they?   Elena Kagan  But you're not making a conduct speech distinction, are you? I thought you had dropped that in your briefs.   Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Montgomery, can I ask you a question that has to do with the law's exemptions? Because it just confused me when I was reading it.  It seems that some -- some of what's exempted by the law seems, I have to say, some of the most dangerous stuff.  So you exempt any website that provides only a chat room or only photo sharing.  So why is that? Because if I would have said, like, where the most dangerous activity takes place, it's in chat rooms and via photo sharing.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It just seems to exempt the stuff that's most easily used to -- to do exactly the things that this statute is meant to prevent.   Elena Kagan  When you just said to Justice Ginsburg, well, maybe that would be unconstitutional if they included these things that are instead exempted, so you mean that there's a constitutional right to use Snapchat, but not to use Twitter?   Elena Kagan  Well, I would have -- I would have thought that Snapchat is -- is -- maybe I have it wrong.  I'm not any expert on this.  But isn't Snapchat photo sharing?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah.  So that falls under the exemption; right? So you can use Snapchat, but you can't use Twitter?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Montgomery, I agree with you.  That's your closest case.  It's the one that I asked Mr. Goldberg about, because it's the only case that I know of where we've permitted a prophylactic rule where we've said not all conduct will have these dangerous effects, but we don't exactly know how to separate out the dangerous -- dangerous speech from the not-dangerous speech, so we're going to have a prophylactic rule.  That is like one out of a zillion First Amendment cases that we've decided in our history. And as Justice Kennedy says, there are many reasons to think it's distinguishable from this one.   Elena Kagan  How many people under 30 do you think don't use these sites to get all their information? Under 35? I mean, they're -- increasingly, this is the way people get everything that -- all information.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  This is the way people structure their civic community life.   Elena Kagan  Where is that in the statute? Because I don't read the statute to impose that as a requirement.  So tell me where you find that.   Elena Kagan  Right.  So (B)(iii).   Elena Kagan  It -- it allows users to create web pages or personal profiles that contain information such as links to other personal web pages. So you're reading the ""such as"" as a requirement, but ""such as"" is not a requirement.  ""Such as"" is just like here's an example, but you don't necessarily need this.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, then you need an implied colon and an implied semicolon.   Elena Kagan  And then another implied semicolon.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And then another implied semicolon.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But all this implying of punctuation marks, I mean, if you just read this, it's contain information such as a bunch of things, which none of which are necessary, but these are good examples of things that characterize allowing users to create web pages or personal profiles that contain information.

0,"Elena Kagan  General Gershengorn, can I ask: As you read this statute, suppose you just took out these words ""notwithstanding Section"" -- ""Subsection (a)(1)."" What would then the effect of the statute be?   Elena Kagan  But just focusing on text for a minute.   Elena Kagan  If that's true, if the entire textual argument really does rest on the ""notwithstanding Subsection (a)(1)"" -- I mean, typically when you have a ""notwithstanding"" clause, it means, you know, take away Subsection (a)(1), not, you know, close your eyes to Subsection (a)(1)  But it doesn't do anything more than that. So why do you think it should be taken to do something more than that in this case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But can I give you a hypo?   Elena Kagan  So the hypo is, I'm at a restaurant, and I -- I'm talking to my waiter, and I place three orders.  I say, number 1, I'll have the house salad.  Number two, I'll have the steak.  Number three, I'll have the fruit cup.  And then I tell the waiter, notwithstanding order number three, I can't eat anything with strawberries. So on your theory, the waiter could bring me a house salad with strawberries in it, and that seems to me a quite odd interpretation of what's a pretty clear instruction: No strawberries.   Elena Kagan  So I -- I take it, you know, you have some arguments, some strong arguments on -- on history and on practice, but, you know, again, I'm just sort of -- isn't that just a peculiar way to understand the, you know, notwithstanding order number three, no strawberries?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can I ask you about the consequences going backward?   Elena Kagan  Your brief did not talk about this, but do you think that if we find against you, that that subjects to some uncertainty actions that these 100-plus officials took?   Elena Kagan  If so, what actions?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Suppose you didn't have those defenses, because, you know, I'm not sure why you would necessarily, given that the statute says they're void ab initio if people take it as against these procedures.  So if you didn't have those defenses, as you look down the list of these officials, what kinds of actions are you most worried about being unsettled?   Elena Kagan  Can I just press you a little bit?   Elena Kagan  I mean, those are all very important positions that you named, but it's not absolutely clear to me that those -- that there are categories of decisions that those people take that we should be worried about.  And if there are, I would like to know about those categories of decisions.   Elena Kagan  Well, why do you -- why and how do you think that that change was made, then? Because the change clearly was made.  In the initial draft, it obviously applied only to first assistants; and then in the final draft, not so obvious at all. And, you know, I agree with you there's no explanation, but there is a change. Are you suggesting it was, you know, just a mistake that somehow happened?   ",15-1251
1,"Elena Kagan  I don't get that, Mr. Dvoretzky.  And maybe this follows the government's line of thought, but, you know, I've been -- the (a)(1) says, ""The first assistant shall be the acting officer."" And then (b)(1) says, no, she may not be.  Right? And (a)(2) and (a)(3) doesn't use the words ""shall,"" but it says, the President may appoint any of these people. And then (b) comes along and says, no, the President can't appoint some subset of them. So the basic conflict seems to me to be the same in both cases, which is that the second clause says not so fast, not with respect to those people.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But those grants of discretion are very broad, and then (b)(1) again takes the person out, takes the person out of the grant of discretion, just as it takes the person out of the self-executing provision before them.   Elena Kagan  I have to say, I find it a little bit odd to think of this drafter thinking of the kind of distinction you're making.  Say, well, this is self-executing and this is not self-executing.  It's only a broad grant of discretion.  And then not realizing that just by virtue of saying ""notwithstanding (a)(1),"" the statute creates -- raises this question about, well, you've said (a)(1) but not (a)(2) or (a)(3)  What does that mean? I mean, that seems just like a very strange drafter to me, somebody who is so in the weeds that they can't figure out that pretty obvious objection to what they're doing.   Elena Kagan  Can I ask Mr. Dvoretzky about the post-enactment history? Because, you know, we're generally reluctant to demand that Congress objects to things. But on the other hand, the -- the history here is so strong.  All of these appointments, 100-plus of them, in a time when Congress and the President -- I mean, this is -- this has been a time where there's been a lot of partisan bickering over appointments, and you would think that in that context, if anybody had thought that this statute could be read differently, we would have heard about it, and yet we hear absolutely nothing. So how do you explain that?   Elena Kagan  I don't know.  Wouldn't you say something like I don't like this nominee, and anyway, it's illegal for the President to make this nomination?   Elena Kagan  Seems like it gives it some real extra oomph, right? (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  It's not just -- it's not just a matter of my preferences versus the government's preferences.  Now the President's preference is illegal. It's off the board.  Congress has said he can't do it. Who wouldn't say that in that circumstance?

1,"Elena Kagan  If that's right, and this is the basic argument, it's our money by virtue of State law, and once the conviction disappears, why doesn't the State have to proactively return the money? In other words, why is it even required for the person to bring any kind of refund action against the State?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So your complaint is not to the nature of this action and to exactly what you have to prove.  You're saying that as soon as the conviction is vacated, the State has to put a check in the mail.   Elena Kagan  No.  I guess I'm asking, if your theory is right, why is even that necessary? If your theory is right, it seems -- I mean, you know -- you know, you might file a motion because the State hasn't done what it's supposed to do, but it seems as though the obligation on the State's part is immediately to put a check in the mail.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it -- it seems, Mr. Banner, that you could be approaching this in two ways.  I mean, one is you could be claiming a substantive due-process right along the lines that Colorado said you were doing, and then you came back and said no.  Now, if you were suggesting that you had a substantive due-process right, then surely tradition would be important.   Elena Kagan  But in -- if you're looking at procedural due process, I would have thought that your argument is the simple one of: This is property under State law; it's -- it's my property, it's your client's property.  And then we apply the Mathews test to determine what kind of procedure is due --   Elena Kagan  -- to get that property back.  And tradition --   Elena Kagan  -- wouldn't be any part of that.   Elena Kagan  What do States generally do if they've collected this money, they've paid it out to the victim, and then the conviction is overturned? Do they usually leave the money with the victim and just take it out of their general treasury, or do States try to take it back from the victim?   ",15-1256
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, I think that that's just mistaken, General.  They're saying that they have a general State law property right in the money. Now, do you disagree with that? Do you think that this is their money?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Whose money is it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why is it the State's money?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it's -- it's money that's conditioned on a valid conviction.  And when that valid conviction goes away, it seems the most natural, obvious thing in the world to say that the State's right to that money evaporates at exactly the same moment. Why isn't that true?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm not talking about due process.  I'm merely just talking about whose money it is.  Under State law, State property law, whose money is it? They say it's their money because there's no longer a valid conviction.  You say notwithstanding that the valid conviction has been reversed, it's the State's money.  I want to know why.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could you just sort of describe to me in sort of common sensical terms, you know, rather than point me to a sovereign immunity case or something, just in common sensical terms why is this the State's money?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  General, can I go back to what -- I'm sorry.  I interrupted you midstream.   Elena Kagan  That's the -- you said ""that's the question"" as though something big was coming up. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So you said to Justice Sotomayor, you said we agree that if this were their money, we would have to refund it in normal ways consistent with procedural due process.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So it really all does depend on whether we think it's their money or it's your money.   Elena Kagan  So if this were your money on this -- on the simple theory of, there once was a conviction, it once was valid, we collected the money at that time, and that makes it our money going forward forever and ever, no matter what happens to the conviction.  If that's your theory, it's not only true, as the Chief Justice said, that you wouldn't have to provide any remedy or any process for getting that money back; right? You could just keep it and say, doesn't -- you can prove your innocence, you cannot prove your innocence.  Too bad.  It's our money.  You agree with that.  I think you said that to the Chief.   Elena Kagan  And it would also be true, I would think, that even if that conviction were improperly gained, not just in the sense that it was later vacated, but let's say it was the State's fault that that conviction occurred; in other words, let's say, oh, I don't know, there was a Brady violation or something like that.  It would still be your money.   Elena Kagan  General, you said a couple of times that if -- if we were to look at this as this is not public property once the conviction is vacated, that instead it once again becomes the criminal defendant's property, the acquitted defendant's property, if that were true what kind of procedure would you have to set up to return the property, do you think?

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, that passage in -- in Cromartie II says in a case like this one. And -- and it's pretty clearly following off analysis of -- in a case with purely circumstantial evidence, rather than direct evidence of race-based districting. I think you would have heard it, and it would have sounded different if the Court had really meant that in every case where the question was, is this politics or is this race, there was a requirement to present maps.  That passage just would have read a lot differently.   Elena Kagan  Well, the question is: Is it? Right? I mean, that's the question that the district court was trying to answer.  Is it politics or is it race? If it's politics, it's fine; if it's race, it's not. And -- and so let's just take a hypothetical.  Not this case, but let's take a hypothetical, which is: A State really does decide to do race-based districting.  Says, we want to segregate all the African-American voters; this is the way we want to do it.  But then they say, well, we'll -- we'll -- we'll justify it based on politics, because that sounds better, right? So -- and -- but -- but there's lots of direct evidence that, in fact, the justification is politics, but the true reason is race. Now, were you suggesting when you stood -- when -- when -- in -- in -- in your -- in your first statements there, were you suggesting that even if a plaintiff comes in and has all this direct evidence that they are really trying to do race, that the plaintiff has to present its own maps?   Elena Kagan  But it's also a big thing to ask plaintiffs to come in with their own maps, if they have direct evidence that the State is doing race-based rather than politics-based districting.   Elena Kagan  Not so easy, because we know that race and politics correlate.  And the question is -- is not -- I mean, that's just a fact of the matter.  But we've said, notwithstanding that, if race is your motive, you get one result; and if politics is your motive, you get another result. So these maps are actually hard to do, given the extent of correlation there is, but direct evidence of race-based -- which, I have to say, there really is some in this case, because the principal line-drawer says, they told me to get above 50 percent BVAP -- direct evidence, you know, that basically makes the case for somebody.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But isn't -- isn't it --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Isn't there substantial evidence that Congressman Watt comes in and he sits on the witness stand and he says, I had a conversation with the map drawer and the map drawer said that my bosses told me I have to get up over 50.1 percent black votes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That seems like substantial evidence.  A Congressman says -- reports on a direct conversation he's had with the map drawer, who -- who -- who says he has received orders from on high.  And --   Elena Kagan  What do you mean, you would have --   Elena Kagan  What is your view of when maps should be required?   Nicole A. Saharsky  So we don't read the Court's decision in Cromartie II to require a map any time a political motive is asserted.  We take the Court at its word in a case like this one, and that was a case of circumstantial evidence of race.  There really was very little direct evidence of race.  The Court even put ""direct"" in quotes because it thought the direct evidence was so insubstantial. But there was strong evidence of politics and a correlation between race and politics.  So when you have the strong evidence of politics, little evidence of race, and the correlation, then we think it made sense in the context of that particular case for the Court to say, particularly since the maps were put in.  Like, give us a -- give us an alternative that really shows this. But when you have a case, conversely, which is a strong direct evidence of a racially predominant motive, it just doesn't make sense to require the map, because what the Equal Protection Clause gives you is -- is not having race being used for an unjustified reason. It's not -- the map isn't a per se.  It's just the map. It's just an evidentiary thing that you could have or not have.  It's one type of evidence.   Elena Kagan  But I think they would -- they did present both theories.  They said, proposed findings in McCrory, that it was purposely -- they purposely included a substantial number of African-American residents of Guilford County in CD12. The intentional placement of a significant number of black voters within CD12 establishes racial predominance.   INTERRUPTING ",15-1262

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Katsas, can I ask a question that -- this is an analytical question, not necessarily at all an argument that your result is wrong, but I -- I guess I'm confused by what you said now and what you say in the briefs that this is a matter of looking to the focus of the statute, because my understanding of Morrison is that this whole focus inquiry came in at the second step of the analysis. In other words, once the Court had decided that the presumption against extraterritoriality had not been rebutted, then there was an additional argument that had been made like, oh, this really does involve domestic conduct.  And so the Court used this focus test to decide whether it was the domestic conduct or the extraterritorial conduct that was the focus of the statute.  But that doesn't seem to answer the question whether the presumption is rebutted at all, and it doesn't seem to answer the question that I think you're trying to get at, and it's an important question, as to whether we look at that presumption question section by section or for the statute as a whole.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I -- I guess I just would have thought that the question is whether these are discrete provisions in some way such that a conclusion is to the extraterritoriality of one doesn't really effect -- doesn't tell you anything about the extraterritoriality of the other.  And it seems much less important as to what the focus of the statute as a whole is even if, you know, one could -- if one could answer that question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that may have been true, or largely true at the beginning, but how about all these amendments that happened after 9/11 which clearly seemed focus on foreign conduct, foreign organization, foreign harm?   Elena Kagan  Well, possibly they have some domestic application.  But if you ask, but why did Congress pass this amendment at this particular moment in time, what was -- I mean, recognizing that it's sometimes hard to figure out what was in people's heads, I mean, don't you think that what was in Congress's heads at that moment in time was foreign terrorist organizations committing terrorist conduct on foreign soil?   Elena Kagan  Well, this just means --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- foreign organizations, even as to that.   Elena Kagan  That at least suggests foreign organizations.   Elena Kagan  Well, the --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, the whole point of RICO is that it does both.  It says ""a pattern of conduct,"" and it links that pattern of conduct to the enterprise.  And it seems to be, you know, a little bit of a fool's errand to decide which the focus is, when -- when RICO is clearly something that melds the two and says there is a pattern of conduct and it relates in various kinds of ways to an enterprise.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the fact that some things can be separated doesn't mean that everything can be separated.  And the question is, how is it possible to understand RICO except as something in which these things are intermelded, and at the very least that -- one is not prior to the other or more important than the other. I mean, if we are going by our cases, we've said about a hundred times that it's the predicate acts that are -- that are the foundation of RICO.   Elena Kagan  Ms. -- please.  Sorry.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Well, all -- I was just going to say that in addition to comity concerns, I think there are other things that point in the direction --   Elena Kagan  Well, then, can I interrupt and talk about your comity concerns, because I understand them.  I mean, they seem very important.  But once you say that the presumption against extraterritorial is rebutted, on both the pattern of racketeering and the enterprise, once you say that, then drawing the line where you draw it seems to be very policyish.  There doesn't seem to be a whole lot of law behind it.  So I want to give you an opportunity to make it as law-like as you can, drawing the line here.   Elaine J. Goldenberg  Sure.  There are a number of things, I think.  One is that just on the face of the provisions, you can see that Section 1964(c) is not co-extensive with -- with Section 1962.  Congress chose to provide for recovery only for injury to business or property, not for personal injury, even though many of these predicates might be likely to cause personal injury. In addition to that, I think you have the comity concerns, which are an important underpinning of the presumption against extraterritoriality.  And as Petitioner's counsel pointed out, you do have this background common law rule that the place of injury is going to be the place where -- that -- that's going to have the law govern whatever injury you're talking about rather than the law of some the other jurisdiction.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. -- Mr. Frederick, I understand that argument with respect to what's the ordinary remedial provision of a statute.  But this is something a little bit more than that, right? Because this statute also -- this provision also includes substantive elements that don't apply except in the civil suit for damages.  Isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  So why doesn't that make the difference?   ",15-138X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Gupta, what -- what speech precisely do you think is being restricted?   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess that's why I said like what speech precisely, and you said the message that you're going to pay more if you use a credit card.   Elena Kagan  But, you know, as -- this -- this statute is not written in terms of speech, it's -- it's written in terms of imposing a surcharge.  And -- and let's say that somebody -- let's say that there is a merchant and the merchant charges the list price for something as a dollar and the person comes up to the cash register and offers a dollar bill.   Elena Kagan  And -- and the cashier says, oh, no.  For you it's 95 cents because I impose a surcharge for people who use credit cards; right?   Elena Kagan  Now, would that violate this law?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You don't know? How would it violate the law?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You don't think it would.   Elena Kagan  Even though you're describing something as a surcharge.  Because -- the reason it wouldn't violate the law is because the conduct is, you know -- it -- it fits the law, right, that essentially you're not imposing a surcharge on credit card users.  Whatever you call it, however you describe it, you're not imposing a surcharge on credit card users.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  See, that's what you keep -- you -- you said that again --   Elena Kagan  -- and I think my hypothetical was designed to show that that's just not right. I mean, I can imagine ways in which you might say that this is restricting speech, but that's not it.  Because as long as the price listed is the higher price, is the price that a credit card company has to pay, as long as that's true, you can describe it any which way you please.  And you can describe it in terms of impose -- of -- of imposing a surcharge or charging credit card customers more, and it still is not going to violate this law.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Gupta, this exchange -- I mean, I think that these are two very different theories of what makes this a speech restriction.  And I guess the reason I asked my question was because Justice Alito's theory does not appear to be your theory, and I want to know which theory we're really talking about here. Justice Alito's theory is that when the legislation says you have to post the higher price, that that in itself is a restriction on speech.  And that's an interesting argument, and maybe he's right about that.  I don't know. Now, your brief took a different position. Your brief essentially said the problem is that this -- this -- this legislation affects the way a cashier or somebody in a store -- just affects -- it affects the way they describe transactions generally, you know, and the cashier is going to be worried that she can't say to the customer, you charge more if you use a credit card. And I guess I wanted to know, which theory is your theory?   Elena Kagan  The latter one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Gupta, you're putting really a lot of emphasis on a few cases in which prosecutors describe the law in a certain way.  But the law as written doesn't really do any of the things that you're saying.  I mean, Justice Alito is right.  The law as written actually can be read -- and Justice Sotomayor said this before -- as just requiring a single price. Now, that's something that none of the parties here say, but if you just look at the law, that's what the law says.   Elena Kagan  Let's take that out of the picture.  Even then the law can say, the only thing that we are requiring is that you list the higher price. That's the only thing that we are requiring.  And then you can describe what you're doing any way you like. You can use the word ""surcharge."" You can use the word ""more."" You can use the word ""less."" You can use the word ""discount."" It doesn't matter.  So long as you list the higher price, you're in the clear.  And that, too, is very different from what you're saying, maybe from what the prosecutor said.  But just the way you read this law, it just doesn't give -- I mean, what these prosecutors say don't match what the law says.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The law says, you know, this is all about listing, you know, conduct; what you can charge.   Elena Kagan  Well, New York is saying in its brief that that's not the case; that you can say what you want to say; that you can call this a surcharge; that you can communicate in the way you want to communicate as long as your listed price is the -- is the credit card price.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  You said something very interesting.   Elena Kagan  You said if you take the statute, if you understand the statute to just mean that the listed price has to be the credit card price, that looks like a disclosure regime.  Could you explain that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And -- and your understanding of why it is a speech regulation, it -- is because it affects the way you list prices; is that right?   Eric J. Feigin  That's right, Your Honor. So a law, for example, that simply required a merchant who made a particular representation that the price of this item is $1.95 and required that merchant to honor -- and that was all the merchant said, didn't say anything about surcharges at all, and the law simply required the merchant to honor that price when the consumer gets to the cash register, that's an economic regulation.  That's just a regulation that is regulating pricing or contract offers, but the -- the law here, I think everyone agrees, does something a little bit more. In Options B and C that I was just discussing with Justice Sotomayor, you can have a price tag that does reveal a -- the existence of a surcharge expressed as a mathematical formula and the law would say that's not good enough, you have to actually list it as a price.   Elena Kagan  Well, isn't the idea, Mr. Feigin, that if you said 32.46 plus 2 percent, then you really are requiring people to do some work and you'd rather just have them know that it's -- see, I can't do it that fast. (Laughter.)   Eric J. Feigin  Well, Your Honor, you might also -- you can see that --   Elena Kagan  Could I -- I feel it -- I'm sorry.   Eric J. Feigin  -- and it makes for comparison pricing much easier.   Elena Kagan  Can I ask you a different question? It -- it does -- this does not look like a disclosure requirement.  It just -- I mean, one way to understand this is exactly what you said.  It -- it requires disclosure.  Whether everybody needs that disclosure, whether only a few people need that disclosure in the $10.20 case, but it requires disclosure to make sure that everybody is on the same page in terms of knowing prices. But if you look at the language of the statute, it just doesn't look like that.  And -- and if we're going to say that something is a disclosure requirement and so subject to a lesser forum of First Amendment review, shouldn't the State be making clear that that's what this is?   Eric J. Feigin  You're -- may -- may I answer --   ",15-1391
0,"Elena Kagan  But, you know, there does seem to have been a debate about what this statute means.  Because I look at some of this enforcement history and I think -- I don't really understand why this violates that law.  And, in fact, you've walked away from some of that enforcement history in your briefing and said, look, the cashier can call it whatever she wants to call it as long as the listed price is the credit card price.  But that is contradicting some of this enforcement history where a different understanding of this law was used. So how do we deal with that?   Elena Kagan  I mean, here's the narrow way in which this seems to affect communication, speech. I'm a seller.  I set my prices.  I say I want to charge cash customers a dollar and I want to charge credit card customers $1.05.  All right? Now, if I put my list price as $1.05 and then the cash customers get a happy surprise, that seems fine.  But if I put my list price as a dollar and then the credit card companies get a not-so-happy surprise, that can't be done.  So it does affect the way a seller communicates which price he's going to say is the regular price, is the list price. So why isn't that a speech regulation? Now, you might say, as the solicitor general does, it is a speech regulation, but it's only a disclosure regulation and subject to a lower standard.  But you're saying it's not a speech regulation at all.  And I want to know why, given that it is affecting which price you choose to say is your list price.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Wu, you think, is this not true, that the dual pricing scheme is legal; is that right?   Elena Kagan  That was something that the Second Circuit did not decide, said it was abstaining on.  It seems to me that that's quite relevant to this question of whether this is a disclosure requirement. Because if the dual pricing scheme is not legal, it is really hard to characterize this as a disclosure requirement. Would you agree with that?   ",15-1391
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Bergeron, could I go back to the question that the Chief Justice asked you. You said that you favored the approach of Fox v. Vice, which is a but-for test.   Elena Kagan  It's would you have incurred this cost anyway even --   Elena Kagan  -- without the misconduct. But Fox v. Vice never uses this language of directness, which seems to me actually much more in line with proximate cause inquiries. Now, Fox v. Vice, you know, never addressed proximate cause either way.  It wasn't a proximate cause fact pattern.  This actually seems not really a proximate cause fact pattern either; it just seems as though it's a -- you know, should there be a but-for test. So I guess I'm wondering, where does this language of -- you say ""but for,"" but you also say ""direct."" What do you mean when you use those two terms?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, suppose we say that the Fox v. Vice but-for test is something along the lines of what we should be applying here.  So how does -- in your reply brief, you basically say that a court can ""never."" You don't -- you don't just say in this case it was wrong.  In your reply brief, you say a court can never say, look, the case would have settled right away, and all costs ought to go to the victimized party. Why is that? If it's a but-for test, why couldn't a court on a proper set of facts say, look, if this -- if this abuse hadn't occurred, this case would just never have gone on?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I don't know what -- what -- too speculative.  I mean, the Court says, look, I understand that I have to find this; you know, that it's more likely than not.  That's how we make findings about what costs would have been incurred anyway. Would -- you know, there's never any certainty.  We're always saying more likely than not, would this cost have been incurred? I think none of the costs of this suit would have been incurred if this abuse hadn't taken place.   Elena Kagan  Yes, but if a lack of certainty like that is going to prevent a judge from actually making an award, then people on the other side, people who are victimized, are going to be undercompensated in case after case after case.   Elena Kagan  When the district court gave these two awards, the 2.7 and the 2 million, do you understand that to have been 2.7 if I'm not bound by a cause requirement; 2 million if I am?   Elena Kagan  So then why hasn't that been done already in the district court? In other words, if you're right, that there is a causation requirement here, we send it back to the district court, hasn't the district court already performed that calculation?   Elena Kagan  What's the difference between the 2 million and the 2.7? What is the $700,000 in there; costs for what?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What costs do you concede you're responsible for?   Elena Kagan  So how much is that?   Elena Kagan  But that's not anything like the full 2 million?   Elena Kagan  You said you wanted to use the Fox v. Vice standard, and part of that is the but-for causation inquiry.  And part of that is a pretty clear statement that we don't expect district court judges to be, you know, green eye-shade accountants, is I think what we called them.   Elena Kagan  To go over each, you know, hour of an attorney's work.  We understand the district courts are going to have to make some broad categories and some guesstimates.  Do you agree with that too?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is it odd that the --   Elena Kagan  But -- but, Mr. Bergeron, you're saying well, you should use a causation test, but you can't ever consider the likelihood of settlement. But the likelihood of settlement might be -- might not be here, but might be in another case, quite relevant to the question of what fees have been caused by the misconduct.   ",15-1406
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, why did she say --   Elena Kagan  Why -- why did the district court set two standards, the 2.7 and the 2.0, if she thought that she was bound by causation? I thought that the -- that the whole idea of those two was, one was, if I'm bound by a causation requirement and one was if I'm not.   Elena Kagan  You said you were going to respond to Justice Alito's statements from the Ninth Circuit.  I have another one to give you. I mean, this is the closest, it seems to me, as to a standard that comes from the Ninth Circuit, that the district court awarded the amount that the Court reasonably believed it cost the Haegers to litigate against a party during the time when that party was acting in bad faith.  So it seems to me that the Ninth Circuit was viewing this chronologically.  When the party was acting in bad faith, all of those costs are -- and fees are appropriate.   ",15-1406
1,"Elena Kagan  Just to make sure I understand, Mr. Kim.  The tip was a neighbor saying that home is supposed to be vacant and yet there's a party going on.  It's not just a neighbor calling and saying there's a very loud party, it's disturbing my sleep.  That the tippee, tipper -- that the tipper specifically said it's supposed to be vacant; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  Multiple?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kim, could you tell me a little bit about how you think the summary judgment posture of this case does or doesn't matter? I mean, usually in summary judgment cases, we say we need to view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. And many of these facts, you could see it one way or you could see it another way.  It has one explanation or it has another explanation. So how does the summary judgment standard fit with the probable cause standard and also with the qualified immunity standard? How do those three things work together here?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Parker --   Robert A. Parker  Yes.   Elena Kagan  -- you know, you're exactly right, that, of course, we have to view this through the eyes of the officer.  And there is much that an officer could look at here and say, I think I have probable cause. And, certainly, when the qualified immunity standard is laid on top of that, makes it even easier for the officer. I guess one of the things that -- that strikes me as why there's resistance here, is that when looked at from the point of view of the reasonable partygoer, it looks a little bit different.  And I -- I take the point that that's not the standard, but we are setting rules and those rules are going to affect how police officers act in the future as well. And when looked at from the reasonable partygoer's view, there are these parties that, once long ago, I used to be invited to -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  -- where you didn't -- don't know the host, but you know Joe is having a party.  And can I say that long, long ago, marijuana was maybe present at those parties? And, you know, so -- and, you know, it just is not obvious that the reasonable partygoer is supposed to walk into this apartment and say: Got to get out of here. And -- and it seems a little bit hard that they're subject to arrest.  So -- so how do I think about that question?   Robert A. Parker  Well, I -- I think there are a couple of ways. I think the overarching point here is that, as I said, when a partygoer goes to a house, if it turns out that it actually is vacant and that they actually are intruding, the police, upon encountering that situation --   Elena Kagan  Right, but they don't know that, as I said.   Robert A. Parker  That's right.   Elena Kagan  I mean, from the partygoers' point of view, they just know that Joe is having a big party, and it's a good time, and -- and maybe there will be some liquor and maybe there will be some recreational drugs.  And -- and they're having a good time.   Robert A. Parker  I -- I think that that's an entirely possible inference to draw, but it's not the only inference.  And I think here there are a number of facts that suggest that that, in fact, was not what was happening. It's not just that the house looked vacant and that people who were reasonably on the scene would -- would be able to observe that this looks like a situation where we should not be; it's that when they were asked about it, the individuals said nothing to dispel probable cause.  If anything, they reinforced it. It wasn't just that none of them lived there; none of them knew who lived there.  They also -- when asked who invited you, almost all of them said somebody else.  The record doesn't reflect whether they named any particular person, but we do know that only two of the individuals on the scene, it appears at least, named Peaches.  And those were two of the young women who had been hired to come dance at this party.  They were not the actual partygoers themselves. When Peaches was -- was called, she, as -- as Mr. Kim explained earlier, was evasive.  She lied to the officers.  She said that she had authority to throw a party there, and she didn't.  All of those things, I think, would fit into a reasonable officer's understanding of the facts and suggest that they may be hearing a story that is not true, both from the partygoers and from Peaches. And certainly I think that when police arrive at a scene and see the actus reus of a crime in the process of being committed, they can at least reasonably intuit that the people here probably know what they're doing. That isn't always going to be able to get you over the probable cause hump, because, as I've said, this is not an area susceptible to those sorts of bright-line rules, but at least it's going to inform what a prudent officer, who is exercising an appropriate level of skepticism when dealing -- may I complete?   ",15-1485
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Garrett, as you say, it is an objective standard.  And there are all these cases in the District of Columbia; Tillman is the one that gets the most emphasis in the briefs, but there are others, right? There's this Artisst, Smith, McGloin, Bowman.  And all of these cases, which are D.C. court cases, say if they upheld convictions, they upheld convictions for trespass, even though the person gave some excuse about how they didn't know or they didn't -- or they -- and they -- and they shouldn't -- they had no reason to know that they were there. And I'm -- I'm just wondering, you're a D.C. police officer and there are all these cases that say, you know, we're going to uphold convictions even though people like the partygoers here have -- get up on the stand and say: This is why I thought I had a right to be here. And, you know, what is a police officer supposed to make of all that law?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Are all the others unlawful entry statutes?   ",15-1485
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, may I ask, Mr. Kneedler, because this aspect of your brief was confusing to me because sometimes you're talking about temporal, and sometimes you're talking about functional. And I want to know what you think the real limitation is.  So take the example that you use, which is the possession of a shotgun example; right?   Elena Kagan  And you say that that would fall outside of Section 16.   Elena Kagan  And the question is why? Temporally, you know, you're possessing a shotgun when you shoot somebody.  You can't do it any other way.  So the temporal analysis doesn't work.  So what is it about that example that makes it fall outside of Section 16, whereas you argued it would have fallen inside of ACCA?   Elena Kagan  Yes, exactly.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So why are you so sure that there would not be the confusion under Section 16?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's absolutely true.  And that's what gave us trouble in ACCA because it could culminate in its use, but it didn't have to culminate in its use. But then you take a case like burglary, and you could say the exact same thing about burglary. Somebody could walk in on a burglary and all of a sudden there would be a use of force.  But a burglary could happen in such a way that nobody walked in and there wouldn't be a use of force. So, again, it just seems as though we're replicating the same kind of confusions, and there's nothing that separates the two.   Elena Kagan  Or at least I'm trying to find out --   Elena Kagan  -- what you think separates the two.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You know --   Elena Kagan  -- I -- I was very struck by that language, too.  And I think it's that language, more than some of the other language you pointed to in its brief, that might suggest that there's some distinction between 16(b) and -- and the ACCA residual clause. But on the other hand, ""by its nature"" seems to suggest an elements focus, a real elements focus. Look at the elements and ask, given those elements, given the nature of the offense, what's going to happen? But, you know, the elements section of Section 16 is Section 16(a)  So it can't be all about all elements. So what is that ""by its nature"" doing?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But why isn't also possession of a shotgun a classic example of that?   Elena Kagan  And -- and give me a contrast.  And by contrast, what that fell under the ACCA residual clause would not fall under 16(b) because the same thing could not be said.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No.  Give me one that would fall under the ACCA residual clause, but -- but -- or where there was confusion as to whether it fell under the residual clause.   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Kneedler, it's absolutely right that the court in Johnson said that those examples compounded the problem.  But the essential problem that the court thought existed was the use of the ordinary case analysis.  So I'm just going to ask you the question that the court asked in Johnson, and I'd -- I -- how do we answer this question? This is what the court said in Johnson: ""How does one go about deciding what kind of conduct the ordinary case of a crime involves? A statistical analysis of the State reporter? A survey? Expert evidence? Google? Gut instinct? So that's a multiple-choice test.  What do we do?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because that is still the same under this statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So can I give you another example just to test how this test works? You say you look to the elements of the -- the offense to see if they give rise to a risk of injury.  Do I have that right?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  How do we do vehicular flight under that example? I'm just trying to sort of ground this.  And you might be right.  I'm not -- you know, I'm just trying to figure out what the difference is if we look at it that way, because that doesn't sound so different from what we were trying to do in ACCA.  In fact, it sounds kind of the same as, honestly. So give me vehicular flight.  How does it work?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So that would fall on -- on the included side? Because I -- I had thought that your brief said something different, but maybe I misread it.   Elena Kagan  And go back to possession of a shotgun, because I'm running over in my mind my memory of the Johnson oral argument where basically the SG's office made exactly this argument about possession of a shotgun, how the elements of that offense are understood to give rise to a significant level of risk.   Elena Kagan  Presumably, the person is possessing the shotgun when the person kills somebody, so it's -- temporally, I don't think that that argument works.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could -- could I ask, just in thinking through your argument, it would help me to get a few examples. So could you give me three examples, let's say, if there are in -- if there are those -- that many, where we struggled under ACCA, but where the answer is clear under 16(b), so that I understand what it -- what kind of distinction you're drawing.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Anything else? Because this is really important for me.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm trying to figure out what our differences are.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean -- I mean, what the Court said is -- I'm quoting -- ""two features of the residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague."" And then there's, you know, a clear holding sentence just a little bit later on in the opinion where it basically tells you exactly what two aspects it's talking about.  It says, ""by combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony.  The residual clause produces more unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause authorized tolerates."" So, you know, it says, Number 1, ordinary case analysis.  Number 2, combined with a fairly fuzzy standard as to the threshold level of risk.  And those were the two factors. And I guess the question is, are those two factors any different here?   Elena Kagan  Here it's the fact that there's ordinary case analysis, both statutes, right?   Elena Kagan  But it is a different kind of categorical approach, isn't it? It's asking what the elements of the offense are that everybody has to commit, as opposed to what the elements of the offense are that people commit in the ordinary case, whatever that might be. And that raises the question that Justice Scalia thought was so important in Johnson and elsewhere, where he says that there's no way really for a Court to do that, you know, this is the -- the line, should we look to a statistical analysis of the state report or a survey, expert evidence, Google, gut instinct, that this is the problem with ACCA's residual clause under Johnson as it is here, is that we don't really have a source of law to look to to tell what an ordinary case is in -- under either statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Before you get into that question, before you get into does it do this in terms of force, or does it do that in terms of injury, before you do any of that, you have to have an understanding of what the ordinary case is. And the problem in Johnson with ACCA's residual clause, according to Justice Scalia and the Court, was that there was no way to tell what that ordinary case was.   Elena Kagan  And, Mr. Rosenkranz, just to tie in this ordinary case problem with this phrase about ""during the commission of the crime,"" has the Government in all of this briefing and in all of this argument ever come up with a single crime in which the ordinary case of that crime, the injury would be occurring after the commission of the crime? If the commission of the crime is taken to mean not just elements but a more general view of what the crime is.     In this case, no.   Elena Kagan  I'm just suggesting that the Government has never come up with a single case under ACCA in which -- and, remember, ACCA requires you to look at the ordinary case. In the ordinary case, what crime has injury that occurs after the commission of the crime? The Government has not told us of any.     If you are -- that is correct, after the crime is over.  I mean --   Elena Kagan  And that's inconsistent with everything that the government has said in multiple cases; isn't that correct?     Yes, in -- in -- I mean, the courts of appeals that have said that those crimes are within the residual --   Elena Kagan  That that's in.     Right.  And so if, that's in, then this whole notion of in the course of committing the crime doesn't do any work.   Elena Kagan  Similarly, the government -- please.   Elena Kagan  And -- and in a crime of moral turpitude, we don't have to consider what the ordinary case is, do we?     I think that is what the Court -- no, not the ordinary case, that is for sure.   Elena Kagan  We don't.     Yes.  That is correct.   Elena Kagan  All we do is look to the elements that everybody has to meet.     Correct, correct.  So let me close with this.  I -- I appreciate the instinct to try and see if this Court can do better with Section 16(b) than it did with ACCA's residual clause, but in deciding whether to take that route, this Court has to decide whether anything is to be gained by this whole enterprise of sending the lower courts back to apply now a different standard and figure out how it applies to all of these crimes, that process is going to be no less arbitrary, no less speculative, and lifetime banishment should not hang on the unpredictable answer to the question, Is this crime in or is it out? Congress can, of course, decide the circumstances under which lifetime residents can be kicked out of this country, but it disserves the separation of powers, that Justice Gorsuch referred to, to allow Congress to pass the buck to immigration officials and courts with a provision this vague. If there are no further questions, we respectfully request that the Court affirm the Court of Appeals. Thank you, Your Honor.   ",15-1498
1,"Elena Kagan  There was something that -- that isn't here, Mr. Rosenkranz, and that is a long history of struggling and failing to come up with an interpretation.  And I'm wondering why you think we don't have that same history.  Because I don't think that there's any question that we would not have said what we said in Johnson had Johnson been the first case. Johnson was the umpteenth case, and we had gone back and forth and we had struggled and we couldn't figure out, and -- and here we don't seem to have any of that.  It seems as though -- and not only with respect to this Court, but with respect to lower courts -- it seems that everybody is getting along just fine.  And much as I can't quite understand what the difference is, there just does seem to be a difference in practice.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Rosenkranz, I guess I would have thought that your answer would have been different.  I guess I would have thought that your answer would have been whatever implications Johnson had for Vagueness Doctrine, it has already had, and that all you are asking us to do is just essentially to say that this statute is no different from the statute that we looked at in Johnson and to write an opinion that basically just repeats Johnson.  And whatever implications it's had or it will have, it will have regardless, and this opinion would do nothing more.   Elena Kagan  He says burglary is that.   Elena Kagan  If I understood what he was saying, and I won't try to put words in his mouth, but it was something along the lines that, yes, it's true that the elements of burglary do not have the use of force.  But if we look back to the historic understanding of burglary, what we find is a longstanding concern with exactly that subject.  In other words, that burglary wouldn't have been defined as it was, wouldn't have been prosecuted as it was, except for this fear of the use of force.  I don't know.  And that's the best I can do with it and he will tell me if he can do better.   ",15-1498
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, why shouldn't we? I mean, you suggest the difference is because this is a voluntary agreement.  But why shouldn't it be the rule that if the State pays, we should understand it to be a suit against the State.   Elena Kagan  I -- I think you're right, Mr. Miller.  I think we would have to change our law to say something like that.  I'm just asking, like what -- why wouldn't that be a sensible rule?   Elena Kagan  So those kinds of considerations haven't prevented us from looking to who's ultimately going to pay the bills in the kinds of cases that Justice Alito was talking about.   Elena Kagan  Is it always the case that the plaintiff simply gets to choose whether it wants to proceed in an individual capacity or in an official capacity, or are there constraints at all on that choice?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, right.  But -- but --   Elena Kagan  Do you think that might have happened here in the court below, in the Connecticut courts, that those two concepts were confused?   Ann O'Connell Adams  The Connecticut supreme court, we think, when you read the opinion, they've definitely decided this case as a matter of tribal sovereign immunity.  I think the -- the mistake that litigants in courts often make is to say that if a tort was committed in the employee's official capacity, it's an official-capacity suit and it's barred by sovereign immunity.  But the Court has repeatedly explained that's not the right way to go about it.  If you're suing the employee in his personal capacity for damages against him, the immunity of his sovereign employer is not implicated. It's possible that this issue could still be decided on remand.  That would be an issue of Connecticut State law to determine whether an official immunity defense has already been raised by citing cases that conflate the concepts, or maybe there's still an opportunity for the Respondent to raise that as a matter of State law.   Elena Kagan  Do you think, Mr. Miller, that there's any decision that precludes us from saying that we're going to treat this as sovereign immunity or not sovereign immunity depending on an -- an indemnification agreement?

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Cross --   Elena Kagan  -- if you take two different kinds of opinions.  One says the test is an arm's length transaction.  Here are the following considerations that we think should be applied in determining whether something is an arm's length transaction. And the second opinion says the test is arm's length transaction, doesn't talk about considerations or factors, just assumes that everybody knows what that arm's length is, and just says here are the facts in this case and then reaches a conclusion, well, this either is or isn't an arm's length transaction. Now, it seems to me that on the first case you would have a good reason for saying: Well, when the court tries to elaborate a test and considers factors and considerations, those things are more a part of the legal inquiry. But when the court just says here is our test, now here is the facts, and then reaches a conclusion, it seems like all of those facts, they're just facts.   Elena Kagan  Well, sometimes there are tests that we think are better formulated at a certain level of generality.  And then we want to, you know, do case-by-case-by-case analysis to figure out what exactly that test means and how it applies in particular circumstances. We don't think the right thing is to set out, you know, a more specific legal test. We think that it will be filled in by factual development.  And that seems what this is, isn't it?   ",15-1509
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, it's not really the legal test according to the Ninth Circuit, right? Because the -- the Ninth Circuit has the arm's length component of its legal test, but it also has this question whether the closeness of the relationship with the debtor is comparable to that of the enumerated insider classifications in the statute. And -- and how any particular set of facts does or does not meet that prong of the test does not seem much of a factual question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, assume a particular set of facts that everybody agrees to.  And then the question is: Well, is that sufficiently close that it's comparable to the enumerated insider classifications? That doesn't seem like any factual question I've ever heard of.   Elena Kagan  But --   Elena Kagan  But one way of thinking of this is that once you have the facts and the facts are uncontested and you're trying to figure out whether those facts satisfy a given legal standard, here whether they are comparably close to the statutory insiders, that then -- what the court is then doing is trying to figure out how important each fact is, given the legal test. And that sounds like a legal inquiry to me or a -- or, you know, how important is this fact in terms of what we should be looking to, in terms of what the legal test is.   Elena Kagan  But that seems easier to say about the arm's length part of the test than about the sufficiently close to a statutory insider part.   Elena Kagan  So Ms. -- Ms. Goodspeed, in your brief, you put a lot of emphasis on the idea that the question of arm's length transaction is one of intent.  And you just said again there what were the parties' motives. But suppose that was not true. Suppose that our understanding of what is or is not an arm's length transaction is more objective in character.  Would your argument still carry the day?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Does -- does the government have a view as to what the correct legal test is?   ",15-1509
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Groen, may I ask --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Groen --   Elena Kagan  -- can I ask just a clarifying question about your argument? One of the things that makes this case odd is that there are family members all around.  Both sellers are the same family and the buyers are the -- but if I'm right, your argument would extend in the exact same way to a situation where you have two sellers who are completely independent of each other.  Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith have nothing to do with each other.  Another buyer comes in, also has no relationship with Mr. Jones or Ms. Smith, and that buyer would be able to make the exact same argument that the Murr family is making in this case. Am I right about your argument?   Elena Kagan  You have --   Elena Kagan  -- two preexisting substandard parcels.  Somebody comes in, buys both, but all the parties are independent of each other.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And now the person who has bought these two standard -- substandard lots wants to build on them, and your argument would be the exact same.   Elena Kagan  But that's a very --   Elena Kagan  That's a very different situation.  In Palazzolo, all we said was that if the seller has a takings claim, it's not extinguished just because the property is transferred; that the buyer could have the exact same takings claim.  But the Murr children are not asking for the -- for the -- they do not have the same takings claim as the Murr parents did; isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The parents could develop on Parcel E; the children can't.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The parents -- let me try this again. For the parents, the two properties were two properties.  It's only when the property becomes one property that this takings claim arises.   Elena Kagan  But the --   Elena Kagan  The -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  The -- the -- the regulation here, the only thing that it affected for the Murr parents and for the plumbing company was their ability to sell to a buyer who wanted to combine these two lots. That was the only thing that was affected; isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Groen, one of the --   Elena Kagan  One of the oddities of your position is that you seem to be taking half of State law.  In other words, you're saying well, there are these -- there are these lot lines, and everything has to depend on the lot lines because they've been legally approved.  But there have been other things in this case that have been legally approved too, and one of them is this merger provision.  And you seem to be saying: Well, we look to State law for the lot lines, but then we ignore State law for the question of when lots are merged. And why should we do that? If we're looking to State law, let's look to State law, the whole ball of wax.  In other words, saying: Well, when I buy those two lots, they're really not two lots anymore. According to State law, they are one lot.   Elena Kagan  Well, I -- I think that you're right, Mr. Groen.  It's like the legal recognition of property.  But the legal recognition of property has something to do with lot lines, and it also has something to do with when lots are merged, when two lots are merged into one.  And why would we ignore that question of merger?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And what would it take to be formally merged?   Elena Kagan  Why?   Elena Kagan  Because if the Court --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If the State can say we don't have to eliminate lot lines.  All we have to do is to say the -- the lot lines don't have legal effect for some purposes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, again, I think --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- Palazzolo depends on the buyers having the exact same takings claim as the sellers, which it seems to me does not exist in this case. But let me ask you a different -- a different way around the question, which is, whether you think reasonable expectations matter at all in your framework?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.   Elena Kagan  But here, if I'm buying property in this area, I also know that there are these rules about when you can develop on substandard lots and how it is that contiguous lots are understood for purposes of that development potential.  So why aren't I buying subject to those preexisting regulations? In other words, this is not a regulation that just happened to me when I was an owner.  I'm buying subject to -- and property is a bundle of sticks; we know that, right, first year of law school.  And I'm buying, you know, certain metes and bounds, but I'm also buying into a certain set of things about what I can and can't do on the property.  So why isn't that perfectly consistent with my reasonable expectations? I'm supposed to know the zoning regulations, and when I buy a house, when I buy a piece of land, I'm buying subject to the preexisting zoning regulations.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But --   Elena Kagan  So the usual way --   Elena Kagan  The usual way, Mr. Groen, or at least a frequent way in which this comes up is a developer buys a hundred acres of land, and that land is split up into 100 one-acre parcels.  And let's say 15, one-five, percent of them are on wetlands and can't be built on.  It makes an enormous difference whether we're going to say that those 15 percent are independent lots, because if they are, then the developer comes in and says you have to pay me for all of that.  But if they're not, the developer is out of luck because it's only 15 percent of the whole.  Isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  Well, the subdivision has occurred with government approval, and the merger provision has occurred with government approval, saying that this shouldn't be understood in the case of substandard lots as independent.

1,"Elena Kagan  General --   Elena Kagan  General --   Elena Kagan  May I ask a question.  The difference between you and the other folks on that side of the room is that they want to look at reasonable expectations, and State law, in part, defines those reasonable expectations, but they're allowing for the idea that other things might come in as well, and you're saying it's all and only State law. Now, I'm pretty sympathetic to the idea that preexisting State law really does influence quite a bit your expectations about what property you own and what you can do with it.  But still, what's the harm of doing what the government and the county want rather than what you want in terms of saying the analysis should be a little bit more fluent, fluid, sure, State law matters, but maybe other the things matter too in a particular situation.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Landau, could I ask you to focus on the text here a little bit? Because this gateway theory of yours, I'm not sure it matches up with the text very well.  I mean, you could have a gateway provision which said something like, Puerto Rico is a State for all purposes except Chapter 9, or except for any provision in Chapter 9, or something like that.  But Chapter 9 -- but this provision, 101(52), is written much more specifically.  It says, ""except for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor under Chapter 9.""  So it's not any provision in Chapter 9; it's just for the purpose of defining who may be a debtor.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Landau, I -- I think I get what you're saying now, which I didn't when I started with.  You're saying they couldn't just say it's a State, except for purposes of Chapter 9, because, in fact, there's something that's outside of Chapter 9 that determines who gets into Chapter 9. So what they did was they said it's a State, except for purposes of this gateway, and then they assumed that that meant that all of Chapter 9 wouldn't apply either.  That's your basic argument.   Elena Kagan  So -- but before 1984, before this amendment, this 903(1) did apply to Puerto Rico; wasn't that right?   Elena Kagan  So you're saying that the really super significant change, which is 903(1) applies to Puerto Rico before 1984, and then doesn't apply after 1984 because of this definitional move that they made here in 101(52). What you have to admit is -- I'm not quite sure what the -- the word -- I mean, it's a -- it would be a mysterious way, it would be an extremely kind of cryptic odd way to make such a major change.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, it's almost like somebody doesn't want everybody to recognize what a major change is being made --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- and figured out this way that is -- where nobody would understand that that was happening, including the judges who would have to decide what this meant.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. McGill --   Elena Kagan  Can I talk to you about Mr. Landau's textual argument? Because I came in here thinking that your best argument is straight on the text.  It's not about purpose, because I don't know what Congress's purpose here was; it's not on policy.  It's just straight on the text.  But I now have a better understanding of Mr. Landau's understanding of the text, and so I just want to engage you on that, which is: Look, Congress couldn't have just said ""except for purposes of Chapter 9"" because of this flukey thing, which is that the gateway provision is outside of Chapter 9.  So if it had just said ""except for purposes of Chapter 9,"" somebody could have said, oh, well, look, I am entitled to be a debtor under Chapter 9, whether or not I'm thought of as a State.  And so they did it this other way, which said -- which attacked the gateway provision particularly.  And then in doing that, they assumed that all of Chapter 9 would follow in its wake. Once you're not eligible for Chapter 9, none of the provisions of Chapter 9 apply to you.  That's basically Mr. Landau's provision -- argument.  So tell me why that's wrong.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. -- Mr. McGill, if I could go back to Justice Breyer's question, because Justice Breyer gave you a view of the way to read this text, which is built on Mr. Landau's view, and said, what's wrong with that? And you -- you go with the gateway provision, and then even if not all of Chapter 9 follows in its wake, at least all the provisions in Chapter 9 that refer to debtors follow in its wake. And Justice Breyer said, what's wrong with that, as a way to read this text.  And then you answered him, I think this is fair to say, by giving a -- a story about what Congress meant to do in 903(1) in the wake of Faitoute. But, you know, both of you have stories about this, and it's not -- just not clear which of you is right.  And I guess what I most want to think about is this text.  Why isn't Justice Breyer's, Mr. Landau's view of the text just as good, if not better, than yours? And I didn't come in here thinking that, but now I kind of am thinking that. So talk to me about the text, why that's not just as good a view of the text?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's -- that's a purpose that tells you whether you're now in Chapter 9 as a debtor.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So what Mr. Landau is saying is once you say you're -- you're -- you're not a State, when it comes to who may be a debtor under Chapter 9, that it's a pretty natural thing to say, and that means that any provisions about being a debtor under Chapter 9 don't apply to you.

Now, that's as compared to just in 2012, where fewer than 100,000 lived over 150 miles, and only 10,000 lived more than 200 miles away.  So we're going from, like, 10,000 to three-quarters of a million living more than 200 miles away.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, can the legislature say anything, General? I mean, if the legislature says we have a -- a health-related abortion regulation here, we've looked around the country and we think that there are ten great hospitals in the country, you know, Massachusetts General, Brigham and Women's, and we're going to make all our abortion facilities conform to the standards of those hospitals, and that will -- you know, that will increase medical care.  Now, it's true we don't make anybody else doing any kind -- other kind of procedure conform to those standards, but we think it will increase health benefits if abortion facilities conform to them.  Would that be all right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So every abortion facility has to hit the standards of MGH.  That would be all right?   Elena Kagan  I'm sure that there's medical evidence that if every hospital, if every facility was as good as Massachusetts General, they would be better facilities.  I'm sure that you could find doctors to say that, because MGH, it's a great hospital.  But that would be okay, even though it's not applied to any other kind of facility doing any other kind of procedure, even though we know that liposuction is 30 times more dangerous, yet doesn't have the same kinds of requirements.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  General, could -- could I ask -- could I go back to a question that -- something that you said earlier? And tell me if I'm misquoting you.  You said that as the law is now, under your interpretation of it, Texas is allowed to set much, much higher medical standards, whether it has to do with the personnel or procedures or the facilities themselves, higher medical standards, including much higher medical standards for abortion facilities than for facilities that do any other kind of medical work, even much more risky medical work.  And you said that that was your understanding of the law; am I right?   Elena Kagan  And I guess I just want to know why would Texas do that? (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  No, I know, but -- but the assumption of the question, and I think you haven't challenged this assumption, is that there are many procedures that are much higher risk: Colonoscopies, liposuctions, we could go on and on.  And -- and you're saying, that's okay, we get to set much higher standards for abortion.  And I just want to know why that is.   Elena Kagan  But, of course, the -- I mean, Texas's own regulations actually have made abortion facilities such that that can never happen, because you have continual inspections, I mean, to your credit.  So that was really not a problem in Texas, having a kind of rogue outfit there.  Texas has taken actions to prevent that. So, again, I just sort of -- I'm left wondering, given this baseline of regulation that prevents rogue outfits of -- like that, why it is that Texas would make this choice.  And you say you're allowed to make this choice, and we can argue about that.  I just want to know why Texas would make it.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, the section -- I mean, the question here is -- that seems right.  The question is whether a sovereign is entitled to immunity, and I guess I -- I would ask you to look at the statute, and to try to explain to me your reading of the language in the statute.  So the statute says ""a foreign state shall not be immune... in any case... in which rights in property taken in violation of international law are in issue."" Right? Now, it seems to me that you are reading this statute as if it said that a foreign state shall not be immune in any case in which rights and property have been taken in violation of international law.  In other words, you're taking out the ""are in issue"" language and suggesting that the question at the threshold is -- is -- is whether the rights and property, in fact, have been taken, rather than whether they are in dispute.   Elena Kagan  Well, what -- what is left to be in issue, if you've already decided that there is a right on property and it has -- and that it has been taken in violation of international law?   Elena Kagan  I think I'm just -- I'm just missing what -- and maybe I'm just missing it.  But this -- it seems it's a funny way of writing this if you're right.  If you're right, Congress should just have said, well, a foreign State shall not be immune in any case in which there's a right in property taken -- that has been taken in violation of international law. What is the ""are in issue"" language doing, except to say that the inquiry is whether there is a dispute about whether there's a violation of international law?   Elena Kagan  Your response to Justice Breyer suggests that it's not only a question of legal sufficiency -- and I think that the government specifically says this in its brief --   Elena Kagan  -- that you would also have a factual -- any factual disputes addressed at that time.  So if there are factual disputes, you know, there's -- there's a pleading.  It's -- it is legally sufficient, but a defendant can come in and say, well, it might be legally sufficient, but the facts are just wrong.  And you would have that at the jurisdictional stage too; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So I'm going to ask you -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  And you think it's -- it's taken in violation of international law, and that's also a predicate for what's in issue; is that right?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  I don't think that ""in issue"" actually applies to ""taken in violation of international law."" I think that ""taken in violation of international law"" is describing and defining the kind of property that you have to be talking about in this case.   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess the question is, though, what's left to be in issue? If you're right that the question of whether there is a right in property is decided at the jurisdictional stage, both law and fact, and if you are right that the question of whether that right in property has been taken in violation of international law is also decided, both law and fact, at the jurisdictional stage, then what is the issue, the in issue, that's left for the merits?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  So I disagree with part of what you said.  I do think that the question of whether property was taken in violation of international law is something has to be decided at the jurisdictional stage in law, where there's a challenge like there is here, or in fact, if there's a factual challenge.  But with respect to rights and property, those can be an issue. So I don't think you need to decide at the jurisdictional stage whether or not the plaintiff actually possesses the right that they claim. So, for instance, if you had a plaintiff who came in and said, I have a deed to this property and it was taken away from me, and the foreign State wanted to come back and say, no, you don't, this deed is a forgery, you never had any relationship to this property at all, that would be in issue and that would be something that could be decided at the merits. The rights and property question that has to be decided at the jurisdictional stage is the one that this Court decided in Permanent Mission, which is, is this right that's being asserted here something that falls within the definition of rights and property that the FSIA put forward? And so in Permanent Mission, the question was: Is this asserted-lien right a right in property, even though it's not a right to possession of the property or to ownership of the property --   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm not understanding the distinction.  Could you -- in this case, what would be the first question that would be the threshold question as to a right in property, and what would be the question that would get diverted to the merit stage?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  In this case, I think the question mainly is the question about whether what's being asserted is a right in property.  Here, it's a question of whether a shareholder's rights in the company that they own shares in are something that are rights in the property of that subsidiary company, the company that the shareholder has some corporate ownership interest in.  And that is a legal question that could be answered at the jurisdictional stage.  And here, we don't know the answer to that question, because all the --   Elena Kagan  And what's the question that would be answered at the merit stage?   Elaine J. Goldenberg  The question that would be answered at the merit stage here, I don't think there actually would be much dispute on the merits.  But, for instance, in a case like this, you could have a dispute about whether the plaintiff was actually a shareholder or was not a shareholder.  Or in the example I gave before, which I think would be the more common situation, whether the person actually had a deed to that property, or whether they didn't have a deed.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Carroll, I -- though I have a good deal of sympathy with the way you read the language, but it does seem to me it gets you into one big problem. So, you know, take a case where there is an arguable claim that there's been a violation of international law, so you would satisfy the Bell v. Hood standard, but then the actual claim that's being made is just a straight conversion claim.

Elena Kagan  And may I ask, a lot of your briefing in this case operates on the premise that there really was -- that this claim will spring back, that there was some kind of reservation --   Elena Kagan  -- of rights such that this claim would spring back.  And I'm wondering why you think that.  Where do you get that from? I mean, was this something that the parties, just a general understanding in this case that they were dismissing it, but that it would spring back if they won the appeal?   Elena Kagan  I guess I read your brief, so I have largely bought into that assumption.  And if that were true, it does seem to me like you have an awfully good argument, but it would not be final, then, under 1291.  And I guess I was just asking why it was that your brief essentially, you know, for two-thirds of the brief or more, bought into that assumption, whether there was something that I didn't see or some general understanding that the parties had that -- that suggested that assumption was the right one to make.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, do you think that should be something? The -- the lower courts did not address that question.  And -- and that question seems, at least in part, dependent on fact, that -- that -- that you would think the lower courts might have some better view on than we do. Would that suggest a remand on that question?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There was no discovery here?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So just --   Elena Kagan  -- out of curiosity -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  And what criteria did they use?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But what did they really use? Did they, you know, basically take a peek at the merits? What did they do?   ",15-457X
0,"Elena Kagan  Just before the --   Elena Kagan  So there -- there is this one case that suggested that that is what would happen. I mean, is this a procedure that's used in the Ninth Circuit? What is it used for? Why did people think that this was the governing law?   Elena Kagan  Could --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could I take you back, sorry, just to this sort of nonreservation reservation point.  You said there were two things that you did that fit with the Ninth Circuit's procedure.  You said it wasn't settled, and you said that you were going to appeal; is that right?   Elena Kagan  Right.  So where -- where did those requirements come from? You know, if I looked at what cases would I find that that's what you have to do in order to prejudice -- in order to dismiss something with prejudice in such a way that it springs back to life if you win the appeal?

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal, I wonder whether there's one difference between the postdischarge case and the predischarge case.  You've been talking a lot about contamination and outside influence.  In there it seems as though the inquiry is roughly the same, but there's no way in which the postdischarge case seems different, which is that once you are discharged, you just take off your juror hat psychologically, mentally, and you start thinking about a case in a different way, and you start even wondering whether, when you had your juror hat on, you were thinking about it in the right way.  And I wonder whether that is a difference that makes a difference in this context.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess in answer to my question, I was not looking so much for a historical answer.  You both have your historical arguments.  But for an answer about why we should take this very seriously and think that it makes the postdischarge context different from the precharge -- predischarge context where the -- the inquiry that we do in the predischarge context about have you talked to anybody, have you read a newspaper, just really doesn't get to the heart of the matter in the postdischarge context, which is that you've just taken off your juror clothes and maybe started thinking about what you did when they were on in an entirely different way.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco, could I ask -- the line you're drawing between exercising influence and providing access, just to sort of test that with a hypothetical, suppose that somebody knew that there was a -- a contractor who was going to award a very large contract to one of two or three firms that the -- that he was meeting with.  And -- and a company paid to make sure that they were on the meet list, to be one of those two or three firms, in other words, bribed --   Elena Kagan  -- an official in order to become one of those two or three firms from which that was the pool from which --   Elena Kagan  -- this billion-dollar contract would emerge, would that be sufficient?   Elena Kagan  Can I --   Elena Kagan  Well, can I follow up on that? Because what you just suggested, right, is that you could -- suppose that there were a scheduler for a Governor or for the President or whatever, and that scheduler was selling meetings.  So you would think that's part of her job? And if I just understood you correctly, that falls within the statute?   Elena Kagan  Mr. --   Elena Kagan  Can I --   Elena Kagan  Can I ask --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Francisco --   Elena Kagan  -- if -- you said something before, and I might have misunderstood you.  But do you think that -- of the five listed ""official acts,"" do you think none of them meet the standards that you're suggesting, or do you think some of them do and some of them don't?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So let me --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Go ahead, please.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  That -- that might be right.  It might be that -- that you still have a -- a winning argument even if some of the five are fine. But -- but if we could just focus on them for a bit.  I mean, for example, the third one --   Elena Kagan  The 6091.   Elena Kagan  Contacting other officials to influence Virginia State researchers to initiate clinical studies.  So that's the one that seems to me to really fall within your own definition.  Do you disagree with that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So on something like that, your argument is a sufficiency argument?   Elena Kagan  Rather than this was -- this is not an ""official act""?   Elena Kagan  If it's true, but --   Elena Kagan  Well, what would -- Mr. Francisco, just take Mr. Dreeben's own example, which is the example of somebody -- he's running a business, and he's taking $5,000 at a pop every time he arranges a meeting with the criminal division for somebody.

1,"Elena Kagan  You're saying that the signature would not be enough because that could be pro forma? Is that what you're saying?   Elena Kagan  So I'm -- I guess I'm --   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm a little bit unclear as to what you're arguing.  I mean, one rule could be did the judge have some significant involvement in a critical trial decision as a lawyer.  Is that your rule, or are you adding something to that rule?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  There's something --   Elena Kagan  Well, do they have to hear --   Elena Kagan  Excuse me.   Elena Kagan  There's something unsatisfying about the remedy that you're requesting, right? Because if the idea is that one judge can affect a whole panel, which seems right to me, but presumably that effect doesn't go away the moment that we send it back and they have to deal with it again, so aren't -- don't they continue to be tainted in some way?   Elena Kagan  What is the standard on rehearing? Is -- is -- it must be a very different standard, isn't it?   ",15-5040
0,"Elena Kagan  It's --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Eisenberg --   Elena Kagan  If I understood your answer to the Chief Justice, you said significant involvement in a critical trial decision would be a critical factor in deciding when a person had crossed the constitutional line.  You then simply said that there's kind of a statute of limitations on it, and because this is 30 years ago, that makes a difference. Am I understanding you correctly?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm not sure I understood the difference there.  You mean you have to be in trial in the courtroom as opposed to in the office making critical strategy decisions about how to prosecute a case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, just -- I mean, just go back to what the test is.  So it's significant involvement in what, at what time?   Elena Kagan  And what time is the critical time?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is it six months? Five years? Ten years?   Elena Kagan  But as I understand you, the one factor that seems to be controlling here is the time limit.  And other than that, there's -- everything points to due process demanding a recusal, except for the time limit.   Elena Kagan  He made the most important decision that could be made in this case.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  Isn't there a difference between those two things?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you think he didn't take that decision extremely seriously?

0,"Elena Kagan  I -- please.  Sorry.   Elena Kagan  No, please.   Elena Kagan  You mentioned Hallstrom a couple of times --   Elena Kagan  -- and rely on it heavily in the briefs.  But Hallstrom has very different statutory language.  Hallstrom says no action may be commenced unless a condition is met. And, similarly, in 3730, the statute uses language that makes it clear that dismissal is appropriate when a mandatory requirement is not met.  It says, ""the Court shall dismiss an action or claim."" It says, ""in no event may a person bring an action."" It says the court -- ""no court shall have jurisdiction."" All of that way of -- all of those phrasings indicate what happens when a requirement isn't satisfied. But there is no such language with respect to this requirement.  I mean, it's a mandatory requirement, but it doesn't say what happens if the requirement isn't satisfied.  And that makes it very different from Hallstrom and from the other language in Section 3730.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You said your test would put -- would make bad faith primary.  What exactly does that mean? I mean, take a case where there was bad faith, but in fact there was also a pretty minor breach that was not likely to cause any harm, and in fact did not cause any harm, and the government comes in to the district court and says, it's not in our interests for this case to be dismissed.  Why should the Court nonetheless dismiss the case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, then, what does it mean for bad -- why do you say -- is it -- how is it first among equals? Why isn't it just something that a district court should take into account as this district court took it into account?   Elena Kagan  Well, but it did both.  When -- when one factor is the seriousness of the violation, presumably one measures the seriousness of the violation by asking whether the violation is likely to cause harm ex-ante. So it's really looking to both.  It's calling them different things, but it's saying, we're going to check out the seriousness of the violation, whether it's likely to produce harm, what the risk of harm is, and we're going to ask in ways we ask in the law all the time, did it in fact cause that harm?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If there is a primary factor, why shouldn't the primary factor just be what the government wants? In other words, why shouldn't this be -- given that the government is the beneficiary of this provision, why shouldn't we give very significant discretion to the government?   Elena Kagan  Do you think deference ought to be given to the government? And if so, as to what parts of the test?   John F. Bash  Well, what we say in the brief is deference ought to be given to the government's statement that it's been harmed.  So we use the phrase ""substantial weight,"" and we're not weighted to that phraseology.  But if the government comes in and says yes or no on harm, we think that should be given deferential --   Elena Kagan  On actual harm?   John F. Bash  Yeah.  Well, we didn't come in here and say either that or whether the suit should be dismissed.  We just didn't say anything.  And we think, as I said, that the Court would have been within its discretion to dismiss this case.  We just think this Court ought to say, this is a classic area for discretion. Mr. Chief Justice, Ms. Sullivan said she raised the question of the application -- her client raised the question of misapplication all the way through.  We sure don't read the petition to raise that question.  It wouldn't be out of the ordinary for the Court to go on and say, this is how the abuse of discretion standard ought to be applied. But they cited pages 17 through 19 and 26 through 28 of the petition.  We don't read those to preserve an application argument.  Those are making arguments like the multifactor standard is difficult to apply.  I think there is one sentence on page 28 that maybe you could read that way.  We don't read that to have fairly preserved the application argument. And then just to -- and the waiver question. There is a whole other set of arguments they've made in their briefs that haven't come up in argument today about other violations that they think occurred that the lower courts held not to be violations.  That is extremely far outside the scope of the question presented, and they haven't raised it at oral argument. But I just -- that point is clearly waived, I think.   Elena Kagan  And do you think it might be helpful for this Court to clarify that when we're talking about the severity of the violation, part of what we are talking about is the likelihood that the violation might cause harm?   John F. Bash  I think it would be helpful for the opinion to say that.  I don't think the courts below were under a misapprehension about that.  I mean, they talked about the most severe violation being, like I say, just a blatant -- oh, I'm sorry.  I see my red light is on.   ",15-513X

0,"Elena Kagan  But it is current.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It is current at all the time in which he resides there.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, then, you're just reading pursuant to subsection (a) out of the statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Excuse me, Mr. Gannon. It tells you exactly what it means to be a jurisdiction involved.  It means a jurisdiction involved pursuant to a particular subsection which focuses only on his current residence.  And all the time he was a current resident of Kansas, the registry was accurate.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Gannon --   Elena Kagan  It seems to me that what you're saying is that each of those offenders is supposed to recognize the underlying purpose of the law, which is to have accurate registries, and to do everything he can to serve that underlying purpose.  And we would -- you know, it would be good if everybody did that.  But the text of the law is something different. And if you look at this text of the law, there's just no way that a reasonable reader reads that text and says it requires me to provide departure notification when I leave to another country.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you can say well, he's supposed to keep it current, and -- and that's right. He is -- he should keep it current, because we would all like sex registry.  But the statute provides very specific details about what it means to keep it current, and it seems to me he has conformed with every single one of those requirements.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You know, he could have, and he should have.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But he didn't have to under --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- this statutory language.   Elena Kagan  It -- it says he has to have informed at least one jurisdiction involved pursuant to subsection (a), and subsection (a) makes clear that the only jurisdictions that they're talking about are the jurisdictions in which he currently either lives, works, or is a student.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that morning --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That morning, everything was current.  And then when he left Kansas, he's not subject to this statutory provision anymore.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That is 16921(b)? Is that the one you're referring to there?   Elena Kagan  But 16921(b)(3) is specifically an obligation that's placed on officials. It has nothing to do with any obligations on offenders.   Elena Kagan  So but an offender is supposed to look at a statute that places only an obligation on State officials and to say, really? That obligation applies to me as well?   Elena Kagan  Could I -- could I ask a question, Mr. Gannon, of absolutely no legal significance? Chalk it up to curiosity. Does the Federal government bring many of these prosecutions? Because I might have thought that when sex offenders leave the country permanently, the attitude might be like, good luck and good riddance? (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you're not -- you're -- as I understand the requirement that even you say he's subject to, it's just a requirement that says he's leaving the State.  It doesn't -- he's not required to tell you where he's going in the world.  He could be going to the Philippines or any other country.  So it doesn't really help us in terms of, you know, helping our allies deal with sex offenders. I'm just curious why it is that people -- why DOJ makes the decision to bring sex offenders back to this country in such circumstances.   Elena Kagan  I am right, right, that when you say he had the responsibility to keep the registry accurate, that's just to say he had the responsibility to tell Kansas he was no longer in Kansas.   Elena Kagan  Even on your view, he had no other responsibilities.   Elena Kagan  Right.  And I completely understand that, Mr. Gannon, but even your own interpretation doesn't get you the information -- (Laughter.) (Lights out.)   Elena Kagan  My red light on the bench is still working. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  -- does not get you the information that you need in order to tell the Philippines, look, you have a sex offender in your midst.   ",15-5238
0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Blatt, it does seem to me that's what your argument rests on in the end: The idea that we shouldn't give any weight or any influence to an invalid conviction.  Is that a double jeopardy principle, or does it come from someplace else?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  Well, why do we do that? I mean, I take it you have -- you know, usually you do pretend that they don't exist.  There are not many instances that we can find where we do look to vacated convictions for something or other.  But in this case, the vacated conviction surely does tell us something about what the jury did do or what the jury didn't do.  It's part of the factual picture, and so the question has to be, well, notwithstanding that, why shouldn't we look at it? And I guess the -- why?   Elena Kagan  You know, I think you're contesting the premise of my question.  Because the premise of my question is that this vacated conviction does tell you something about what the jury did.  Now what it tells you is that the jury did inconsistent things, because the vacated conviction tells you that, on the one hand, the valid convictions, the jury said that there was not bribery.  And on the other hand, the vacated conviction, the jury said there was bribery. And let's assume for the moment that that's true, that that is exactly what the vacated convictions tell you.  They tell you that the jury went in two inconsistent ways.   Elena Kagan  And now you're saying, notwithstanding that the vacated conviction tells you something about what the jury did or didn't do about how the jury reasoned, we shouldn't look at it. And there's something very powerful, rhetorically, in your statement.  But I guess what I'm trying to figure out: Is it anything more than rhetoric? Is --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- there, like, a legal principle here about why we shouldn't look to vacated convictions to tell us something about the facts, when they can tell us something about the facts?   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  I --   Elena Kagan  Maybe one way I can figure out the scope of your argument is just to ask, do you think that the government is always unable to use a vacated conviction, that is for any purpose, or do you think that the government is unable to use a vacated conviction only for double jeopardy purposes?   Elena Kagan  So you have the history on your side, most of it.  Do you think that that's because the government, you know, cannot use a vacated conviction for any purpose?   Elena Kagan  This isn't a double jeopardy argument.  This is a something else argument.   Elena Kagan  But what is it? What is the something else? Why can't the government use a vacated conviction for any purpose?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Look at the label.  It's void ab initio, but I mean, it's void in the sense that you can't be punished for a vacated conviction.  But the question is, can we use what the vacated conviction tells us about a historical fact, or can we use it for some other purpose that, you know, that I'm not thinking about right now?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But -- but, you know, what's -- what part of the Constitution are we looking to to tell us this?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's not the question I'm asking.   ",15-537X
1,"Elena Kagan  What other purpose could you use a vacated conviction for? Is there anything else that the government can use a vacated conviction for, or is this the only thing?   Elena Kagan  Who -- who's not --   Elena Kagan  Ms. Blatt suggested that there's something -- I think she used the word ""unseemly"" -- about using a vacated conviction for this, or indeed for any other purpose, given the traditions of our legal system where it's just very hard to find instances in which we have done so. So, you know, I'm not sure I understand where the unseemliness prohibition comes from, but it does seem, you now, quite out of kilter with the traditions of our legal system to use vacated convictions in a manner that affects individuals' constitutional rights.  So, I guess, tell me why we shouldn't be concerned about that?   Elena Kagan  I think the tradition goes further.  I mean, you have a tough time in your brief coming up with any instances, and the only times you do are -- are some -- a couple of scattered lower court decisions.  But you have, other than that, a really tough time coming up with any instances in which courts have used vacated convictions for any purpose.   Elena Kagan  But that is the greater remedy that Yeager gave, and I understand your distinction between Yeager and this case, but it does leave you with a fundamental anomaly, which is, in a case in which there's an acquittal and a hung count, the acquittal is the only thing that matters.  And in a case where there's an acquittal and a vacated conviction, you know, where a court has said this has got to be -- this has got to be reversed and it no longer exists, in that case the person comes up with a far less good situation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It makes sense in terms of parts of Yeager's reasoning, but not in terms of other parts of Yeager's reasoning. Another part of Yeager's reasoning just said hung counts have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.  And similarly, one could say vacated convictions have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.  They are vacated.  They are nullities.  You don't get respect for that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I see -- when I read Yeager, I see two different rationales, and on one you're exactly right.  There's a real distinction with this case. On the other, seems you're exactly wrong. There's no distinction in this case at all because both have never been accorded respect as a matter of law or history.   ",15-537X
1,"Elena Kagan  But --   Elena Kagan  So do you think, Mr. Cortman, suppose there was an application and a -- from a -- a church that used its playground for religious activities.  Had prayer services there, for example.  Could the State, in your view, deny the money on that ground, or at least would you think that that was a significantly different case?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That they -- I'm sorry. They don't think they should --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How would you -- for example, one of the things that the Court has -- has thought about in the past is like computers for education.  So I guess somebody could make the same argument about computers.  Well, it doesn't really -- it's separate from the religious instruction that might be carried out over those computers. Do you think that that's the same, or is it different?   Elena Kagan  Would you say --   Elena Kagan  Well, I'm sorry --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Cortman, my questions about religious uses, I think, was to get at a -- a broader point, a broader distinction, and asked -- ask what you think of it.  And as it seems that you are on strongest ground when you say, look, the State has decided to fund some activity, and it's denying that -- that funding to a particular party based solely on that party's religious status.   Elena Kagan  And that's the way you briefed the case. I hear you making a different argument, or a broader argument now, that extends into a State's decision to deny some uses -- to deny funding to some uses at the same time as it gives funding to other uses, and a State's decision to say, look, we really just don't want to fund religious exercise.  They can do religious exercise.  We don't want to fund religious exercise.  And I understand that you might think that's out of bounds, too.  But what I'm trying to figure out is, is there a distinction between these two things.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  So you don't disagree with that.   Elena Kagan  But the State is entitled to say you can't use this money for religious activity, and maybe I'll bring you a little bit further, we're entitled to take certain prophylactic measures to make sure that you don't use the money for religious activity.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, then how about the --   Elena Kagan  May I take you back to the substance, Mr. Cortman, unless anybody -- it's -- let's talk a little bit about federalism, and here's what I would like to know.  You know, usually when we see these funding cases, it comes in a different context.  It comes where the State wants to give money and somebody is objecting.  And this case comes in the converse way, where a State says we just don't want to fund --   Elena Kagan  -- this institution.  And these -- these church/States divide, it's a -- it's a fraught issue.  It's a hard issue.  It's a -- it's an issue in which States have their own very longstanding law.  It's an issue on which I -- I guess I'm going to say nobody is completely sure that they have it right. And -- and so I guess there's something attractive about having some play in the joints where States can go their own way and make their own choices.  And why shouldn't this be one of those cases?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that's, of course, true, that if there's a -- a constitutional right at stake, that trumps.  But the question is, how are we going to interpret the constitutional right? What are we -- so -- so I guess what I'm asking is, do you see value in the other side in having some flexibility here for States to make these sorts of choices?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But one last -- I know your white light is on.  But might the State think that here's the problem.  The problem is this church has come in with a very competitive application.  We want to give money to this church.  Let's say, you know, a Protestant church.  There's a Catholic church across the street. Catholic church applies, doesn't get money, this happens five years running.  And people start thinking, well, why is the Protestant church keeping on getting the money and the Catholic church never gets the money? And the State says, we just won't -- don't want to sow that kind of division, that kind of mistrust, that kind of -- well, that --   ",15-577X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Layton --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Layton, could we go back to where Justice Alito started --   Elena Kagan  -- and -- and you said no money to churches.  Why can the State provide police protection or fire protection?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Layton, I understand that --   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Layton, let's say I -- I accept that the State might have an interest in saying we just don't want to be seen as giving money to one church and not another in these selective programs.   Elena Kagan  I -- I think that that's legitimate. But here's the thing.  There's a constitutional principle.  It's as strong as any constitutional principle that there is, that when we have a program of funding -- and here we're funding playground surfaces -- that everybody is entitled to that funding, to -- to that particular funding, whether or not they exercise a constitutional right; in other words, here, whether or not they are a religious institution doing religious things.  As long as you're using the money for playground services, you're not disentitled from that program because you're a religious institution doing religious things. And I would have thought that that's a pretty strong principle in our constitutional law.  And how is that the State says that that's not violated here?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think --   Elena Kagan  But here's the deal.  You're right that this is a selective program.  It's not a general program in which everybody gets money.  But still the question is whether some people can be disentitled from applying to that program and from receiving that money if they are qualified based on other completely nonreligious attributes, and they're disqualified solely because they are a religious institution doing religious things.  Even though they're not -- they could -- they could promise you, we're not going to do religious things on this playground surface, and you're still saying, well, no, you -- you can't get the money.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I don't understand -- I -- I think I understand how the States' interests might differ some, but essentially this is a program open to everyone.  Happens to be a competitive program, but everyone is open to compete on various neutral terms, and you're depriving one set of actors from being able to compete in the same way everybody else can compete because of their religious identification.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  And those are interests.  I don't mean to say that those are not valid interests.  But it does seem as though this is a clear burden -- looked at that way, this is a clear burden on a constitutional right.  And then your interests have to rise to an extremely high level.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's a burden on constitutional right, in other words, because people of a certain religious status are being prevented from competing in the same way everybody else is for a neutral benefit.

So, Mr. Yang, I'm putting you on notice that this is a question to you too, because both of you are saying, look, there needs to be an intent to deceive the bank.

And you agree with that.   Elena Kagan  I'm going to think, and Mr. Yang you'll tell me, that Mr. Yang would agree with that too.  So what are we fighting about?   Elena Kagan  Then it's just -- Mr. Yang would say, well, look, a bank has a possessory interest in assets that are part of its depositor's account, and so, you know, that's -- whether you target the depositor's account or you target something else, you're still manifesting the same intent to deprive the bank of a property including possessory interest.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That seems right to me.  I want to point, you know, that you might say all of that is right and that the government and you agree, and what you really disagree on is whether these instructions reflected that correct understanding of the law.  And that seems fair to me.  And we should talk about the instructions.   Elena Kagan  But it seems to me that the understanding of the law is now you are in perfect harmony.   Elena Kagan  I think it --   Elena Kagan  But it --   Elena Kagan  Which you -- which you now include can include possessory interests.   Elena Kagan  No.   Elena Kagan  Most of them don't care.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Bell, I think your answer is, no, Your Honor, because the instructions don't reflect your understanding of the law.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm not saying it does.  I think it's a hard question as to whether the instructions do or don't, but it does seem to me you have an argument about the instructions.   INTERRUPTING ",15-5991
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, not just the heading, but analysis in that part C as well.  I mean, the part C just seems to contradict part A or B or whichever it was.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If you really mean an intent to deceive is not enough, that you need something about to deprive the bank of its property interest.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, so it seems to me, Mr. Yang, that the real disagreement that you have is that Ms. Bell wants to equate and intends to deprive a bank of a property interest with an intent to have a bank suffer a pecuniary loss in the end.  She says those are the same things.  You say they're different things. Let's assume you're right.  Let's assume that that's -- that whether the bank in the end suffers a monetary loss is utterly irrelevant to the form of intent that's required by this statute.  All right? So you won that one, let's say.   Elena Kagan  Go back to the Chief Justice's question about how these instructions reflect that there needs to be an intent to deprive the bank of a posessory interest in property.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I thought I was giving you them.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Say, Mr. Yang, the instructions.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  They're kind of right.  It doesn't -- it doesn't parse neatly under either reading. But I have to say that if I'm a reader, the way I understand this is you have to -- you have to show -- the scheme has to be one to deceive a bank, to cheat a bank or to deprive a bank of something of value.  And in that case, the ""deceive a bank"" is operating as a disjunctive clause without the ""of something of value.""   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's to deceive a bank alone, cheat a bank alone, or deprive a bank of something of value.  And so I'm a juror.  I say, well, it's enough if the bank was deceived.   Elena Kagan  No, it's got to be that you're deceiving somebody.   Elena Kagan  Well, I don't think so because that would make no sense.  It would be the scheme must be one to deceive a bank of something of value.  Whoever would use words like that?   Elena Kagan  Well, I think it's more than grammatical.  It's just -- like, it doesn't make sense.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I quoted you it was, that it's an -- it's an intent to deprive the bank of a property, including a possessory interest.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  But the bank -- the bank has to have a possessory interest in -- a property interest in this thing.   ",15-5991
1,"Elena Kagan  Can you -- you keep on being cut off before you get to the tiers of scrutiny, but -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  -- the cases where the court has said that a lawyer has to be allowed to ask on voir dire about bias, does that -- is that only true of racial bias, or is that true of any other kind of bias as well?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think it's --   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  Is that -- is that right?   Elena Kagan  It's just race you're saying?   Elena Kagan  It's just race. And then Batson would be race and gender; is that right.   Elena Kagan  So the idea would be the judge would say, we'll look at all this other evidence v. the defendant.  I think that they would have found him guilty regardless.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that would be a kind of structural error.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Presumably --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Presumably the judge faces the same situation if a juror comes in during proceedings, is that right, and then the judge has to make whether this is something real or not.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Kovner, and it seems there are two lines of cases which -- in which we've recognized that racial bias in a jury room is an especially important problem, and that there need to be special rules to address that problem. And the first line of cases is the ones that on voir dire say that a lawyer who wants to ask about racial bias on voir dire has to be able to ask about racial bias, and that we've applied to nothing else except for racial bias. And the second is the Batson line of cases where we've said we're going to prevent lawyers from doing what we otherwise allow them to do when striking jurors will lead to -- may lead to race bias in the jury room. Now, here, we have like a screaming race bias in the jury room.  We have the best smoking-gun evidence you're ever going to see about race bias in the jury room, and notwithstanding that in these two lines of cases we've said there need to be special rules to address this prevalent and toxic problem in our criminal justice system, here, we're not going to do that. And the question is, why would this category of cases be different from those other two?   Rachel P. Kovner  So, Your Honor, we think this Court has never treated some Sixth Amendment violations as more serious than others, and to talk about these two lines of cases that Your Honor raises. If Your Honor looks at what, I think, the Court was doing in the voir dire cases, race was the particular issue that it confronted there, but it was indicating -- and I think it's indicated in other cases, you have to conduct the kind of voir dire that's reasonably calculated to detect the biases that may be present in a particular case. So those particular kinds of case involve the high risk of racial bias, and that's what why the Court said voir dire on race is required there.  And to -- to, I think, answer the question Your Honor asked co-counsel, I think the Court has applied that principle in other contexts. In the capital context, the Court has indicated under the Sixth Amendment you sometimes need to ask questions about ability to consider mitigation evidence, and lower courts have said that same principle requires voir dire on other topics. And then the second area Your Honor raises is the equal protection area, and we think even there, the Court has not distinguished among different types of constitutional violations and said we're going to treat some violations of the Constitution as particularly serious. What the Court said in those cases, we think, Your Honor, is that there has to be special care taken when the government acts based on race, and so some conduct that wouldn't be unconstitutional at all, if it were taken based on some other criteria, is unconstitutional when it's taken based on race.   Elena Kagan  It does strike me, though, that given that one of the rules is that a juror can, during deliberations, say something appropriate -- something inappropriate is happening here, to the extent that there is this chilling effect, and more -- why doesn't that produce the exact same chilling effect?   Rachel P. Kovner  Yeah.  I mean, I think --   Elena Kagan  I mean, it seems like it's such on the margins, what you're saying.   Rachel P. Kovner  I think, you know, for hundreds of years courts have treated the mid-trial context as different.  And I think a reason why is in that mid-trial reporting, you're really talking about something that sets off jurors' alarm bells at the time. Once the trial is over, not only do you have other interests kick in, in finality and tampering and harassment, but there's also just really the risk that jurors regret their decision in the case.  They start to second-guess what they did, and as a result they start to misremember, or they're subject to community pressures that aren't present when the trial is occurring. Your Honor, we're not suggesting that this is not a serious issue, and even one that jurisdictions, including this Court when it sits as a rulemaking body, can study and consider.  It's a difficult balance.  But what this Court has generally said with respect to rules of evidence is that states have a lot of flexibility on -- to adopt different approaches.  And we think this is a case in which the interests that the rule serves are fully present, and the safeguards that the rule has relied on historically are fully present, and so the Court --   ",15-606X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Yarger, let's -- let's assume that that's true, that the State interests are basically the same, and also let's assume that the safeguards, voir dire, don't operate particularly differently.  All right? So I'll just give you what -- what I think is the strongest argument on Mr. Fisher's side, which is that the -- that the interests in preventing unfairness of this kind are much greater; that that's really the difference, is the fact that verdicts based on race discrimination pose a harm that verdicts based on other kinds of unfairnesses, which exist in the world, and -- and are terrible, but still, that it's just not the same kind of harm.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The one question is whether identity-based harms are different than other kinds of unfairnesses, as we've talked about in the Warger case, for example, or the one before that. And then another question is whether race -- racial bias is different from other identity-based bias, right? But -- but would you -- would you concede that identity-based bias is different from like, you know, the kinds of bias that we've discussed in other cases?   Elena Kagan  But it's true that this is a Sixth Amendment case, but it seems artificial not to think about the Sixth Amendment issue as informed by the principles of the Equal Protection Clause.  And in those principles, as we've always understood them, says that there's a special kind of harm in treating people worse and, I mean, and certainly, in punishing people because of their race.  And maybe especially because race is so associated with particular stereotypes respecting criminality, that that's about the worst thing that you can do to a person, and it's also the worst thing that you can suggest about the criminal justice system, that it allows that to happen. So both of those two things, the harm to the individual for being punished because of your race, and the harm to society writ large.  And that would, I think, be the -- the fact, yes, you're right the State interests are exactly the same, and voir dire functions pretty similarly.  But it's just a different kind of harm.   ",15-606X
1,"Elena Kagan  Isn't there also something that Descamps says that -- that can be done, which is, you know, maybe you have a case and it just gives you the answer.  Maybe you have jury instructions and it gives you the answer.  If they don't, Descamps indicates in footnote 2 that you can look to the charging documents for the limited purpose of seeing whether the -- the prosecutor is treating the house or a boat as a means or as an element.  And sometimes that will be clear. I mean, you might have one set of charging documents, and it will say the person burgled either a house or a boat.  And then it will be clear that the -- that the thing is a means, and it's not an element.  Or another charging document can say, as to a houseboat, the person burgled a house, and then that indicates that Massachusetts law does treat this as an element and that you have to prove one or the other and that the prosecutor has made his choice.  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  These documents are a clue to whether something is an element or instead a means.   Elena Kagan  Sometimes they're a very good clue.  Sometimes they won't get you all the way there, but they're certainly a clue as to whether something is an element or a means.  And so you can look to the Shepard documents to try to figure out that question.   INTERRUPTING ",15-6092
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, I'm not --   Elena Kagan  -- sure that that's true, Ms. Saharsky.  I mean, you could take that Descamps law, and as Mr. Fleming did or some other way, essentially do the exact same thing with an explicit disjunctive.  The way Mr. Fleming did it, he said lawfully or unlawfully, you could say breaking and entering or not breaking and entering.  I mean, there would be a zillion ways of phrasing the exact same thing disjunctively on the face of a statute.  And I think Mr. Fleming is right that that would not have made a difference to our analysis.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Assuming that the component is an element.  So that gets you back to your first statement, which is that it didn't matter whether it was an element or something else.  A means was just as good as long as it's phrased in the disjunctive. And, you know, all of our cases -- it's not just Descamps -- it goes back to Taylor and Shepard and Johnson.  They all use the language of elements. Descamps in the introduction uses the word ""elements"" ten times.  So if we really meant elements or means or whatever, it's a funny thing -- it's a funny way to write all of our opinions.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you see, Descamps makes it quite clear that there's two different kinds of looking -- what Descamps says is you have to be able to say that a person was necessarily convicted of something.   Elena Kagan  Meaning that the statute requires him to be convicted of something.  It is not good enough to look at the course of proceedings and to infer that a jury or a judge actually did find something.  Descamps says this in no uncertain terms, that -- you know, I mean, sometimes those inferences can be very powerful.  And Descamps says it's not enough. That what you have to find is a necessary finding in the sense that a statute makes something necessary in order for a conviction to occur.  And that's the distinction between elements and means. And I'll just say one last thing.  And I know I've been talking for a while, so I'll let you talk.  But the entire discussion between the dissent and the majority was about this.   Elena Kagan  The -- the dissent said, it's really terrible what the Court just did.  It just created this distinction between elements and means. And the majority said, yes, that's exactly the distinction we're using, and we think it's the right decision -- distinction. So nine members of this Court thought that the distinction that we were using was a distinction between elements and means.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's not just footnote 2, if I could just interrupt.  I mean, the footnote 2 comes as a substance to the dissent, and the dissent says, this is the problem with the entire opinion, is that it keeps on talking about elements, but it's hard to distinguish between elements and means.  And we shouldn't be distinguishing between those two things. So the whole opinion is this elements focus, which then the dissent attacks.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If you need to.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, here, you have a particular statute, a particular State -- excuse me -- a particular State court decision that says exactly what is an element and what is a means and that this is -- this is not an element.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So you don't need to look any further than a dispositive State court decision on the subject.   Elena Kagan  Here's what the statute doesn't do.  The statute doesn't make it necessary for anybody to convict you of any single one of those things.  And one of the points, since 95 percent of cases end in pleas, the statute doesn't make it necessary for you to plead to any one of those things. So whatever information is floating around in these opinions, nobody has had to find -- and the defendant has not had to plead to a particular offense with one of those alternative means.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that's the critical thing under, not just Descamps, under all of these elements-based decisions, is that it doesn't matter what you did.  It doesn't even matter that you say you did something.  What we have to be able to say is that under the law, you absolutely -- the law required a particular finding that matches the generic crime.  And in this case, that finding is not there.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think --   Elena Kagan  Which is to say that elements don't matter, and that's the thing that is contrary to 25 years of this Court's precedents, because if this Court's precedents say anything, they say that this is an elements-based inquiry, which means that we have to decide whether something is an element.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that sounds -- that sounds very fact-based.  You look at the Shepard documents and you see what they actually did.  But this Court has said in no uncertain terms that that's not what we do. Much as -- much as some people think that that's an intuitive way to decide these questions, much as some people think that maybe we should have done that 25 years ago, but we don't do that.  We don't look at, let's look at the documents and see what the guy did. We say, let's look at the documents and see if he was necessarily convicted of something, meaning that the law required him -- the law required that a particular finding be made in order for this conviction to occur. And that's where your approach is something very different from what we've ever done, because you're saying that, notwithstanding that the law did not require that a particular finding be made, we'll take a look at the documents and decide that that finding was made.   Elena Kagan  But the point of the modified categorical approach is to take a truly divisible statute -- in other words, a statute with three separate elements in it, of which you only need to be convicted of one -- and to figure out whether the one that you were convicted of, the one particular element, matches up with the generic offense. It's not to do anything more than that. Descamps is quite clear on this -- on this matter, that it takes -- it's -- it's three separate elements.  Do you -- does what you were convicted of, is that the right element to match the generic offense?   Elena Kagan  Except that you say ""statutory alternatives,"" and I say ""elements,"" because for 25 years we've been saying ""elements,"" and that we can't do this inquiry if we're in the world of nonelemental facts.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Elements are what defines the crime.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the end of footnote 2 said in some cases you won't need to parse State law because you can figure it out from the Shepard documents, because Shepard documents are a clue to whether something is a means or an element. And so in the situation in which State law is not, as it is in this case, utterly clear on the subject, you won't have to go 1,000 layers down, because the Descamps -- the -- the Shepard documents will tell you, because of the way the prosecutor has charged something, looks like this is just a means, or looks like this is really an element.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, why wouldn't you look to State law? You have a State law that says exactly that this is not an element.  Why wouldn't you just take that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The only --   ",15-6092
0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Shapiro, you're asking us to ignore some extremely specific language in Dirks, which of course, was decided quite some time ago.  So I'm just going read in Dirks. The Court is talking about when it would be proper under the statute to convict somebody for insider trading, it's because there might be a relationship between the insider and the recipient, or an intention to benefit the particular recipient.  And then it goes on to say, ""When an insider makes a gift of confidential information to a trading relative or friend,"" and then in the last paragraph of the opinion, where it's really summing up everything that it's done, the Court says, ""The tippers received no monetary or personal benefit, nor was their purpose to make a gift of valuable information to the tippee."" So there's a lot of language in Dirks which is very specific about, it's not only when there's a quid pro quo from the tippee to the tipper, but when the tipper makes a gift to the tippee, and in particular a relative or friend.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  More than mention.  This is like half their holding.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't know what ""dictum"" -- what ""dictum"" means.  The court is very clearly setting out a test here.  And this is part of the test.   Elena Kagan  Ms. Shapiro, let me give you a hypothetical.  Let's suppose I would like to give a gift to a friend of mine, but it's just too expensive for me to give it.  And then I pass a coworker's desk, and I see a hundred dollar bill sitting there, and I take the hundred dollar bill; and now I can give a gift that I had wanted to give, but I couldn't. Now, have I benefitted from stealing the hundred dollar bill?   Elena Kagan  Yes, you have.  And why should the issue be any different if, instead of stealing the hundred dollar bill off my coworker's desk, I instead steal information and give the gift of that information rather than give a gift of cash?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think what I'm suggesting by the hypothetical is that we all have our own interests and purposes behind giving gifts.  Some of those might be very practical and pragmatic.  Some of them might be more altruistic.  But we give gifts for individual interests and purposes. And here, I'm stealing corporate information.  It's essentially a kind of embezzlement or conversion.  I'm stealing information to give a gift to somebody I know.  It might be, as in this case, a family member.  It might be a friend.  And I benefit from that because -- I mean, it's the -- I personally benefit. It's the exact opposite of using corporate information for corporate purposes.  I'm using it for my own personal purposes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. Shapiro, here is not a question of expanding it further.  You're asking us to cut back significantly from something that we said several decades ago, something that Congress has shown no indication that it's unhappy with, and in a context in which, I mean, obviously the integrity of the markets are a very important thing for this country.  And you're asking us essentially to change the rules in a way that threatens that integrity.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, I wasn't suggesting that there was -- there are easy answers to the question of what contributes to the integrity of the market.  I was suggesting that it's a reason for caution in changing a 30-year-old rule that everybody has understood and lived by, and that -- that Congress has shown no indication it's unhappy with.

Is it as strong as that?   Elena Kagan  Is anticipated the same as he knew he would?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it's not enough.  It's like, well, I think he might or --   Elena Kagan  -- or, you know, I'm sort of betting that he would, but I don't really know.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Dreeben, I get your -- your theory and why it doesn't make any particular difference.  And indeed, in that same paragraph where the Court says relatives or friends, the Court, just a sentence before, just talks about an intention to benefit a recipient --   Elena Kagan  -- without any sense of who that recipient has to be. On the other hand, as you say, almost all of these cases are relatives and friends.   Elena Kagan  And things might look different if we had a case that was not a relative or friend.  And why not separate out that strange, unusual, hardly-ever-prosecuted situation and say we're not dealing with that here? We have nothing to say about it.   INTERRUPTING ",15-628X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, why would Justice Harlan have wanted that distinction in the world of constitutional rules, because it seems to me Justice Harlan, as Justice Breyer suggested, would have looked at this and said, well, yes, but these -- this person or these 32 people could not -- it is improper for this person to be sitting in jail under any statute that Congress lawfully passed.  I mean, it might be that they could be sitting in jail under a different statute that Congress didn't pass.  But Congress didn't pass that statute, and that makes this sentence for this person improper, unlawful, under any measure. So why would justice Harlan have wanted to exclude those people from the protection that he suggested in Mackey?   Helgi C. Walker  What Justice Harlan was concerned about in Mackey was situations where the conduct at issue is immune from punishment.  Nobody is immune from punishment under the residual clause in the sense that they were engaging in constitutionally protected conduct, which is plainly what Justice Harlan was talking about. And it's not enough that this Court simply invalidates a statute.  We must ask why the statute was invalidated.  Was it invalidated for a reason that was based on a substantive or a procedural --   Elena Kagan  I understand your test.  I guess I'm just struggling to understand the reason behind it.  Because you said if -- if he weren't immune, if Congress could have passed a different statute, you know, coulda-woulda-shoulda, Congress didn't pass a different statute, and that means he's in jail unlawfully.   Helgi C. Walker  Well, one is in jail lawfully if, at the time the sentence became final, he was there under the law as it stood at the time.  We only apply new rules on habeas when they fall within this narrow category of substantive rules. And the notion that when this Court declares a statute unconstitutional, for any reason, that makes the underlying judgment or conviction or sentence unlawful and as if it never were, the void ab initio concept, going all the way back to the 19th century, has been rejected by this Court in its retroactivity cases. Linkletter explained that even when this Court invalidates a statute, the prior existence of that statute is an operative fact that cannot justly be ignored. So we've moved past, well past any notion where a law that has been declared subsequently unconstitutional simply disappears, and we must all pretend it never existed.   ",15-6418

0,"Elena Kagan  Let me ask you --   Elena Kagan  -- Mr. Ernest, sort of a similar question.  You -- here's two different kinds of bankruptcy schemes.  One scheme just says every time you distribute assets, you have to follow the following order: one, two, three, four, five.   Elena Kagan  That's -- and that's it. You just have to follow that order.   Elena Kagan  That's one Bankruptcy Code. Here's another Bankruptcy Code: It says presumptively, you have to follow one, two, three, four, five, but if there is a Pareto-superior solution, in other words, a solution in which some people are made off and nobody -- in which some people are -- get better outcomes and nobody gets a worse outcome --   Elena Kagan  -- if there is such a solution, you can go with that.  And that might be a completely sensible bankruptcy provision --   Elena Kagan  -- for Congress to have enacted.   Elena Kagan  The question is whether Congress did enact it and what you can point to in the Bankruptcy Code that suggests that the continual statement that it's just one, two, three, four, five is subject to a kind of equitable exception for Pareto-superior outcomes.   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Landau --   Elena Kagan  I mean, you might be right or you might be wrong about that.  Let's just assume that you are right, that -- that this is one of these extraordinary circumstances in which some people can be made better off and nobody will be made worse off. Still the question is, where is the authorization for that in the Bankruptcy Code? Because that's like a big principle.  I mean -- and I think we would have known about it if that's the way bankruptcy proceedings were supposed to go.  And -- and you suggest while it's in this ""for cause"" language, but this ""for cause"" language, I mean, this is a pretty specific provision that we're talking about. What it says is that when you can't reach a plan and the case has to be dismissed, this is attached to a provision that says everything has to be rolled back.   Elena Kagan  And -- and this says, well, not -- you know, maybe, if there is a good reason, not everything has to be --   Elena Kagan  -- rolled back to exactly the way it was. But that's a really different kind of provision than saying, in courts, you get to decide or -- or -- or parties, really, you get to decide, and then courts get to -- get to approve an outcome of a bankruptcy proceeding that does not follow the usual priority rules just because these particular parties, not all of them, but these particular parties think it will make some people better off without making other peoples worse off.   Elena Kagan  But then doesn't that run into -- this is what Ms. Harrington ended her remarks by saying, is that you're just saying the plans that the Bankruptcy Code declare not confirmable are, in fact, going to be confirmed through this alternative procedure?

Elena Kagan  So we really are looking to what Justice Breyer suggested, which is, we're -- we're looking to the movement of voters in and out of a particular district?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Even -- even if we concede that there were -- you know, essentially, all the African-Americans were moved in and all the -- the -- the whites were moved out.  It's --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Just if I -- so I can understand your sense of the relative strengths of your arguments, if we did remand, say, this is the wrong standard, go apply the right standard, and -- and that was done fairly, where do you think he would have to change his view, where do you think that there would be a question, and where do you think the same result would probably obtain?   Elena Kagan  I thought she won by only, like, 1 1/2 percentage points in the general.   Elena Kagan  Which you're saying, essentially, is idiosyncratic.   Elena Kagan  So are those --   Irving L. Gornstein  -- you're going to end up above 50 percent.   Elena Kagan  Are these the only kind of districts where you would say that a target would not have an impact on district lines? In other words, where the district has a population that's so far above the target that nothing that they're doing on the margins is affected by the target, are those the only kind?   Irving L. Gornstein  No, I would not say that, because I -- I would say districts, for example, like in this case where you start at 60, there's no -- no reason, necessarily, to think that race is going to predominate in order to bring the districts into compliance with the Voting Rights Act.  They started out at 60.  And let's assume, based on traditional redistricting factors and not on race, there's no reason that it couldn't end up on -- at 60 for the same reasons.   Elena Kagan  When, then, can you? What would be a case in which that might be possible? Not theoretically possible, but you can imagine it happening?   Irving L. Gornstein  So I -- I we have two examples in our brief, and -- and most of the cases I can think of are -- are -- are but variations of those. So the first relies on direct evidence from the mapmaker himself, and the second is where the State's nonracial explanation is discredited by the evidence to be more concrete.  If you have ten -- tens of thousands of predominantly white voters moved out, tens of thousands of predominantly minority voters moved in, and the mapmaker says, I did that to hit the target, then a finding of racial predominance could be made even if, Justice Alito, the -- the district was reasonably compact. And the -- the second example that I -- I would -- from the brief is, if the State says politics is what explains that, and then you look at the evidence and they used racial data rather than political data, then a finding of racial predominance could be made even if politics is also playing a role; and there's no conflict with politics in the drawing of the district --   Elena Kagan  May I ask, Mr. -- Mr. Gornstein, the -- the same question I asked Mr. Elias.  If we did vacate this on the grounds that that's the correct standard, what you just said, and that is not the standard that the district court used, what do you think would happen? You know, if -- if the standard that you just stated was fairly applied, would anything change?   Irving L. Gornstein  So we've only done a close analysis of three districts, as you can see from our brief.  And in -- in two of those three districts, we thought there was a pretty strong case, but not one where we could say it definitely would come out one -- one way or the other.   Elena Kagan  But a strong case that it would change?   Irving L. Gornstein  It would change.   Elena Kagan  And those districts are?   Irving L. Gornstein  Those are 71 and 95.   ",15-680X
0,"Elena Kagan  I thought, Mr. Clement, that the -- the 55 percent was based on a single district, 75; and that they said, okay, we've looked at 75.  You need 55 percent there.  And then it was applied across the board to every other majority-minority district without any granular analysis.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Isn't there something a bit strange about this kind of rule? And it's not to say that this kind of rule is the end all and be all. You -- it might be that you can have this rule and still be absolutely fine in the way that Mr. Gornstein suggested.  But the idea that you would look at 12 districts and say that every single one of them ought to meet the same BVAP standard without looking at the characteristics of those districts, who's in them, how they vote, I mean, it just -- it sort of defies belief you could pick a number and say that applies with respect to every majority-minority district.   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Clement --   Elena Kagan  No, please.   Elena Kagan  Just -- yeah, no, just going back to Justice Kennedy's question, it seems pretty clear to me that in the cases after Shaw -- because Shaw, you could have looked at it as, this is all about the way the district looks, and then in the cases after Shaw, in Shaw II, and in Miller, the Court makes very clear that it's not all about the way the district looks, and indeed --   Elena Kagan  If you look at Shaw and Shaw II and you look at Miller, and then you think about the -- the hypothetical that Justice Kennedy gave you, which is essentially -- maybe I'll change it a little bit -- it's essentially a mapmaker who says, look, we really want to do race-based districting here.  We can manage to do this in a way where the maps look kind of contiguous and kind of regularly shaped, but what we're doing is race-based decision making. Now, it seems pretty clear to me that if you look at Shaw II, if you look at Miller, that's forbidden.  And -- and -- and that's exactly the opposite of what the district court said here.   Elena Kagan  Well, then I'm with Justice Breyer, who suggested that a few years ago we took those concerns into account and we tried to figure out a test that was responsive to those concerns, and that is not the test that the district court used here.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Rashkind --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Rashkind, as I hear you now, you're saying something different from what I understood your brief to be saying, so maybe I just -- I understood your brief to be principally arguing that this was a consequence of Rule 4(b)(2), and so far, I haven't heard you mention Rule 4(b)(2)  Instead, what you seem to be saying is that regardless of Rule 4(b)(2), we should treat the initial judgment and the later judgment as though they are the same judgment. And 4(b)(2) doesn't have to exist for that argument to be correct.  I'm not saying that argument is correct, but it's a different argument than the argument I understood you to be making in your brief. So which are you making?   Elena Kagan  Did I understand you, Mr. Rashkind, to say earlier that you think you would have an argument even if 4(b)(2) didn't exist? In other words, and another way to say this is suppose we think that 4(b)(2) deals with a different situation from the situation that you're talking about.  Do you still have an argument --   Elena Kagan  -- or is it dependent on 4(b)(2)?   Elena Kagan  What's -- what's the argument that's exclusive of 4(b)(2)?   Elena Kagan  That might be true, but still, aren't we to wait until Congress fixes it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Presumably, Congress sees problems; Congress fixes problems.  And -- and you might be right that this is the kind of problem that Congress has fixed in the past, but that by itself doesn't seem to give us the ability to go fix it ahead of the time that they do.   ",15-7250
1,"Elena Kagan  I think in Mr. Rashkind's reply brief, he represents that there was no awareness of the opportunity to appeal.  I mean, the only thing that gives you pause in a case like this is just because usually, you only have to file one notice of appeal. You do get worried about, you know, traps for the unwary and a person who just won't understand that there's another stage in this process and needs to file a notice of appeal. As long as the Court is fulfilling its obligation of saying, okay, now, you know, if you have an objection to this, you need to file another notice of appeal, well, that solves the problem.  But if the Court doesn't say it, it doesn't solve the problem. And apparently, that's what happened in this case.  And Mr. Rashkind represents that his client didn't know of his opportunity to, or his need to appeal.   Elena Kagan  In the civil context, am I right that sometimes you file a second notice of appeal but you're -- the rules waive fees?   Elena Kagan  But not here? I mean, it's a little bit odd.  In the civil context, fees would be waived for the second notice of appeal and -- and in the criminal context not.   Elena Kagan  Mr. --   Elena Kagan  Where were you going?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, maybe this would be a good segue.  This -- this -- you understand the requirement of a notice of appeal to be jurisdictional. Do you understand the requirement of timeliness to be jurisdictional or not?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Now, I understand it doesn't matter in this case --   Elena Kagan  -- because you objected. But in the criminal context, that's a non-jurisdictional rule.  That's just a claims processing rule --   Elena Kagan  Is that correct? And are there requirements as to what counts as a notice of appeal? In other words, suppose I'm a defendant and I miss my 14 days, I don't file a notice of appeal within that time.  Actually, I don't file it later; I file a brief.   Elena Kagan  Does the brief count as a notice of appeal?   Elena Kagan  In certain situations?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  But assuming that that's not just applicable to pro se situations, I file a brief; I file it late; the government doesn't say anything about it.  The appeal goes forward?   Elena Kagan  Okay.

1,"Elena Kagan  Could I really quickly make sure I understand that, that in other words, you're -- you're saying we should only look to what an article of manufacture is and not your other argument that there should be apportionment as to any particular article of manufacture.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fletcher, could you speak about this VW Bug example, because as -- as I understand Ms. Sullivan's answer, she said, well, that distinctive appearance, that distinctive shape, it's just -- it's still -- the article is only the body of the car.  And -- and you say, no, there's a real question as to whether it is being -- the design is being applied to the car itself. So how would you go about thinking about that question, or how is a fact-finder supposed to, and under what instructions?   Brian H. Fletcher  So we think the basic question for the fact-finders, what's the article of manufacture to which the design has been applied.  We think the fact-finder should bear in mind this Court's observation in Gorham.  It's 1871, first design patent case that the -- what a design is, is it's the thing that gives the distinctive appearance to an article of manufacture. And the point we're making with the VW Bug example is that in some cases, that's going to be very easy.  If the patented design is for a refrigerator latch, no one is going to think that the latch gives the distinctive appearance to the entire refrigerator.   Elena Kagan  Right.  But let's talk about the hard cases.   Brian H. Fletcher  Right.  So the hard cases, like the Bug, one can reasonably say that it's either the body or the car.  Then we've given the Court four factors, and we think the fact-finder or a jury, if the jury is the fact-finder, ought to be instructed on those factors.  And so we say you should compare the scope of the patented design as shown in the drawings in the patent, how prominently that design features in the accused article, whether there are other conceptually distinct innovations or components in the article that are not part of or associated with the patented design, and finally the physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the article.   Elena Kagan  So you think that that question is not relevant to the first question.  In other words, suppose I think that people who buy VW Bugs buy them because of the look of the car.   Brian H. Fletcher  Yes.   Elena Kagan  But you think that that's only relevant at question 2 rather than at question 1, which is the question of whether it's the body or the whole car that the design is being applied to?   Brian H. Fletcher  I do.  I think that's the statute -- the way the statute reads.  It says you get profits from the article of manufacture.  And so, logically, I think the way to approach it would be identify the article and then let the patent-holder make the argument that even though the article may be just a part of the product sold -- and here, maybe it's just the case of the front face -- really, that's what sells it.  And so that that test still lets the patent-holder, in a case where it is the design of the article that's selling the whole product, still recover a very substantial portion of the profits --   ",15-777X
0,"Elena Kagan  Let's take a case -- and I think that the VW example is a good example for this reason -- where the thing that makes the product distinctive does not cost all that much.  There's not been a lot of input.  Somebody just -- some engineer or some graphic artist or whatever woke up one day and said I just have this great idea for an appearance.  But that's the principal reason why the product has been successful.  I mean, the car has to run, and it has to do all the other things that cars do, but the principal reason why the car has been successful has to do with this particular appearance, the design. As I understood the government, that does not come into the first inquiry.  That does not come into the question of what is the article.  It only comes into the second inquiry, which is how much of the profits are attributable to that article. Do you agree with that?   ",15-777X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Sloan, can I --   Elena Kagan  We wouldn't need that, would we, Mr. Sloan? We could say that the Briseno standards are in conflict with the old Atkins standards, as well as the new ones.  There wouldn't need to be a difference between the old ones and the new ones for you to win this case.   Elena Kagan  Could I just make -- I'm sorry to interrupt, Mr. Sloan, but could I just make sure I understand that? Because what you're essentially saying is that the court of appeals said, you are barred from using new standards; you must use the Briseno standards.  So the two are flip sides of the same coin, and what the holding was, is you must use Briseno standards. Now, your QP reflected their framing of the issue -- you can't use new standards; you must use the Briseno standards -- but you were just reflecting their essential holding, which is, we have this Briseno case and you have to use it.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Sloan, I think it's more than that.  Because it's not just you can't consult the current guidance and you have to go back to the '92 standard.  It says, you have to go back to Briseno, and Briseno has these seven factors that are not consistent with the old standards, just as they are not consistent with the new standards.   Elena Kagan  And can I ask whether you might be talking about two different things? And I might be wrong about this, but as I understand adaptive functioning, there are these particular areas of functioning that have been set out.  And what the consensus is, is to say, well, if you have deficits in four of these areas, it doesn't matter that you don't have a deficit in another area.  And that's what the consensus is. Now, within each area, people/psychologists can look at, you know, within an area --   Elena Kagan  -- to determine whether you have a deficit.  Yeah, you have to look at what you can do and what you can't do to decide whether there is a deficit in that area.  So the two things might not be in conflict at all.   INTERRUPTING ",15-797X
0,"Elena Kagan  General, would you agree with this: That the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals, in Briseno and other places, has made clear its view that -- that Texas can choose to execute people whom a -- a complete consensus, a 100 percent consensus of clinicians, would find to be intellectually disabled? Would you agree with that?   Elena Kagan  I'm -- I'm asking about Briseno and other court of appeals' decisions. And I thought that you said this in your brief, that the -- that your view of the point of State discretion is that a person who everybody -- every clinician would find to be intellectually disabled, the State does not have to find to be intellectually disabled because a consensus of Texas citizens would not find that person to be intellectually disabled. Isn't that the premise of the court of appeals' decisions?   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I just don't understand this.  And I really don't understand it in light of your brief, which I'm going to start to quote from pretty soon.  But what the -- it seems to me what the Texas court did is to say, look, we're going to accept the three dimensions, the adaptive deficits and the IQ and the age.  But with respect to the quality and the degree of impairment -- I think that that's their language -- we're not going to accept the clinicians' view so that people with mild impairment can be executed, even though the clinicians would find those people to be intellectually disabled.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I know that they applied the three-prong test.  The question is the degree of impairment as to each of these -- those prongs. And again, it seems to me pretty clear from your brief when you're talking about Atkins didn't establish a national standard, that you're saying too that the Texas -- and if you're not, I mean, I -- I guess I'm surprised by that -- that you're saying that the Texas courts do need to follow clinical assessments of intellectual impairment? Because that's -- it's just not what you say on page 19 and 20 and 21 of your brief.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, he was talking about my question. So go on. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  I have a follow-up unless you want to go, Justice Sotomayor.   Elena Kagan  Let me just take one of the Briseno factors, right? And it's the idea that what lay people think about the person growing up is relevant to an assessment of adaptive function. Now, no clinician would ever say that.  The clinicians say, no, that's sort of like stereotypical layperson view of adaptive functioning, which is different from the -- the clinical view of adaptive functioning.  But the Briseno factors made very clear, sort of point one, that you're supposed to sort of -- that you're supposed to rely on -- on what the neighbor said and what the teacher with absolutely no experience with respect to intellectual disabilities said. So that seems to me a very big difference between the Briseno factors and the clinical view of intellectual disability.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because Briseno says essentially that this can trump everything, and it says that this can trump everything because of the underlying view of Briseno and other Texas Court of Appeals cases that we don't have to look at the clinical standards and that we can execute people whom clinicians would find to be disabled.   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry, Mr. General Keller, because you keep on saying the three-prong definition, but the three-prong definition just tells you, you have to look to IQ, you have to look to adaptive functioning, you have to look to youth.  It doesn't tell you anything about what qualities you look to and the extent of impairment within those factors, and that's where the Texas court has insisted upon its freedom to go out on its own.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the -- but the genesis of these factors was that the court said the clinical standards are just too subjective and they don't reflect what Texas citizens think, both of those things.  They are too subjective, and they just reflect what clinicians think; they don't reflect what Texas citizens think.  That was the genesis of the standards, which suggests that Justice Kennedy is right about how they operate and also how they were intended to operate.   Elena Kagan  General, can I ask -- I'm sort of trying to reconcile the various statements you made here, and in your briefs, and here's what I come up with, and tell me if it's right. I think what you're saying is the Texas Court of Appeals is complying with Atkins because it used a three-pronged test, focusing on IQ and adaptive function and age.  But within each of those prongs, in order to make this distinction between clinical disability and moral culpability within each of those prongs, the Court can choose how to apply that prong, and particularly what levels of impairment to use. Is that a fair assessment?   ",15-797X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Englert, I guess I don't understand that.  I mean, let me take Justice Breyer's hypothetical and make it even simpler. Let's say that there's a contract and there is an explicit term, and it says I commit to providing a doctor's care.  Yes? And then it turns out that the medical care that was provided was not by a doctor.  It was by a nurse or it was by somebody with not even that set of qualifications.  And -- and then the person who enters into the contract makes a statement, demands payment, and says the care was provided. Now, some care was provided; it is true. But medical care, a doctor's care was not provided. Now, by withholding that fact and by just saying the care was provided, have I not committed fraud under the common law?   Elena Kagan  So I understood --   Elena Kagan  So what I understood you to be saying, Mr. Englert, was that all of these common examples, examples that really led to the False Claims Act, are not fraud.  So --   Elena Kagan  Well, let me just give you a few of them.   Elena Kagan  Justice Sotomayor said the government contracts to buy guns; the guns don't shoot. The government contracts to buy boots -- this was all within the context of the Civil War -- the boots fell apart after 12 hours.  The government contracts to buy food; the food was rancid. And each of those contractors would come in and would demand payment. And the entire idea behind this statute is that in that demand of payment is a representation.  The representation is that I've given you guns that shoot and boots that wear and food that can be eaten.  And when -- when that is not true, that is a fraudulent claim.  And you're suggesting that all these hypotheticals -- that somehow that's not a fraudulent claim.  And I guess that leaves me sort of wondering what do you think would be a fraudulent claim?   Elena Kagan  Well, if those are fraudulent claims --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- I -- I would think that this is the exact same, is that the contract was for a doctor's medical care, and a doctor's medical care was not provided.  A nondoctor's care was provided.   Elena Kagan  If I understand what you're saying, you're saying that in representing that you have satisfied the terms of the contract, you are -- or -- or -- let me say that -- I'll start it over. In demanding payment for having satisfied the contract, you are not representing that you are -- that you have satisfied the contract; that's your point? In demanding payment for satisfaction of the contract, you are not making a representation that you have satisfied the contract?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm not into every jot and tittle.  I'm into material portions of the contract.

Yes, he should have gotten a Certificate of Appealability because he has the merits on his side.  That's essentially what you would want us to do?

At least it would have been futile with Coleman still on the books.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Isn't this substantially different than Gonzalez? Wasn't it important in Gonzalez that the nature -- what the nature of the error was? In Gonzalez what the court said, the error is commonplace to -- lawyers misjudge time limits all the time.  The one thing we know about this error is that it's not commonplace.  Even the two people who called the Quijano as defense witnesses never themselves raised race as a cause -- as a reason for future dangerousness. Only this attorney who's been disciplined repeatedly for his malfeasance in representing clients, who one newspaper said if you want to ensure a death penalty, hire this lawyer.  In that situation, isn't this that rare case that Gonzalez talked about?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Keller, you know, some of the statistics that Petitioner have pointed us to -- in capital cases, a COA is denied in 60 percent of Fifth Circuit cases as compared to 6 percent of Eleventh Circuit cases, two roughly similar circuits where COA's are denied in capital cases ten times more in the Fifth Circuit.  I mean, it does suggest one of these two circuits is doing something wrong.   Elena Kagan  But this is the whole point, really.  They are not supposed to be doing what you do when you decide an appeal.  And they -- and they actually don't have jurisdiction to decide the appeal. I mean, they are supposed to be performing a gatekeeping function, not deciding the merits of the case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if you said that that's because those -- that's -- it's more prejudicial when the prosecution introduces this? Is that what you said --   Elena Kagan  -- to Justice Ginsburg? That -- that's your basic theory?   Elena Kagan  Yeah.  But -- and -- and that makes it more prejudicial.  That's your basic theory?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because I don't -- I guess if there's both points, tell me what the other point is because I guess I just don't understand that point.  But it seems more prejudicial when the defense attorney uses it. I mean, prosecution, you have a jury sitting there, and it realizes that the prosecutor has an interest in convicting a person and in getting a -- a sentence that the prosecution wants, so everything is discounted a little bit.  But when your own -- when the defendant's own lawyer introduces this, the jury is going to say, well, it must be true.  Even the defendant's lawyer thinks that this is true.  So, you know, who a.m. I to -- to argue with that? It seems wildly more prejudicial to me when the defense attorney introduces it.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  And the legal question here, right, is whether this ineffective assistance of counsel claim, which has never been heard by any court, is a strong one.  And a strong one including that the ineffective assistance here is likely to be prejudicial, which it seems as though it's -- it's far more likely to be prejudicial when the defense counsel does it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  People expect the State to use whatever aggravators it has at hand.  Now, people don't expect the State to do something as improper as this, but the people who understand that not everything that the prosecution says about a defendant, you know, that people -- the jurors should -- should think about those claims seriously because the prosecution has interests of its own.  But the defense counsel's interests are supposed to be with the defendant. I'm just repeating myself.  If the defense counsel does it, I mean, you know, who is the jury to complain?   ",15-8049

Then the Act, what it does, is it sets up -- this is why I -- I guess I -- I -- I can't readily agree with your understanding of it's all procedures and we just have to make sure the procedures are followed, because what the Act does is it sets up an administrative process.  And it says when you have disagreements about the provision of a -- of a FAPE, you go to this administrative process. And what does the hearing officer do? I'm going to just read you, subject to another exception, ""A decision made by a hearing officer shall be made on substantive grounds based on a determination of whether the child received a free appropriate public education.""   Elena Kagan  So that's what the dispute is ultimately going to be about.  It might be about some procedures along the way, and maybe it will be solved just by saying follow the right procedures, but often not.  Often, what the hearing officer is told to do, shall do, is to decide on substantive grounds whether a child has received a free appropriate public education.   Elena Kagan  But your substantive standard is so low, is so easy to meet, and then you justify that.  You say, don't worry about it because it's all in the process. But this provision, the idea of what a hearing officer is supposed to do, and then what a court is supposed to do, says it's not all in the process. There is a question of whether a student is receiving a -- a FAPE.   Elena Kagan  Well, how does your position, Mr. Katyal -- you have a passage in your brief on page 47 which says, ""An IEP must have the goal of advancing a child in the general education curriculum and, to the extent possible, enable her to be educated in the school's regular classes."" And, to me, that sounds exactly like what the chief justice just said, that an IEP has to be reasonably calculated to do those things.  And if it's not, then relief follows.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's wrong.  This is not just a procedural guarantee.  Yes, the IDEA has lots of procedures in it, but they're all geared towards a particular substantive result.  And it's that substantive result that's the focus of the -- both the administrative process and then judicial review of what comes out of the administrative process.   Elena Kagan  But if we --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- consider all of them and we do none of them, that's just fine?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal, can you go back to Justice Ginsburg's question that I'm a bit confused of -- about for the same reason. You said something like, well, this -- this standard is -- is being applied with bite.  So I'm just wondering, do you favor a standard with bite?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you favor a standard with bite?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Would that be ""some bite"" or ""somebite""? (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Well, again, if somebody said to you, write a stature with -- write a standard with bite, I doubt you would come up with the words ""more than merely de minimis.""   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the back end is what this case is all about.   Elena Kagan  We are at the back end.   Elena Kagan  And de minimis is not enough, you know.  It's ""merely de minimis."" (Laughter.)   ",15-827X
0,"Elena Kagan  How is your argument different from this tuxedo shirt that the government talks about -- it's on page 10 of the government's brief --   Elena Kagan  -- where the lines really do have to be just in a particular place on the piece of apparel in order for it to make any sense at all and, in there, that was found to be copyrightable? Is that -- is there -- there any difference between the tuxedo shirt and this?   Elena Kagan  No.  But it prevents you -- it prevents you from making this T-shirt with these lines on it in the same way that you're saying nobody should be able to make a short dress --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- with those particular lines in that particular place.   Elena Kagan  But you're saying you couldn't make the tuxedo shirt -- is that correct? -- or you could?   Elena Kagan  So but if I could just go back and make sure I understand my question about the tuxedo shirt.   Elena Kagan  If I have a copyright in the design of the tuxedo shirt, not in a tuxedo --   Elena Kagan  -- I have a copyright in the design of a tuxedo shirt, can I prevent other people from manufacturing tuxedo shirts?   Elena Kagan  So why isn't that exactly the same?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Because here, I have a design in a copyright dress, and now I'm trying to prevent other people from manufacturing that cheerleader dress with that design.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't understand why it's like manufacturing a tuxedo.  It seems as though it's like manufacturing the thing that I have the design in. I have design in the -- I have a design of a tuxedo shirt, so you can't make a tuxedo shirt.  I have a design in a cheerleader dress, so you can't make the cheerleader dress.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I guess that's the question, is it really in any way, because the opposite way of reading this statute is that the ""utilitarian aspects"" of the article that you're talking about in terms of the separability test?   Elena Kagan  That -- that those ""utilitarian aspects"" should be understood to encompass only the utilitarian functions that make something a useful article in the first place, which means that they should be held to exclude things that relate to the -- portraying the appearance of the article or things that relates to conveying information, and that seems to me a pretty good -- I mean, it's a confusing statute, but it seems to me a pretty good holistic understanding of this statute. But that is what this statute is trying to do, is to say there are certain kinds of things that might in a broad sense be considered utilitarian, which has to do with portraying appearance or conveying information, that, for this inquiry, we want you to exclude, that the separability test does not relate to those kinds of things.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the reason why camouflage is such a good example for your side is that camouflage actually -- we can understand it as having a utilitarian function that is different from simply conveying information and it is different from simply making something appear a certain way.   Elena Kagan  In other words, the utilitarian function that camouflage has is to hide you in the woods.   Elena Kagan  And so -- so that function would not be excluded by these things.   Elena Kagan  That's so romantic.   Elena Kagan  Well, what do you do in Mr. Bursch's examples of military uniforms or police officer uniforms, something like that?   Eric J. Feigin  So, Your Honor, those also are conveying information.  Now, if someone were trying to assert a copyright in the design of a policeman uniform in such a way that it turned out there were, say, only a limited number of ways to identify someone as a policeman and a copyright were being asserted to prevent identification of someone as a policeman, then the defenses that we discuss at pages 39 to 40 of our brief, the ""merger"" doctrine, the ""scènes à faire"" doctrine, would apply to prevent what would effectively be monopolization of that idea. So if that were really happening in this case -- and there are some reasons to think that's not actually happening in the cheerleading realm, and we discuss those in our brief -- if that were happening, those defenses would apply.   Elena Kagan  Well, that seems a problem. But on the other hand, it seems a little bit strange that, you know, take a garment designer who wants to do a design that is slimming.  And if -- there are all kinds of structural things you can do that are slimming, and those would not be copyrightable.   Eric J. Feigin  Correct.   Elena Kagan  Then you're saying that the -- that the placement of stripes or color, that is copyrightable, even though the garment designer is really trying to do the same thing through color and through graphic design as he was doing through the shape of the article.   Eric J. Feigin  So, Your Honor, I definitely think there is a spectrum here, but let me try to explain why I think this is on the expressive side of the line, not the non-expressive side of the line. If I were to wear a shirt that said ""Please focus on my very nicely toned arms.  I've worked very hard on them,"" I think we'd all understand the message conveyed by that shirt to be expressive and separable from the non-expressive functions that the shirt performs covering my body. Now, what -- the kinds of things that we're talking about here are essentially sending that same message, albeit in a nonverbal, more subconscious way, but they're still fundamentally expressive because they're about how the wearer is trying to portray themselves and their appearance to the world, and that's all that's being copyrighted.  That's traditionally within the domain of copyright.  It is not copyrighting a particular functionality.   Elena Kagan  Well, can't the school just go to somebody who puts the zigzag where the chevron was, or the chevron where the zigzag was, or makes it a couple of different colors or adds another stripe? I mean, there's this -- my clerk found -- I'm sorry.  Just add that --   ",15-866X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Jay, see --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Jay, can I --   Elena Kagan  And isn't it -- just starting from the premise that Justice Alito suggested, the -- fabric designs are copyrightable; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Everybody agrees with that.   Elena Kagan  So it seems to me that the question, right, in this case, is are you going to treat this kind of design just as you would a fabric design?   Elena Kagan  And as I understand Mr. Bursch's point, what Mr. Bursch is saying is, no, you shouldn't, because this kind of design has -- it -- it follows the figure of a human body, essentially.  And that's the difference between just a design of like stripes and zigzags and chevrons sort of abstractly, and then one that's put on something that looks like a particular piece of apparel that's meant to fit onto a human body in a particular way. And that seems to me to be the -- the distinction he's making, and I want you to tell me why that distinction, in your view, doesn't make a difference.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And when you say ""this design"" -- I'm sorry, Mr. Jay.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  When you say ""this design,"" just to make sure I understand what you're claiming copyright in, so if I'm looking at page 4 and there's this design with a blue stripe and a white stripe and a red stripe and a white stripe and a blue stripe, could somebody else come along and just add another red stripe to that? And would that -- would you then say you violated our copyright?   Elena Kagan  The particular arrangement. So if somebody just added a different, another stripe.   ",15-866X

And your version of this statute essentially allows a district court to negate that language.  It's as if that language were not there in terms of what the -- the -- the district court can do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, ""some sentence,"" you know, a day, six hours, whatever it is, but can essentially make that -- that disappear.  I mean, you know, it's concurrent plus a day.

The Congress did not say you -- it did not say what it said, in fact, in 1028A.

I mean, presumably, the guidelines reflect an idea that there shouldn't be any double-counting of the gun, right? So what does -- how does the court do the -- the sentence on the underlying crime, taking away the fact of the gun? In other words, most robberies have guns in them, and the sentences are written to reflect that they have guns in them, don't they? Aren't they?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What you think ought to happen is that the -- is that the judge should say, okay, imagine a robbery without a gun, what would be a reasonable sentence for that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, offense conduct, does that mean without a gun?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well that's where I don't understand your -- your answer to Justice Kennedy, because you said, no, you're not saying that 924 supersedes 3553.  I think you have to be saying that. You might still be right, but you have to be saying that there's this background principle, which is 3553, which is this parsimony principle and all these factors, and then 924 comes along and says, but not here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  One way you might look at this, and this goes back to what the Chief Justice said, he said, well, when there's a 30-year sentence implicated, you better be pretty clear.  And also when you're legislating against a fairly strong background principle of 3553, you better be pretty clear that you're displacing that background principle.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And here, you're just not -- you just have not been clear enough.  You were clear enough in 1028(a)  We know what that looks like.  But here, you just haven't been clear enough to upset this background presumption.   Elena Kagan  Counsel --   Elena Kagan  But I don't think you have to go to a principle of lenity for Mr. Stoler to be right.  I mean, you were just saying this is very much along the lines of what the Chief Justice was saying. You would just say something like, look, if we're going to be strictly textualist here, this does not have the kind of requirement you wish it had, which is to say it doesn't have the language that's in 1028A.  Your essential argument is that, read Mr. Stoler's way, this would utterly eviscerate (c)(1)(D)(ii), the consecutive requirement.  And I'm quite sympathetic to that.  But there's still this question of when a statute doesn't say what you would like it to say and you're reduced to saying if you read it the other guy's way, it would eviscerate what we -- what we meant when we passed another provision, you know, what -- what should we do and where do you point us?

I guess the question I have is whether in this context one should think that the word ""satisfy"" says anything. And -- and my question goes basically that in many cases, and probably in the vast majority of cases, no part of the judgment, including the full judgment, could possibly satisfy the fee award. So given that we're talking about a circumstance in which in the vast majority of cases the fee award is not going to be satisfied, why should we understand the word ""satisfy"" in the way that you think we should?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I agree with you that there might be some.  But the question is, you know, would Congress have used that -- the word in your sense, knowing that in most cases it wasn't going to be full payment?

If there is a non-medical facility that the state has reason to think is a -- is telling women about only one set of options and not another set of options, but here, the case would be they're only telling women about abortion providers, and they're not telling women about other ways that they may be able to complete their pregnancy, that the state could not impose a requirement that that facility post a notice saying, in fact, there are many kinds of facilities in the world and some are abortion providers and some are crisis pregnancy centers and some are something else, that -- that that would not be permissible?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess I'm not sure, licensed, unlicensed.  You -- you were suggesting that everything turned on whether a medical procedure was going to be performed. And my hypothetical was designed to take out the medical procedure; in other words, this is a facility that just refers women, but it refers women only to abortion providers. And the state decides we don't want facilities that refer women only to abortion providers.  We want facilities that will tell women about the full range of their options. And so the question is: Would a requirement that such a facility post a notice saying there actually are a lot of options and here's how you can access them, would that be unconstitutional?   Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Farris, can I ask -- you've been pinning a lot when you've tried to distinguish Casey on the idea of informed consent.  And certainly some of the requirements in Casey are informed consent in the way we would understand that, talking about the risks of various procedures, all the things that we want doctors to talk about when we go to them and seek medical care. But there were definitely requirements in Casey that don't have much to do with informed consent, as I've ever understood it. You know, the -- the -- the doctor having to inform patients about -- that medical assistance benefits may be available for childbirth in neonatal care, inform women that the father would be liable to pay child support.  So those kinds of requirements, they -- they just don't seem to have much to do about informed consent. And they are, and this goes back to Justice Breyer's sauce for the goose point, they're really the exact flip side of the requirements in this case.  So how am I supposed to think about that?   Elena Kagan  Well, I realize that that's a factual difference, that there's a doctor in the room, and in one case, there's not, but these are not informed consent requirements.   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Wall, why -- go ahead.  I'm sorry.   Jeffrey B. Wall  You've got to make an informed choice.  And all the government is saying -- we're not saying not goose for the gander; we agree.  What we're saying is the more you get away from that kind of a disclosure that's about what you're doing with that patient or customer or client, the more scrutiny it ought to get under the First Amendment.   Elena Kagan  But I think the question is why shouldn't there -- a state says, you know what, this is the regime we want.  We want to say to family planning clinics that they should put up a poster saying we do family planning; we do not do adoption. And we want to say to crisis pregnancy centers, along the lines of Petitioners here, we do adoption; we do not do family planning or abortion. And -- and -- and -- and -- and the state thinks that would be a good system because, when a woman goes in to either one of these kinds of places, they'll know what's there and they'll know what's not there. And what -- why would that be problematic?   Jeffrey B. Wall  Well, I think because once it's no longer tied to the specific goods or services that the -- the clinic or center or whomever is -- is providing, then the more we ought to be worried that they're making you just advertise what other people are doing. And this case is even one step beyond your hypothetical because it's not even saying to the clinics, say what you do and don't do.

1,"Elena Kagan  There is a -- a sense when you read this statute, Mr. Klein, there's at least a question that arises as to whether this statute has been gerrymandered. So would you speak to that?

In other words, if, you know, it's like, look, we have these general disclosure requirements, but we don't really want to apply them generally, we just want to apply them to some speakers whose speech we don't much like.   Elena Kagan  Well, could you say -- could you say a few words about how these boundaries came about? In other words, you have these various lines that the statute draws and then it has these exemptions. And what was the state thinking -- I mean, you know, and I realize that the state -- you know, there are lots of people who were thinking different things, but is there -- give me a little bit more about your theory of the case even as to why these exemptions exist and why these lines are drawn. You've been saying, well, we go where the problem is.  But tell me how you knew where the problem was.  Tell me how -- what you thought the problem actually was.  What were you doing? What were you trying to do?   Elena Kagan  I mean, one way to think about how a statute like this gets enacted is to say we're -- you know, we're really concerned that there are low-income women, don't have a lot of access to information, don't realize what all their options are, want to make sure in general and across the board that they get the best information that's available to them. Another way to think about what the problem is and how a statute like this comes about is more targeted.  It's to say there are these crisis pregnancy centers all over California and we know that women just go into them and they don't realize what they are, and they're being subject to being misled and we think that this is a terrible problem. And it might be that the -- you know, that the state could legitimately view that as a problem.  It's a much more targeted problem. Whether it's a problem or not, it's much more targeted than the first. And I guess what I'm asking is, is this the second kind of statute or is it the first kind of statute?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah, I don't -- I don't even remember which was the first kind of statute anymore and which was the second kind of statute.  But I was saying a state could really be responding to a sort of generalized -- a feeling that, in general, poor women don't have access to information, or a state could be responding to a -- a feeling that there are a particular kind of a center that is misleading women as to what they do and don't provide.

Elena Kagan  Well, suppose I said to you that a company was going to consolidate two offices.  Are they going to have two offices or one office?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So -- and it's not just laymen, right? I mean, if you look at Black's Law Dictionary, it says a consolidation in civil procedure, it defines as ""the court-ordered unification of two or more actions into a single action."" So that's the Black's Law Dictionary definition.  Same thing.  Two becomes one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, it did.  And -- and then, in Johnson, Johnson tells us that ""consolidate"" for the purpose of that predecessor statute did not mean a complete merger.   Elena Kagan  So Johnson is very much on your side.  But -- but Johnson was interpreting a statute which, although it similarly used the word ""consolidate,"" was different in other respects. And I'm wondering whether now that we're on a kind of blank slate, we have a new rule, it's different from the statute in a number of ways, why we have to keep on giving this quite unusual understanding of the word ""consolidate,"" why we have to keep on the same track; why we can't just say, you know what, ""consolidate"" means consolidate.  It means two becomes one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, there is -- lots of courts say, look, we're going to consolidate for some purposes but not all purposes.  And when a court does that, of course, it means something else.  It means just segments of these two lawsuits are going to come together. But when a court says we're going to consolidate for all purposes, I mean, just the usual understanding of that is, okay, now we have one lawsuit in front of us.  And that would have consequences as to what we think the final judgment is, when it comes, and when your appellate rights would kick in.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I know.  But where -- we kind of get to figure out what's right and what's wrong as to all these courts that are all confused.  That's why we're here.   ",16-1150

Elena Kagan  Could you also add 42(a)(3)? Because 42(a)(1) is about, you know, joint hearings and trials.   Elena Kagan  42(a)(3) says, look, you can also issue any other kind of order you want to minimize delay.  And then, separate from that, you have this consolidation provision.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Katyal, what do you think we should do if, on the one hand, we think your rule makes a lot of sense for cases that are consolidated completely for all purposes, but, on the other hand, we're concerned that this case should not have been? What should we do with that?

1,"Elena Kagan  But isn't that disjunction quite odd? Right? A typical anti-retaliation provision, you would think, well, if I report internally and I'm fired for it, then I get my protection. But here you're saying they don't get protection, except if they do something completely unrelated, they might have made a report to the SEC about a completely different topic, they might have made it 10 years earlier, and that's going to give them protection even though they haven't been fired for anything remotely to do with that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if I could just -- I guess I just don't understand what the theory is.  There are two employees, and they both internally report, and they're both fired. And one of them, tough luck, but the other one is going to get protection because he's filed a report with the SEC about some different matter entirely 10 years earlier. Why does he get extra protection?   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Michel, I do think that that's a real anomaly.  And I -- I -- I also think if you really look at the way this statute came to be, it's quite possible the way this provision gets in very late in the game, that they didn't know that they'll -- they forgot about this definitional provision, and they were meaning it more in the ordinary language sense. But there you are, you have this definitional provision, and it says what it says.  And it says it applies to this section. And you have to have a really, really severe anomaly to get over that. So what makes it rise to that level? It's odd; it's peculiar; it's probably not what Congress meant.  But what makes it the kind of thing where we can just say we're going to ignore it?   Christopher G. Michel  So, Justice Kagan, I'd direct you to the Lawson versus Suwannee Fruit case, which I think is often cited as -- as a canonical case on statutory definitions.  That was a worker's compensation case.  And the statute included the term ""injury,"" which was defined understandably enough for a worker's compensation case as injury on the job. But there was a provision in which the employer was relieved from liability if the employee had a preexisting injury.  And the Court said if you apply the statutory definition to that preexisting injury and require that injury to be on the job, that would be anomalous, because it would unfairly assign liability to the employer, and it would deter the statutory purpose of keeping employers from retaliating against disabled employees. So I think that decision is analogous here.  You would deter employers from -- excuse me -- you would unfairly apportion liability to employers based on conduct that they don't know about, and you would take out the premise of the retaliation provision, because the very conduct that is an element in the retaliation claim -- reporting to the Commission -- is different from the conduct for which they retaliated against the employee.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Fisher --   Elena Kagan  First, you had a second point you wanted to make, and then I have a question.   Elena Kagan  But I just wanted to hear your second point.   Elena Kagan  Here -- here's my question: Suppose that in this case the court had made very clear to your client the consequences of agreeing to sever.  In other words, suppose that there had been some kind of colloquy and the court had said: You know, if you agree to this, one of the things you're agreeing to is that there would -- you won't be able to get issue preclusive effect.  Would that be perfectly fine?   Elena Kagan  I mean, I guess the -- the reason I ask this is because it seems to me that maybe the problem in this case has to do with the fact that people just don't know what the background rule is, and that we could establish a background rule almost whichever way we establish the background rule and people would then be aware of the consequences going forward when they agree to sever.   Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. Ross, why not make sure that it actually is the defendant's choice? I mean, if it were, that would be one thing.  So why isn't the best rule a rule that says we're going to insist that some kind of colloquy takes place where the judge says to the defendant, you know, if -- if you want these two trials, here's the result of that; you lose the ability to argue issue preclusion? Why isn't that the best way to think about this kind of problem?   Erica L. Ross  So I think that's not the best way to think about this kind of problem, Your Honor, because the -- this Court's cases do not generally think about the double jeopardy right in those terms. So, in Dinitz, for example, this Court specifically held that a defendant's claim that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to have a double jeopardy claim was not for -- was not the right way to think about that issue because, in fact, the Court sort of presupposes that in these circumstances these are litigation decisions that may be difficult that may be made sort of in --   Elena Kagan  But your argument is all about voluntary choices on the part of the defendant, and you're essentially arguing a kind of waiver by conduct. And what I'm suggesting is if this is -- you know, if this -- if the way to think about this case is what is the defendant giving up when he agrees to a severance, then the obvious answer is: Tell the defendant what the consequences are, and ask him whether he's willing to suffer them.   Erica L. Ross  Your Honor, that might be one way to deal with the problem.  I think, as Justice Kennedy and Justice Breyer were suggesting earlier, if that is the way that is adopted, it is likely that many states would choose not to go through that process because, again, the -- this Court has made very clear that the introduction of evidence of a defendant's prior convictions is not itself a due process violation. So severance is not required as a matter of -- of federal law here.  And so I think if states are required to go through a knowing and voluntary waiver process, that then may -- I mean, we think those waivers would be completely enforceable, but I take my friend's argument to be that they might not be, in fact. And so some defendants would, in fact, challenge those waivers, and the state would be opening itself up on the back end to at least litigation and inefficiency that it does not need to open itself up to. I also think that in this case the most logical way to have looked at this agreement ex ante would have been for the defendant to know that he was giving up his right to -- to challenge the fact that these were held in one proceeding. So you can look at this a few different ways.  I think one of them is to think that this agreement was made so that the evidence of Petitioner's prior felony convictions would not come in at the first trial, but aside from that, nothing in this agreement was meant to or did, by -- by its terms, say that the other options for potential outcomes that would have been possible in one trial would be off the table. So, as some of the discussion earlier suggested, had this happened in one trial, Petitioner could have been convicted on all offenses, acquitted on all offenses, or some mix thereof, and nothing about saying I want to have two trials so that this other evidence doesn't come in logically suggests that he's retaining the option to keep one of those from happening.   Elena Kagan  Well, but maybe the defendant understands that we in our Double Jeopardy Clause have -- have emphasized pretty strongly the value of acquittals, and that acquittals mean something in our system, and they preclude the government from doing certain things that are inconsistent with those acquittals. So I guess -- I guess I don't -- don't understand why, in the absence of a colloquy, and given the backdrop of double jeopardy law that focuses so much on not doing anything that's inconsistent with acquittals, the defendant would, of course, know that he was giving up his right to issue preclusion?   Erica L. Ross  Right, Your Honor.  And I think that this goes back to some of the discussion that Justice Alito was having earlier, which is to say that the question in this case, I think, is -- is best conceptualized as: What right did defendant agree not to invoke and what is he trying to invoke now? And I think that what this agreement said was that I'm going to have multiple trials.  And so what the Double Jeopardy Clause protects is multiple -- against is multiple trials for the same offense. And so, when Petitioner made that agreement, he was essentially saying I'm not going to fight later about this is one -- whether this is one offense or --   Elena Kagan  Well, but --   Erica L. Ross  -- multiple offenses.   Elena Kagan  -- then you're saying, when you say the Double Jeopardy Clause protects multiple trials for the same offense, that's one thing that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects. And another thing that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects -- and this is the difference between the claim preclusion aspect of it and the issue preclusion aspect of it -- is the preservation of acquittals. And that's what is involved in this case.   Erica L. Ross  So, Your Honor, I would just note that the way that the Double Jeopardy Clause protects acquittals is in two specific ways, and we lay this out in our papers. On the one hand, as everyone agrees here, following an acquittal, a defendant cannot be tried again.  So he can't -- on that particular claim, he cannot -- the government cannot appeal.  There cannot be another trial. Everyone agrees that's being respected here. The second way that this Court's decisions in the Double Jeopardy Clause protect acquittals is by modifying the definition of the same offense for purposes of the multiple trials analysis. So what -- the way that we give finality to an acquittal is by saying that, in fact, that acquitted offense was the same offense as another offense that is technically distinct for charging purposes. And in this case, when --   ",16-1348
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Well --   Elena Kagan  mean, it's one thing to say, as we've said many times, that when you say I want two trials, that what you've given up is the right to object about two trials.  Right? That really is inconsistent.  If you're insisting on multiple trials, or preferring multiple trials, then you can't assert your right against multiple trials. But that's not this case.  Somebody can say I want two trials and still have it in his view that, in that second trial, normal issue preclusion principles will apply.  So sometimes that will prevent the second trial, but sometimes it won't prevent the second trial because the government can prove its case another way. And so there's no inconsistency of the kind that exists in claim preclusion in this kind of case, is there?   Elena Kagan  Well, I don't -- I don't understand what that means.  The -- the Solicitor General says that as well in its brief, and I didn't understand that either, because surely the government doesn't mean that if the government couldn't prove their case another way, the government could try to do so. Right? I mean, if the government could prove their case another way, then the trial isn't barred.  Right? The trial goes forward with the government proving its case another way.   Elena Kagan  Well, whatever you call it, the point still stands that the defendant is in a position where it's perfectly consistent to say two things: Yes, I would like two trials, and in that second trial, I expect that issue preclusion principles will apply. That's very different from the kind of inconsistency that we've pointed out in the past, where the government can't -- the person can't say on the one hand I want two trials and say on the other hand I don't want two trials.   Elena Kagan  Well --   ",16-1348
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement --   Elena Kagan  -- you said the literal meaning.  And you have some good arguments, but I have to tell you I don't think that that's the best one of them. Just if you think of what servicing means -- this is one dictionary, but basically all dictionaries say the same thing -- it means to perform services of maintenance, supply, repair, installation -- as to service a car. So it actually means to do the work, to do the repair, to do the maintenance -- I think would be the most ordinary understanding of what servicing means. So it does seem as though, for all the arguments that you do have, that one cuts against you, that, you know, just the ordinary meaning of what it means to be engaged in servicing automobiles is to be repairing, maintaining, fixing cars.   Elena Kagan  So I -- that is one of the better arguments, I think, is what -- what ""partsman"" is doing in this, but I think I'm still suggesting, before we get on to that, that if you took partsman out of this statute, I don't really think that you'd have a leg to stand on here, that we would just naturally mean, well, servicing automobiles is like fixing them. And what -- and the service providers, they have something to do with servicing, to be sure, but they're not doing the servicing. What they're doing is selling service products.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  One of the amicus briefs talks about what partsmen did historically and makes the case that what partsmen did when this statute was passed is a little bit different from what -- or a lot different from what a partsman does now, in the sense that when this statute was passed, there were not readily available, ready-made, off-the-shelf parts.  And what partsmen really did was kind of get under the hood and try to strip engines and play with the parts and adjust parts.  And, you know, it was very much more part of the repair process than somebody who was taking things off the shelf.   Elena Kagan  So can I try a hypothetical on you? And the hypothetical statute is designed to match this one in structure and -- and -- and to present the same question.  So here's the language: Any salesman, designer, or seamstress primarily engaged in selling or making dresses.  All right? So there we -- we know the seamstress is involved in making dresses.  We know the salesman is involved in selling dresses.  The designer is the partsman.  And you could say, look, the designers, they're not actually sitting there with the needle, but they're still sort of making the dresses.  That's the partsman. And then the question is, would you really say that the salesman is making the dresses too?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Clement --   Elena Kagan  Could we --   Elena Kagan  Could I ask your indulgence --   Elena Kagan  -- and just before you talk to -- about purposes? Just, you know, my -- what my hypothetical was designed to do, and I came up with a bunch of them and I'll spare you -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  -- is to have a three-to-two correspondence.  Your answer back to Justice Breyer was right away: Well, your hypotheticals have a two-to-two correspondence and that's different. My hypothetical had a three-to-two correspondence and you had to do a little bit of stretching to get one of the -- the middle term in. But the question is does that force you to stress -- to stretch so much that you get the first term in, when the first term pretty naturally pairs with the other, with the -- with the selling word, and that's what you're asking us to do. And I think to put the point more generally, the fact that you have to do a little bit of stretching to get partsmen in does not compel you to do a lot of stretching to get salesmen in.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Now you're daring me. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  When I think of these three categories of workers, so service providers, partsmen, mechanics, to coin a couple of silly kind of words, a service advisor is customer-facing.  You know, it's -- the -- the primary -- the primary job is to deal with customers, to sell them things, to liaison with them, to make sure they're happy. Mechanics, and also partsmen, are car-facing.  You know, their job is to do stuff with the car.  And, you know, in different ways, the partsman is more helping, but their -- their focus is on the automobile, whereas the service provider's focus is on the customer. That seems to me a pretty big divide, suggesting that the service providers are really, you know, salesmen, not servicers.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is -- is everybody who's in a service department -- does everybody count as primarily engaged in servicing automobiles who's in a service department, the receptionist, the filers?

Elena Kagan  Mr. Feldman, when -- when you talked about the purposes, you focused on the fact that service advisors work on-site and don't work irregular hours.

That person has been given permission by the renter to be in possession and control of the car. It's true that there's a contract violation, but the contract violation, let's be frank, is not uncommon.  Some courts have even said that these contract violations are foreseeable.  And -- and it's understood by everybody as relating to insurance liability, not to privacy. So what eliminates the right of privacy that you would normally get by opening up the car of a door and sitting in the front seat and turning the ignition key?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Justice Alito's question is very much related to mine, because there are all kinds of contract terms where if you're -- if you're sitting behind the wheel of a car and you're -- you're driving on gravel, you're in violation of the contract. You know, there are tens of them.  So why is this one any different? Why does this one eliminate what you would normally get by being in that car with the permission of the renter?

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Dvoretzky, if I could come back to Justice Alito's question because, in answering Justice Alito, you say we don't look to Mr. Sveen in particular, even if we know a lot about him.  We look to this broad class of people who are in this situation. And if that's true -- I mean, I guess I had sort of conceptualized your argument as the exact opposite.  Well, we don't know anything about Mr. Sveen, so even if it's true that people generally want to give their life insurance policy to their children, that doesn't matter because we don't know that about Mr. Sveen. But if you're saying: Really, we look to the broad class of people, then why shouldn't the broad class of people that we look to be -- you know, why shouldn't we make the same judgment that the -- or -- that the legislature made or at least accept that judgment that if we look to the broad class of people, most of them would rather give their life insurance policy to their children than to the -- their divorced spouse?

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Chesler --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Chelser --   Elena Kagan  I don't think that that's right, Mr. Chesler.  I mean, I think that the Discover issue is about protecting low-cost products because the reason that we've -- that we've said vertical restraints are often perfectly fine -- indeed, better for competition -- is because it allows us to have some high-cost products and some low-cost products.  High cost/high service, low cost/low service. The problem here is that the effect of these anti-steering provisions means a market where we will only have high cost/high service products.  And any competitor that wants to come in and says, you know what, we want to compete in a different way, we want to compete in terms of cost, is going to find itself unable to do so. And that's the thing that makes this vertical restraint, it seems to me, different -- different from others.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Chesler, if I'm a consumer -- I mean, it might be that I'm very altruistic and I just care about my local coffee shop and the kind of deal that the proprietors are getting, but more to the point, what I really care about is if that local coffee shop can past on -- pass on its decrease in price to me. And that's exactly what the anti-steering provisions prevent.  It prevents the vendor from passing on the lower merchant fees to the consumer.  And as long as that's the case, you're just not going to be able to construct a business strategy based on a low-cost card.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And this is exactly -- I mean, this is not me making this up.  I mean, there was a seven-week trial.  And that's exactly what the district court found.  And these are findings of fact about Discover, about the effect of -- of -- of -- of this anti-steering provision on the actual state of competition in the market, meaning on the ability of low-cost cards to compete.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Chesler, what the --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Chesler, I don't -- I don't have 42 years of antitrust experience, teaching or practicing, but --   Elena Kagan  So I just think of this in sort of simple-minded ways.  Here's what the district court found.  The district court found that merchants cannot steer customers to cheaper forms of payment.  The district court found that all of the credit card firms have consistently raised their prices. Even when you look at these two-sided prices, the district court found that these price increases were not being passed on to consumers.  And the district court found that it was impossible for a credit card company that wanted to offer a low cost/low price product to enter the market. So you put all of those things together, that sounds like a market that is not working in the way it's supposed to, at least sufficiently to get on to the second step where you can make all your arguments about why it is that a market where the prices only go up and where no low-price competition can emerge is, nonetheless, a good market.   Elena Kagan  Well, it's the one hand where the government has the burden.  And now, if you want to come in and you can say, look, there are all these great benefits that go beyond -- I mean, some of your benefits sort of seem to me to be benefits for American Express only.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Messenger, may I ask you about reliance interests here? I don't think that we have ever overruled a case where reliance interests are remotely as strong as they are here. So just a few things to put on the table.  Twenty-three states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, all would have their statutes declared unconstitutional at once. Thousands of municipalities would have contracts invalidated.  Those contracts probably cover millions, maybe up to over 10 million, workers. So property and contract rights, the -- the -- the -- the statutes of many states and the livelihoods of millions of individuals affected all at once. When have we ever done something like that? What would be the justification for doing something like that?   Elena Kagan  But that would be to flip our usual stare decisis doctrine.  Our usual stare decisis doctrine makes it quite clear that reliance is an important consideration on the scales.   Elena Kagan  Well, why is that? How many of these contracts have severability clauses, do you know?   Elena Kagan  Of course, even if that's true, presumably they're bargained-for provisions.  The contract would have been different if the unions and the employers had known that this was going to be declared unconstitutional. So to leave the contract as is, except for one particular bargained-for provision, is to do something that's inequitable for the union.   Elena Kagan  Please.   Elena Kagan  General, an important part of Mr. Messenger's argument is the idea that all speech about employment conditions, about pay, about vacation, you know, about all of the various employee benefits that -- that are subjects of collective bargaining, that are really the heart of collective bargaining, that all speech about that is -- are matters of public concern when it happens in the public workplace because they all cost money and, as taxpayers, we would be interested in things that cost money.  Is that the government's position as well, that all of that speech is a matter of public concern?   Elena Kagan  Can I ask -- it strikes me as a very unusual position for the government to be taking, looking after the long-term interests of the United States government, because essentially what that means is that you will have to litigate all employee/employer disputes under the --   Elena Kagan  -- second step of Pickering rather than under the first --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- which is quite a striking thing for the government to be saying that it agrees with.   Elena Kagan  So you're saying that when a union collectively bargains, it's a matter of public concern but that if employees in their workplace, 10 or 20 of them, get together without the formal collective bargaining that a union does, that that's not a matter of public concern?   Elena Kagan  Well, that union is a representative of the employees and has been chosen to represent the employees so that the employees can better wield their power --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- over terms and conditions of employment.  So why should it matter -- I mean, that's -- I'm -- I'm trying to understand this because it struck me as a quite amazing thing --   Elena Kagan  -- for the government to be saying that these were matters of public concern.  Why should it matter if 50 employees get together and say we want higher wages and then, on the other hand, if employees get together and say, you know what, we think it's right to elect a union so that the union can say that, it's the exact same subjects and the exact same speech that's going to be involved.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Heytens, you also agree now, don't you, that the probable cause hearing is part of the criminal case? That's not at issue here?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So then, if I just look at the language of the Self-Incrimination Clause, it's ""shall be compelled in any criminal case,"" which we are in now, and -- and there's no issue here about compulsion.  Maybe there should be, but there isn't. ""Shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself."" ""To be a witness against himself,"" if I'm just thinking about the natural reading of those terms, it's when my testimony is introduced adverse to my interests in that criminal case. So why isn't that just what we should be asking?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Kind of the obvious interpretation, right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I don't think Estelle is -- is inconsistent with that because what the Court in Estelle said was that this is actually a neutral determination.  And that's understandable when you consider that the victory you win when you're declared incompetent is to continue to be detained as incompetent. So it's -- it's -- it's not like here where it's like: Well, obviously -- obviously, I want to win this so that I can get out of this criminal case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.  I mean, you're quite right that there's a -- if you are right that the grand jury is different, and you might be, that there is a kind of anomaly there, but explained, I think, by a kind of historic judgment that grand juries are sacrosanct, that everything has to be secret, that we don't want people poking around in that black box, and none of that is true of just standard probable cause hearings.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Ms. -- Ms. Prelogar, I -- I guess that would mean as a conceptual matter, even if not as a practical matter, but as a conceptual matter, that the government could force somebody to testify against himself in such a proceeding?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, to be clear, Justice Kagan, we think that a defendant in that situation would still -- would still have a valid privilege against self-incrimination because he could reasonably fear that anything he says in that probable cause hearing could then be used against him at the ensuing trial to prove his guilt. So a defendant could invoke his privilege to prevent that testimony.  And at that point, the only way the government could compel the defendant to speak would be to formally grant him immunity.   Elena Kagan  Yeah.  So this is why I said maybe not as a practical matter, but as a conceptual matter, you would be saying that the government could, if it chose and if it accepted certain consequences, could force him to testify against himself?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Only by granting that immunity and --   Elena Kagan  Right.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  -- as this Court has recognized in the immunity cases, by then conveying on the defendant and conferring on him that --   Elena Kagan  How about this? How about if he didn't testify? Could -- could the government draw an inference against him for failing to testify, as the government could, for example, in a civil case?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think that the government could draw the adverse inference, but I think the inference would only matter if the government had already come forward with sufficient evidence to show that you would expect the defendant to respond to that and to speak at that hearing.  And at that point, I think the government has already proven probable cause.  So I can't imagine any case where it would make a difference to draw an adverse inference against a defendant in that situation.   Elena Kagan  Yeah, I guess my questions are just that it seems odd for something that is understood to be a part of the criminal case, I don't -- I -- I -- I take it that you have no continuing objection to that view either --   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  That's right.  We think this is part of the criminal case.   Elena Kagan  So, you know, it just seems odd for something that is -- is clearly part of a criminal case to say: Yes, the government can draw an adverse inference, but don't worry, we won't, it will never come up; and, yes, the government could force him to testify against himself, but don't worry, we would have to give him immunity and we -- and we wouldn't want to do that. It just seems conceptually a difficult position.   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  Well, I think that the reason we think that that is so and that those things are permissible is because the consequence of that probable cause hearing is simply an interim step in the criminal procedure that will -- that will then go on to the criminal trial. And I think that in the context of that proceeding, where the defendant's not exposed to the risk that those statements are going to be used for the really consequential things, for guilt and punishment, he hasn't functioned as a witness against himself --   Elena Kagan  Ms. Prelogar, suppose we rule against you on this issue.  Do you think that had -- that that would have necessary consequences for any other kinds of proceedings?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I think it would depend on the basis on which this Court ruled against us. Now I understand that Respondent has suggested some ways to narrow what I understand to be the Tenth Circuit's rule in this case where, as I read the Tenth Circuit's opinion, once you're in the criminal case, all proceedings are covered. And Respondent identifies some limiting constructions that I think would limit the number of procedures to which the rule would apply, looking at things like what is the legal issue being resolved in the case and what is the potential consequence. So, in that sense, I think that the Court could write an opinion that narrows down on the probable cause hearing that was at issue here.  But, ultimately, if the Court were --   Elena Kagan  And how about -- Mr. Heytens spent some time talking about Gerstein hearings. Do you think that this is the same -- identical to Gerstein hearings so that whatever we did here we would have to do there, or do you think a distinction can be drawn between the two? In other words, if you -- if we rule against you, will the government come back the next time and say, Ah, we lose now, or will you have a good argument to make?   Elizabeth B. Prelogar  I'm -- I'm sure we would not lose, or hopefully not.  I think the argument we would make would then look at the purpose of the Gerstein hearing and would say the purpose there is to determine whether pretrial detention should continue. And that would be a different purpose than the probable cause determination, which is a bind-over determination.  But I think actually that focus on purpose shows why we should prevail in this case, because the -- the purpose of this proceeding is fundamentally different and fundamentally distinct from the kinds of issues that a defendant will face at trial, and from --   ",16-1495

One way you get all the hospital and medical costs that you incur, and the other way you get those costs minus any recovery in a tort suit.  So maybe a recovery won't happen in a tort suit, but a recovery might happen in a tort suit and then you get considerably less.

No.  I'm saying you don't have to convince us, because -- because one of the things that we've said over and over about structural error is that it's -- it's impossible to show how they affected the trial.   Elena Kagan  And -- and that's really what's at issue here, is whether we should put the defendant to the burden of showing how it affected the trial, when, in fact, we've said over and over that you can't do that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So whether they're important, whether they're not important, whether they're critical to fundamental fairness or not, you know, is, in some ways, beside the point.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I thought your understanding of Batson was that you were saying when an attorney is deficient, as respects to a Batson claim, there, too, you would say that -- sort of too bad.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Yes.  But you -- you still must satisfy the prejudice prong in order to rerun the trial.   Elena Kagan  But that's the underlying violation of the ineffective assistance claim.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Correct.  Correct.   Elena Kagan  And you would say the same rule would go, and you have to prove prejudice.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Correct.   Elena Kagan  Even though we've said over and over that you can't prove prejudice.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Well, I think on that point, Justice Kagan, the idea that you can't prove prejudice, the Court said it's difficult to do.  That may be true as a general matter; it's not true across the board. We've cited cases in our brief with respect to the bias trial judge structural error, for example, where courts have done a case-by-case inquiry and said, okay.  In this case, the bias of the trial judge, there is a reasonable probability it would have affected the trial outcome.  In this case, there is no reasonable probability that it would have. And it's not -- the -- the burden of proof in the Strickland context is on the defendant --   Elena Kagan  You know, I'm not saying that there aren't cases where you can have a sort of gut intuition as to whether it did or not.  But one of the things that have made us put these particular rights in this box called ""structural"" is that we say, you know, notwithstanding that you can pick out a case here and there and say, okay.  I kind of know. In general, these are -- it is so speculative as to whether this fundamental defect in the trial process caused error that we're going to -- to -- to presume it.   Ann O'Connell Adams  And -- and so that, Justice Kagan, is the rationale for -- for not letting the government prove harmless error if the objection is preserved.  And I think a big part of that is that these interests -- a lot of these interests are ones that would not adequately be protected if that rule was not dispensed with in the harmless-error context for preserved objections. I think the most stark example is a McCaskill error, the right to represent yourself, where if we didn't exempt that type of an error from harmless-error analysis, it would always be harmless, because the judge could just deny the motion and then say, well, there was no prejudice because you would have -- you would have been worse off representing yourself. In the Strickland prejudice, the -- the tables are turned and the defendant has the burden to prove that there was some sort -- there was a reasonable probability of a different outcome at trial had this error been objected to and been fixed.  And there's -- there's just no reasonable probability of that in this particular case.   Elena Kagan  I don't think we've ever really talked about burdens when we label things structural errors.  You know, we don't say, oh, you haven't met your burden.  I mean, what we've said is that the whole burden analysis kind of goes out the window because this is so hard to prove because it's so speculative. So it's really not a question of who has the burden.  It's just never been the way we've addressed the structural error category.   Ann O'Connell Adams  I -- I think in -- in Strickland, it's clear that the -- the -- proving each prong of Strickland deficient performance and prejudice is on the defendant.  And so, I guess, it is our position that even though it's difficult to prove -- I mean, the test is not meant to be easy.  We're looking to identify cases where the error, the attorney's error --   Elena Kagan  Well, it's not meant to be easy, but it's meant to be possible.  And what we've said in our structural error cases is that it's not possible in a very, very large proportion of them.   Ann O'Connell Adams  Well, I guess I'd like to push back on that a little bit, though, and -- I mean, I could give an example in the public-trial context in specific where, you know, a lot of times when this particular right is at issue or is violated, it's with respect to the courtroom closure for one witness, say an undercover police officer, a rape victim, a child, or something like that. And if -- you know, if the courtroom is closed for that witness's testimony and there's no objection, and on appeal, the -- the court of appeals says, oh, well, that was a -- that courtroom closure was unjustified under the Waller factors.  And if that witness didn't testify or wouldn't have testified to those things but for the courtroom closure, you could absolutely evaluate that and see if there was a reasonable likelihood the trial would have come out differently had that witness not testified. So I -- I don't think it's the case that -- it may be a general rule across the board that structural errors are difficult to prove, but I don't think it's true in every case.   ",16-240X

And that's a pretty important thing to be concerned about.  And we have said as part of Strickland that you have to show prejudice, because we're not really concerned about lawyers, however bad they may be, who do things that just don't affect the reliability of the trial. But here, with respect to these structural errors, what we've said again and again and again is we actually just don't know.  So the -- in any particular case, whether the commission of this error affected the outcome. So what you are suggesting to us is that the defendant has to come in and prove as part of Strickland -- which, as I said, is integral to ensuring the fairness and reliability of the process -- has to come in and prove as part of that something that we have said, time and again, is unprovable.  And that just seems like that's not something that a legal system should do.  You have to prove something that we've admitted is unprovable.

And so I think if you actually compare the language of the 1954 treaty and the language of Article 10(a) in French, they are virtually identical. It was just the drafters carried it over.  And that that's the way that people understood it. On a practical level I do think that ""send"" is just a very natural way to refer to putting something in the mail, and so it makes sense to use that verb there rather than a different verb, especially when you're talking about a situation in which the service can go directly from one party to another. We think the contrary interpretations really don't work here, but at the very least there's ambiguity in this treaty, and at that point this Court's decisions are clear; you turn to extrinsic sources of information. Here, each and every extrinsic source points strongly in the direction of the interpretation we're espousing. You have the -- the history, and that is the draft convention and the contemporaneous understanding of people who were there when it was drafted.  You have the consistent interpretation of the executive, which is entitled to great weight, and here, has been completely consistent from the beginning till now.  You have the consistent interpretation of other contracting parties, which this Court has said are entitled to considerable weight, and you also have an expert consensus among scholars and so on. So affirming the court below would take us out of step with the rest of the world.  70 other countries are parties to this treaty -- to this treaty, and it could believe an irritant if they think that we're not living up to our obligations. It also would make service more difficult for U.S. plaintiffs who are looking to serve defendants who are abroad.  It would take away from them the ability to use the mails in situations where they might be trying to serve someone in a country where the central authority is slow or expensive.  And so for all those reasons, we think that the Court should reverse the judgment below. If the Court has no further questions.   ",16-254X
0,"Elena Kagan  Do you think it's a problem for your position that no other court in the world has construed the treaty this way?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, this goes back to Justice Alito's question.  I mean, is that -- is that your answer to it, that it's just they're all construing this because he -- they use a completely different interpretive stance than we do?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, one question I suppose might be whether that is in fact producing the disparity in -- in judgments.  But even suppose you're right that it is, I mean, these are treaties.  So the idea that, you know, we would be consistently interpreting a treaty differently from the entire rest of the world would seem to create problems for our treaty-making powers, for our -- our ability to conform with what our treaty partners expect.  I mean, it would be -- be sort of a problem for international relations, wouldn't it? If we're like, well, we just interpret everything that we write differently from the way everybody else in the world does.   ",16-254X
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, why is it directed there if it doesn't say that? I mean, in fact, we said the opposite in Eastex.  We said employees seeking to improve working conditions through resort to administrative and judicial forums, essentially the legislatures and the courthouses and the agencies, is covered by the mutual aid or protection clause. So, you know, in Eastex, we came up against this question, said it was very clear that the mutual aid and protection clause swept further than the workplace itself, as long as the ultimate goals were workplace-related, whether you took those goals to the -- in the -- you know, activity in the workplace or in the agencies or in the courts, it didn't matter at all, it was all covered by Section 7.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Clement --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, what about --   Elena Kagan  What about Section 102 and 103 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act? Because let's take Justice Kennedy's example.  You have three guys and they all join claims, so we don't have the question about a class action and whether that's concerted.  This is clearly concerted.  And they're seeking higher wages, so it's clearly for their mutual aid and protection.  So they're covered under Section 7. And then Section 102 of the NLGA basically just repeats Section 7.  And then Section 103 says -- and I'm quoting now -- ""Any undertaking or promise in conflict with"" -- essentially the language in Section 7 -- ""Shall not be enforceable in any court."" So what about that? Any undertaking or promise in conflict with Section 7 rights; in other words, any waiver of Section 7 rights ""Shall not be enforceable in any court?""   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The only thing it assumed was that this was covered under Section 7.  And you --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You yourself said this is concerted and it's for mutual aid and protection.  And once that's true, this language of Norris-LaGuardia comes in and says forget about a waiver because an undertaking in conflict with Section 7 shall not be enforceable.   Elena Kagan  Well, it's an agreement, but it's an agreement to waive a Section 7 right.  I mean, that's what it is. It's saying I used to have this right for concerted activity, and now I don't.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Wall, can I interrupt you because --   Elena Kagan  Justice Alito has one and then I do.   Elena Kagan  I take it that both you and Mr. Clement agree that, if you had a discriminatory arbitration agreement, let's say an arbitration agreement that said that the employer will pay the arbitration costs of men but not women, that that would not be enforceable.  Why not?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  So, if that's the case and you're saying there can be a conflict between statutes and the Title VII would supply a clear congressional command, even though Title VII says absolutely nothing about arbitration.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, here's -- here's one understanding -- may I continue?   Elena Kagan  Is one understanding of Title VII says to the employer, you shall not discriminate, and Section 7 says to the employer, you shall not interfere with concerted activity, such as three guys joining together to bring a suit if they want to.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Griffin, is this one way to think about the question? Of course, Section 7 doesn't extend to the ends of the Earth.  If there are three employees who go out jointly rioting in the streets, they run up against anti-riot laws and they go to jail just like everybody else. What Section 7 does and what Section 8 does is to establish a set of rules that deal with how employers can deal with employees. And one of the things that Section 7 and Section 8 say in concert, if you will, is that employers can't demand as conditions of employment the waivers of concerted rights. And that's all you're saying here.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you have a view, Mr. Griffin, as to whether bringing a class action is itself concerted activity by a single named plaintiff?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Clement, usually, usually when you have a right, the fact that there is one way to exercise a right left over does not make it okay if we've taken away another 25 ways of exercising the right. You know, when we think about the First Amendment, we don't say we can ban leafleting because you can always write an op ed.  And the same thing applies here. The fact that there's something left over by way of concerted activity does not make it okay under Section 7 and Section 8 to deprive employees of many other means of protected activity.   ",16-285X

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Bishop, could I step back just for a bit? I mean, I understand that your basic argument is the list is the list and what's on the list controls.   Elena Kagan  But if I said to you what was Congress's theory behind the list, do you think Congress had one?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So your basic view is, look, you should just resign yourself to thinking of this as having no particular rationale.  Congress said what it said.  Nobody can figure out what the reasons are that Congress included those things and not other things.  It's all a themeless pudding and that's just what it is?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that -- is that the idea?   Elena Kagan  In the -- in the government's brief, they ask -- they say, well, what if we had just done it the following way? We, you know, issued a rule saying don't discharge -- you can't discharge more than a certain amount of a certain pollutant in these following waters. And just list the waters in the rule that says how much of the pollutant you can't discharge.  And they say, under your rule, that would come out differently, but it shouldn't come out differently.   Elena Kagan  So let me make sure I understand.  On -- on -- on that rule, if the -- if somebody challenged that rule, where would it go?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You -- you can't discharge more than X amount of Y pollutant in the following waters.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's an effluent limitation, but you say it's not under 1311.   Elena Kagan  So then it goes to the district court?   Elena Kagan  Do you -- do you think general -- I mean, does your interpretation depend very much on a specific understanding of the word ""under""? In other words, you are reading this to say something like under the specific authority of Section 1311, 1312.  But ""under"" is a kind of nebulous word.  It doesn't say under the specific authority here.  It just says ""under."" You might read ""under"" a little bit differently.  You might read ""under"" to say something like limitations regulating actions taken under Sections 1311, 1312, et cetera. So why should we read ""under"" your way, rather than in some other way?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But how about -- I take the point, but how about promulgating a limitation, regulating actions taken under 1311, 1312? If you did it that way, it would come out the government's way.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes, but, on -- on the other hand, you yourself treat this rule as very much limiting your activities.  It is a limitation on activities.  It's combined with another limitation, to -- to say you can't discharge pollutants where you want to discharge pollutants, but it's very much part and parcel of the limitation that you're objecting to.

And suppose he's right, that in the context of this whole provision, which starts out about ""promulgating limitations,"" that ""under"" is -- is best taken to mean under the specific authority of.

Elena Kagan  And that both are limited to failures to satisfy the prerequisites to naturalization. And that's really what we should be thinking about when we interpret that.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Parker?   Elena Kagan  Please, I'm sorry.  Finish up.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  But isn't --   Elena Kagan  And you'll be glad to know I don't have another of these questions for you. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Although I am a little bit horrified to know that every time I lie about my weight, it has those kinds of consequences. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Yeah. Can I just ask you -- can I ask you to take you through a few parts of your brief?   Elena Kagan  Because I guess I felt a little bit confused on reading what your standard is.   Elena Kagan  So on page 14, you say that the question is whether Petitioner violated the law in the course of procuring naturalization, in the course of procuring naturalization.  Then on page 9 and page 17, you say that the question is whether a person procures naturalization in a manner that violates very -- that violates other laws. Which are we talking about? Is it in the course of or in a manner that violates other laws?   Elena Kagan  Yeah.  I mean, it seems sort of different to me.  ""In the course of"" is what creates the hypotheticals that Justice Breyer was talking about, about the penknife or the gun or something like that.   Elena Kagan  But what -- so what you're saying -- but we -- you -- I can just choose, you -- you can tell me, your standard is in a manner that violates other laws.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  So then -- I mean, it makes me want to say, okay, what does it mean to procure naturalization in the manner that violates other laws. And then you talk about that.  And you talk about that on -- this -- the -- this is the only time I found in the brief where you actually suggest what it means to procure naturalization in a way that -- in a manner that violates other laws.  And you say on page 18, what that means is by violating those various laws.  By violating those various laws.  And that made me think that's a causal requirement.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You procure naturalization -- this is, again, on page 18 -- a person who knowingly procures naturalization in an unlawful manner, and then you clarify that that means by violating the laws Congress has enacted.  So when you say that you procure naturalization by violating laws Congress has enacted, all you're saying is that -- is that the naturalization results from the violation of those laws.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And I guess if that's not what you meant to say -- and I don't mean to trick you here --   Elena Kagan  -- if that's not what you meant to say in this brief, although it suggests -- it -- it -- I think it is what you say, but if it's not what you meant to say, well, how could it be anything else?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, number one, where is that in the statute?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it doesn't say the statute.  It just says contrary to law.  It doesn't say what laws.  It doesn't say laws governing the naturalization process.  So that's -- that's one issue. But -- but that's a different issue from the one I'm talking about.   Elena Kagan  Whatever laws it is, whether it's all laws or whether it's laws relating to the naturalization process.   Elena Kagan  When you describe what you mean when you say in a manner that violates the laws, it's when you say, you say it's by -- you -- you procure naturalization by violating the laws, you very naturally -- I think it's a totally naturally -- natural --   Elena Kagan  -- construction of the language, you very naturally say you got the naturalization by violating those laws, meaning that the naturalization is the result of those -- that violation. Because what else could you mean when you say -- when you -- when you have a naturalization and you have these violation of laws?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Again, that the violation led to the naturalization.   Elena Kagan  I know.  I'm sort of suggesting that in trying to describe that you ended up using the Petitioner's formulation, and that seems quite natural to me because I don't know what other formulation you could use --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- to describe what it means and say in a manner that violates those laws.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's such a shorter statement of my question.  It's perfect. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Parker, let me -- let me try this another way.  If you take this phrase, which is a kind of a stilted phrase, because the ""contrary to law"" comes in between.  But -- but it -- all it really means is procure naturalization illegally. Do you agree with that?   Elena Kagan  Procure contrary to law and naturalization, it's procure naturalization --   Elena Kagan  So the idea that procuring naturalization illegally somehow includes illegal acts that have no effect on naturalization, or on procuring naturalization, it's -- it's just not how we use language. How could it be that that is true?   Elena Kagan  But it has -- but it has no effect on the decision to naturalize.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  And I guess what I'm saying is that, how do you use that phrase in a statute and not mean that there has to be a relationship between the illegal acts and the procurement of naturalization?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is -- is that the false statement for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit?   Elena Kagan  Okay.   ",16-309X
1,"Elena Kagan  I would have thought that the -- that -- that the difference is more fundamental, which is that usually in Strickland, we are asking what was going to happen at trial.   Elena Kagan  And we don't think, well, there was this 1 percent chance that the witness would drop dead.  We put that to the side.   Elena Kagan  But here, the inquiry is different.  The inquiry is not the outcome of the trial. The inquiry is the outcome of the plea proceeding.   Elena Kagan  And the plea proceeding might be very affected by somebody saying, you know, given my ties to this country, given my negative ties to any other country, given the fact that this is only a nine-month difference in prison term, I'm going to roll the dice for that 1 percent chance.   Elena Kagan  And that would be a completely reasonable thing to do, a thing that many people would do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But the key is that the outcome of the proceeding here is not the outcome of the trial, as it usually is in a Strickland case.  The outcome of the proceeding here is the outcome of the plea negotiation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that is the Hill test, right?   Elena Kagan  We've said that.   Elena Kagan  I mean, this is not your test.   Elena Kagan  This is a test that's staring at me on page 59 of volume 474.   ",16-327X
0,"Elena Kagan  You see --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- that's confusing two things.  And this goes back to the point that the Chief Justice made, is that you keep on saying what's the probability that the jury wouldn't have convicted him, but that's not the question, and we made this clear in Hill and in other cases. The question is: What's the -- what's the -- what's the probability that the relevant proceeding would have been different? And here the relevant proceeding is the plea negotiation and the plea agreement.  And that's the thing that we're looking at is did this deficient performance lead to a different decision by this -- by Mr. Lee to go to trial or not, to plea or not.  And that's all we're supposed to be looking at here, according to Hill. Now, that has its difficulties, as Justice Alito said.  What exactly do we look to? How do we draw lines? There's no question that this is, in some cases, an uncomfortable inquiry.  But that's the inquiry we're supposed to be making, isn't it? And you keep flipping it to a different inquiry, which is the inquiry in a trial context, but not in a plea context.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  This is what -- this is what Hill says, Mr. Feigin.  It just says, here's the standard: The defendant must show that there's a reasonable probability that but for counsel's errors, he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. That's what we're trying to determine, whether he would have insisted on going to trial.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So to the contrary, when Hill keeps on going, it says, you know, this -- this defendant didn't care about his parole eligibility, so we shouldn't -- we shouldn't look at the fact that the -- the parole eligibility was a bad deal for him because he didn't care. So the emphasis clearly in Hill is -- is what are the things that would have made a difference --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- in the plea negotiation?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What Padilla is saying, isn't it, Mr. Feigin, is essentially, look, this is not going to be a case where somebody can just get up and say this is what I would have done and the court has to accept it. No, Padilla says.  The court doesn't have to accept every claim that a defendant makes.  A court can test those claims against a notion of rationality, against a notion of what reasonable people would do. But still, the -- the essence of the inquiry is what would -- what would have happened at the plea negotiation, not what would have happened at the trial.   Elena Kagan  You don't mean that --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- Mr. Feigin.  I think --   Elena Kagan  You don't mean that.  I think -- because I think what you just said was that there's no constitutional right to go to trial when there's no evidence?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Of course --   Elena Kagan  -- there's a constitutional right to go to trial, isn't there?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Even if there's -- even if there's very weak evidence on your side.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well --   Elena Kagan  Well, let me just --   Elena Kagan  -- finish the question. I mean, you would agree that there's a constitutional right to go to trial, regardless of what the --   Elena Kagan  -- regardless of what the state of the evidence was; right?   Elena Kagan  Which is the question that Justice Sotomayor asked you.  And she said, and why isn't this correct? So then the question is, has there been deficient performance? And a person's entitlement to go to trial and entitlement to stare at all the various probabilities and to make an informed choice, that entitlement has been taken away by the supremely deficient performance.  And that should be the question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Strickland is a very different case in that -- in that way.  Because what Strickland says is once you're at a trial, you're right is to a fair and accurate trial.  And nullification has nothing to do with a fair and accurate trial. But this is before.  This is when you're trying to decide whether to exercise that right to go to trial.  And there, what you're entitled to is that a lawyer be able to give you, in a nondeficient way, the various circumstances, the various things that you would consider to enable you to make that constitutional -- constitutionally protected decision in a reasonable way.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, all you're asking the judge to do is to say that in certain circumstances, it is not beyond the bounds of reasonableness to throw the dice in order to get an outcome -- in order to get -- in order not to be deported from a country where you've lived your whole life.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Feigin, again the -- just in your words, objective reasonableness, why can't a judge find as to a defendant that it is objectively reasonable to give up six or eight or nine months for a shot at staying in this country rather than being deported to a place that you don't know and where you have no ties? I mean, you know, if somebody gave me that choice, sign me up. So I think of myself as an objectively reasonable human being.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's an objectively reasonable assessment, it's an -- it -- it would be an objectively reasonable choice to exercise my right to a jury trial in that context.  And that's the question, whether it's objectively reasonable to make a decision different from the decision that I would have made in this proceeding, which is the plea negotiation.   Elena Kagan  Well, the court can do it in the way that the Court has done it since 1985 when we said that this was the inquiry under Hill.  This is what courts have been doing since -- for the last 30 years.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's what many courts have been doing for three decades.   INTERRUPTING ",16-327X

Elena Kagan  But how do we really know? Are -- are you saying that a court can never announce a generally applicable rule first in an arbitration case?

Could you just -- you know, just from a commonsense basis, it seems hard to understand why Congress would want all these unenforceable proofs of claim to flow in, because only two things can happen.  One is that the trustee will properly filter out those claims; and the other is that the trustee will be swamped and won't have the time or the energy or the inclination or he'll make mistakes, and some of those claims will be deemed enforceable when, in fact, they're not. So why would anybody want these proofs of claim to flood into the bankruptcy system?   Elena Kagan  But I -- but I -- the understanding here is that this case involves not claims which maybe they're barred by the statute of limitations and maybe they're not, but the issue, as presented to us, is as to claims where everybody knows, including the person who's filing the proof of claim, that they're barred by the statute of limitations. And what sense could it make for Congress to think, oh, that's a great idea for some -- for people just to file those claims and -- and, you know, the -- on the -- on -- the best thing that can happen is that those claims will be filtered out, and the worst thing that can happen is that they won't be.  People will make mistakes and people will pay on things that they shouldn't be paying on.   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. -- I'm sorry.   Elena Kagan  Let's suppose that you are right, that the Code allows this.  I mean, it's hard for me to believe that the Code actively invites it, but let's suppose, as it's written, allows that.  So then you wouldn't violate the Code by filing these proofs of claim.  That's -- that's for sure.  But why would that also absolve you from liability under other statutes? The codes does not obligate this.  You don't have to do this under the Code.  It's a choice.  And then another statute can come along and say, you know what, for certain actors, for certain creditors, for these debt collectors, there's an independent rule and the Code says nothing about that.   Elena Kagan  Is your argument --   Sarah E. Harrington  -- 100 percent of the time.   Elena Kagan  -- dependent on a view of the code that precludes these kinds of claims?   Sarah E. Harrington  Yes.  Yes.   Elena Kagan  So if -- if one looked at the code and said, well, it seems as though these kinds of claims, although unenforceable, can be filed, if that was your view of the code, what do you think follows from that?   Sarah E. Harrington  So then I think it would not be unfair and it would not misleading, and if I'd like -- if I could, I'd like to tell you why.  It's -- the reason it's unfair here is because the creditor does not have a right to get paid in bankruptcy on this type of claim and so it's unfair to try to do that and to put the other participants to the burden of making sure that it doesn't happen. It's misleading because when you file a proof of claim under Rule 9011 you're making an implicit representation -- may I finish my sentence? That you have done a reasonable investigation and have a good faith basis for believing that the claim is warranted. If it is warranted under the Bankruptcy Code then that's not misleading.

Do some of them only arise in a bankruptcy proceeding?   ",16-348X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Russell, do you have a few examples -- I -- I suspect you've thought of this -- just of sentences which use the word ""owed"" to -- to mean what you want it to mean in this case, without any other context clues?   Elena Kagan  Right.  But you wouldn't think that, right? I mean, I'm just wondering whether -- and I -- I understand that you have your superfluidity argument, which is, in your view, a kind of context clue.  But if you just look at the language, is -- can you come up with any sentence which -- which points toward your reading rather than towards Mr. Shanmugam's?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, usually, when we think about ambiguous phrases, you know, we can say, well, you could say this sentence and then it would mean X.  Or you could say this sentence and then it would mean Y. But my problem when I think about this word is that I can never get it to mean what you want it to mean, no matter --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- how I construct a sentence.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Shanmugam, it doesn't make much sense, though, does it? I mean, take this very case.  So your clients serviced this debt and counted as a debt collector at that time.  And then your client purchased the debt and all of a sudden is not a debt collector.  And I guess the question is: What happened in between the time when your client serviced the debt and the time when your client purchased the debt that in any way changed its relationship with the borrower such that Congress wouldn't be concerned any longer with its behavior?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Let's assume that for the -- for the purposes of the question.   INTERRUPTING ",16-349X
1,"Elena Kagan  Can I --   Elena Kagan  Can I ask about the first theory, because you said if there was a violation -- excuse me -- of the knock-and-announce rule, and a death or an injury proximately caused by that violation, then there could be recovery. Is that what you said?   Elena Kagan  Yes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course.   Elena Kagan  And this is qualified immunity context; everything has to be a violation of clearly established law, quite right. So I guess the question is, why is this case any different? In other words, this case you don't have the knock-and-announce violation; you have a different constitutional violation, which is an unauthorized entry.  And why would it not be the case that the -- that the death or injury in such a case is also proximately caused by that violation? In other words, proximate cause says what kind of things are foreseeable, and it says -- it sets an outer bound, and it says totally flukey, random things we're not going to say are proximately caused. But it doesn't seem to me a flukey or random thing to say when there is an authorized entry into somebody's home, violence may well result.  And so the proximate cause analysis seems to flow in much the same way, maybe not to quite the same -- like with -- quite the same obviousness, but in much the same way as in your knock-and-announce example.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's -- it's a simple question, Mr. Rosenkranz.   Elena Kagan  You said something about knock and announce.  I say why isn't the same theory applicable when the constitutional violation is unauthorized entry into somebody's home?   Elena Kagan  That is an unauthorized entry into somebody's home.   Elena Kagan  So that is the clearly established constitutional violation.   Elena Kagan  Why isn't the proximate cause -- why it -- why wouldn't it be that a death or injury that results when somebody barges into, goes into somebody's home without legal authorization, that one of the things that foreseeably can result from that is a shooting?   Elena Kagan  But it might very well change --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It might very well change the outcome.  When somebody shows up with a warrant, they show it -- they show the warrant, they have legal authority, people act very differently than when somebody shows up with no warrant and says, I don't have authority.  I'm coming in anyway.  That's a very different set of circumstances that a homeowner has to respond to. And what is for -- what foreseeably happens where there is a warrant is not the same thing.  When somebody -- when a police officer has legal authority, tells the homeowner he has legal authority, the set of results that happens is just not the same as when a police officer just says, ""I'm here, I don't have any legal authority, I'm coming in anyway"".   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, it's -- it's possible. I mean, I take the point, Mr. Rosenkranz, it's possible that you have a warrant in your pocket and you don't say anything about it, although that would seem like very silly -- stupid police work.  But the prototypical case when somebody has a warrant is that they tell a homeowner they have a warrant and that they have a right to be on the premises.  That's what usually happens. And similarly, what often happens is that when somebody doesn't say that to a homeowner, they are making it far more likely that violence will ensue.  And certainly the kind of violence that could ensue is not the kind of flukey, random stuff that is filtered out by a proximate cause inquiry.   Elena Kagan  Do you --   Nicole A. Saharsky  -- with the Ninth's --   Elena Kagan  -- before -- can I just -- do you agree in general, before you address the question in particular, do you agree in general what that framing -- that if there is an independent constitutional violation and if it does proximately cause the injury, then there's a 1983 action?   Nicole A. Saharsky  In general, yes.  I mean, 1983 imposes liability and damages for clearly established constitutional violations, and although this Court has had very few opportunities to address causation in the Section 1983 context, it has said as a general matter it would start with tort law principles, and I think those would include proximate causation and superseding-cause principles. But we have a problem in this case in what the Ninth Circuit found was the proximate cause of the injuries in this case was the failure to knock and announce.  But the fail -- failure to knock and announce was not a violation of clearly established law.  The officers have qualified immunity for that.   Elena Kagan  So that seems fair enough. But then the question might become, whether here or on remand, whether an unauthorized entry, where there was a clearly established violation, whether one could say that that was the proximate cause of the shooting.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Yes.  And I think there's two answers to that question, one about this case and second, more generally. About this case, the analysis by the Ninth Circuit was that it was the knock-and-announce and not the warrant, and if I could just illustrate this.  In this case, you had officers that did not have a warrant and did not knock and announce.  But imagine that they did have a warrant and still didn't knock and announce. What the Ninth Circuit said was the problem was the startling entry.  So with or without the warrant, you would have had this problem from the knock-and-announce, but as we discussed, the knock-and-announce is immunized. As a general matter, I think the point that Petitioners were making at argument and in their -- in the brief is well taken, that the scope of the risks for a warrant violation as opposed to the scope of the risk for a knock and a -- knock-and-announce violation are very different.   Elena Kagan  But one of -- a warrant violation is just -- it's -- it's just saying unauthorized entry.  And the question is whether it's within the normal scope of the risk, but an unauthorized entry produces violence, not that it always or probably produces violence, but that it might produce violence in the way we kind of ask when we do proximate cause analysis.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Right.  And I don't think that we would say that an unauthorized entry itself normally produces violence when you're talking about --   Elena Kagan  Doesn't have to, normally. It doesn't have to --   Nicole A. Saharsky  Proximate cause --   Elena Kagan  Or -- you know, proximate cause is just we filter out the really fluky stuff.   Nicole A. Saharsky  Well, I -- we understand proximate cause in the scope of the risks as being what are the natural and probable consequences of your actions, what are the risks that make the conduct tortious, what bad things do you think are going to occur if you do this. And in the warrant context, we're talking about police showing up at the door.  And, no, we don't think that it is generally a reasonable reaction when police show up at the door with or without a warrant that you'd react violently.  And that's what Grubbs said is that when the police come to your door, you submit at that time, and that you can challenge the warrant in court later. Could I have one more sentence?   ",16-369X
0,"Elena Kagan  I guess I'm not understanding, Mr. Feldman, why you're quite making this distinction.  I mean, it -- it -- why isn't it just, look, the entry without authority, the entry without a warrant, that's a clear but-for cause of the shooting? The shooting wouldn't have happened if there hadn't been the entry; right?   Elena Kagan  Now the question is, is it a but -- is it a proximate cause of the inquiry? And it -- and it seems to me that you have to make a case -- and tell me if you agree or don't agree: You have to make a case that unauthorized entry, that one of the -- one of the things that foreseeably can happen with an unauthorized entry is that the person whose home it is will react with violence.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Can I say this --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, can I suggest why it might matter? I mean, there are two kinds of entry: One is -- let's -- for these purposes, one is an authorized entry and one is an unauthorized entry. Now the question is, what kind of conduct does each of those kinds of entries provoke? If you're an authorized entry, you don't really think that it's going to provoke violence.  But if you're an unauthorized entry, you do think it's going to provoke violence.  So the --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- proximate cause -- the -- the proximate results of each of those two different kinds of entry are very different.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Feldman, you said there are two kinds of entrance; right? One is a trespasser entrant, and one is a nontrespasser entrant.   Elena Kagan  A guest entrant, let's call the person; right?   Elena Kagan  And when a trespasser enters your home, different sets of things foreseeably happen --   Elena Kagan  -- than when a guest enters your home.   Elena Kagan  So it's not just an entry. The question is, who's entering: a trespasser or a guest?   ",16-369X

0,"Elena Kagan  The two-tiered structure can be where the second tier just cuts off the discovery rule.  So that would perfectly well explain the two-tiered structure just as that, and say, yeah, usually it's one year after discovery, but if you discover it five years later, that's too much.  So it just cuts off the discovery rule.  And that's the only thing that the two-tiered structure means perhaps.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I suppose one question is, what exactly do -- have we meant when we say a statute of repose? And we've certainly meant something different from a statute of limitations.  But I think what we were talking about in Lampf was the cutoff of the discovery rule.  It -- it sort of didn't matter whether your claim was going to accrue in the normal way, consistent with the statute of limitations.  At some point, we were going to cut it off. And that's what we meant when we said statute of repose, as opposed to some term that cut off a variety of claims that just weren't before us and that we weren't thinking about.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you're suggesting we -- there's only one view of the word ""action,"" and -- and the case stops there.  And perhaps that's right, but let's say it's not right.  Let's just suppose that ""action"" is a word that sometimes it's used one way, and sometimes it's used another way, and we should look a little bit as to the practical consequences of what you're doing. And it seems as though -- and tell me if you think this is wrong -- that the consequences go something like this: If we go your way in this case, any future suit like this, all large investors, the kind of investors CalPERS -- CalPERS is not going to make this mistake again.  CalPERS is going to file a protective action for itself, and then it can do what it wants.  Opt out, don't opt out, wait and see, whatever. Well, small investors are not going to do that.  They're not going to have the faintest idea that they should be doing that.  So this is a rule that's kind of guaranteed to create make-work for district courts to be essentially irrelevant for large investors, and for small investors to lose their claims.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I know you think that --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But just to --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It puts tremendous pressure on the opt-out right, right? We're used to thinking that the opt-out right is a very important part of class actions; it's what saves them from a due process problem, that people actually do get to say, I don't want any part of this. And you're saying they only get to say that within 3 years, which may be not within 3 years of the time the suit was brought; it may be 6 months of the time the suit was brought, or 1 month or something like that.  And, you know, if -- if you haven't decided within that month or 6 months that these lawyers are not doing a good job, you've lost your ability forever to do it for yourself.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  All power to you, but, you know, a lot of those settlement hearings are awfully tough.   Elena Kagan  But Rule 23 did not want that to happen.  Rule 23 wanted to allow people to opt out rather than to be confined in the suit for the entire pendency of the suit and then to start fighting the outcome at the -- at the last moment.

0,"Elena Kagan  Well, that's what --   Elena Kagan  That's what the -- the Board says, but we don't know that, right? Isn't it for the district court to make exactly that determination?   Elena Kagan  He still -- he still thinks he has civil service claims, in addition to discrimination claims.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's because the Board didn't -- said that it was not reviewing the merits of his civil service claims.  But he still thinks he has civil service claims and discrimination claims, and so he is rejecting the idea that the Board -- the Board has said it's not a mixed case, but he think it's still a mixed case. And the question is, who decides that? Because if it is a mixed case -- yes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's going to go back to the -- to the district court, eventually.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So I don't see that, Mr. Fletcher, as addressed by this statutory language that you talk about.  You know, you talk about 7702, and as Justice Alito said, you said (a) says, ""has been affected,"" and (b) says -- alleges that a basis for the action was discrimination.  But all 7702 does, is it defines a category of cases, these mixed cases, and that's what defines them, that it -- that the employee has been affected by a certain kind of action and makes a certain kind of allegation and it says, well, the Board decides that.  And then 7703 says that, afterwards, it goes to the district court. But what is left completely unaddressed in this is the question of who decides whether this is a mixed case as defined by 7702.  7702 doesn't tell you that.  It's a -- it's a -- so -- so where in the statute do you think it tells you who decides whether something is a mixed case as defined by 7702?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm just asking you -- you know, you point to this language.  This language doesn't get you there.  I'm just asking whether you have other language to point to that suggests that the ""who decides"" question ought to be in the Federal Circuit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, it obviously --   Elena Kagan  No, it obviously makes a distinction between allegations and -- and being affected by an action, but only -- all that this provision does is it defines what a mixed case is, and says the -- the Merit System Protection Board will decide that mixed case. And the definition of a mixed case has one element, which is an actual thing, and another element, which is an allegation.   Elena Kagan  But this is only the statement that the Board will address mixed cases. It doesn't say anything about what happens if there's a dispute as to whether there is a mixed case, who gets to decide that question.   Elena Kagan  But that's --   Elena Kagan  But the whole point of this scheme, generally -- and we have said this, and it appears on the face of the statute -- is to make sure that the employee doesn't have to claim-split. And so we've said when the Board dismisses your claim on the merits, you can take it to the district court.  And we have said that when it dismisses your case on procedure, you can take it to the district court.  You can do everything in the district court, you don't have to split it up, do one thing in the Federal Circuit and one thing in the district court. And now, for this one category of thing, which you call ""jurisdictional,"" Mr. Landau says in this case it looks an awful lot like a merits determination, but anyway, for this one category of thing, we're going to treat it differently, we're going to insist that you split your claims and -- and not bring the discrimination claim in the Federal Circuit because you can't bring it there, but instead you have to go to the Federal Circuit on your CSRA claim.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, the claim -- it's temporary claims-splitting.  It's -- you know, you have to put your -- your discrimination claim on the back burner and proceed with respect only to your civil service claim and decide, you know, whether the -- the board can -- can review that or not.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  That's a kind of claim-splitting.  I mean, you can say eventually it will all get into the same place, but eventually can be can be a long time.  And as I said before, your discrimination claim may have lapsed by then, and you don't guarantee that it will survive.  And so that seems to me something which is -- is -- you know, really cuts against the way this scheme works in the vast majority of cases, and the way we have said it should.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Then why --   Elena Kagan  Well, Kloeckner certainly says it, but beyond Kloeckner, I mean, merits cases that -- that have been -- have been going to district court for years prior to Kloeckner; isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  Right.  This would be a kind of revolution, I mean, in -- in -- to the extent that you can have a revolution in this kind of case. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  So but --   Elena Kagan  -- the question, Mr. Fletcher, is a contested one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you think he has to ask that? Suppose he asked something else.  Suppose he said, I'd like the district court just to decide this. Could he do that?

You know, in Jones, there were a couple of different opinions, but five justices, as -- as I count it, said this -- this is from Justice Alito's opinion: ""Society's expectation has been that law enforcement and others would not, and indeed in the main simply cannot, monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual's"" -- there it was a car -- ""for a long period."" So how is it different from that?   Elena Kagan  So the question is why that should make more of a difference than the obvious similarity between this case and Jones? And the obvious similarity is that, in both cases, you have reliance on a new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking. Now, you're exactly right, there were different means, but in both cases, you have a new technology that allows for 24/7 tracking and a conclusion by a number of justices in Jones that that was an altogether new and different thing that did intrude on people's expectations of who would be watching them when.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Dreeben, can I --   Elena Kagan  Right.  But, Mr. Dreeben, that could go away tomorrow.  The question here is the constitutional question, not the statutory one.  So can I take you back to what, it seems to me, is the essential identity between the factual circumstances here and in Jones, which is that the government is getting 24/7 information. I mean, in some ways, you could say this is more.  Jones was just about a car; this is about every place that you are, whether you're in a car or not.  And you said to me that what makes it different is that you've given the information to another person.  But I recall that when you were here in the Jones case, your theory for why that was permissible was essentially that you had given that information to the entire public; in other words, just by being in the world, everybody sees you, everybody watches you, and you've lost your expectation of privacy in that way. Now, we pretty conclusively rejected that argument.  Why is it different when it's giving it to one person, the same information, this 24/7 tracking, than we said it was when you give it to the entire world?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But let's assume you could.  Let's assume Mr. Wessler is right that the -- the technology keeps on getting better and better, more and more precise, it's not 10 football fields anymore; it's half of this courtroom.  Next month, it may be an eighth of this courtroom. You know, so let's assume that we're looking ahead just a little bit and it's pretty precision-targeting.

It doesn't matter whether there's really a lack of voluntariness on the individual's part in terms of conveying that information to the third-party. And we could go on and we could give, you know, other factors that you might think in a sensible world would matter to this question.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Feigin, can I go to your basic 11, Rule 11 argument? Because what Rule 11 does, if you just look at the text of Rule 11, it says here are the conditions in which you can enter a conditional guilty plea, you know, you have to get some consents, and then you can enter a conditional guilty plea. It doesn't say what happens if you don't do that.  There's nothing in Rule 11 that says and the consequence of not entering a conditional guilty plea is X, Y, Z. So you have to look outside the rule for the consequence of not entering a conditional guilty plea.  And it seems to me that the place you look, the question you ask is, well, what's the inherent effect of that guilty plea? So Rule 11 just tells you, you know, go try to figure out what the inherent effect of the guilty plea is, and what's covered by it, and, on the other hand, what's not. So I don't see how Rule 11 really is the answer to this question.  Rule 11 just sets up the problem.   Elena Kagan  Can I -- can I -- can I ask, Mr. Feigin, how the rule that you are espousing fits with the language that we've used in Blackledge and Menna and Broce? Because when I look at those cases, the language that we use seems totally consistent with the theory that Justice Gorsuch and Justice Breyer raised, and not consistent with yours. So when they were talking about what -- what -- what's not precluded by a guilty plea, they say, well, where you have a right not to be hailed into court at all, they say where the charge is one that the state cannot constitutionally prosecute; that last one is from Menna, and they say where the court had no power to enter the conviction; that last one is from Broce. So, in all three of those cases, the language used is where, you know, in the end you find that the -- that you've -- you've -- you've done the facts, you've satisfied the elements, but still the state can't prosecute you constitutionally or properly.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, Ms. AliKhan, I want you to assume something with me, but then I want to give you an opportunity to do something, all right? So I want you to assume with me that if the words ""and for a period of 30 days"" were not in the statute, that we wouldn't be here, that we would read this as a normal stop-clock tolling period, and -- and that the question that arises from the statute and the reason we are all here comes from the addition of these words ""and for a period of 30 days."" And I just want you to tell me why you think the addition of those words should make us read the statutes differently.   Elena Kagan  But this is 53911(d) statute, which does exactly that, used the word suspended except other than tolled.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it -- it -- it basically does exactly that.  It stops the clock and then adds some time.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, I don't think that that's right because they say tolled all the time --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- to say stop the clock.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What I'm saying is that the concept of this is used, I mean, it's not used commonly, but it has been used in at least one other statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  As kind of stop-clock plus.   Elena Kagan  But there's a very easy way to write a statute like the one that you think this one is.  I mean, Congress has done it.  All the states have done it.  I'll just read you one of Congress's: ""In the event that any action is timely brought and is thereafter dismissed, the action may be recommenced within one year."" I mean, that's a very simple way of writing a grace period statute.  Thirty states have done the exact same thing.  Nobody writes a grace period statute like this.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess I'm -- I'm not sure I understand that answer.  I mean -- I mean, here, I'm not going to speak in the language of a statute, but essentially Congress would just be saying when the pendant claim is dismissed, the person has 30 days to refile in state court.  That's a pretty easy way to state that thing.   Elena Kagan  No, but they wanted a stop-clock plus 30 days.  And that makes some sense.  I mean, it's not the only thing that makes sense.  But Congress might have thought we want a stop-clock statute for all the reasons that we often have stop-clock statutes, and then we want to give people 30 days just to make sure that the person who's filing on the last day has a little bit of time. Now, you know, is that the only thing Congress could have done? No.  But, you know, it makes perfect sense.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, here, how about this? How about -- Ms. AliKhan, I mean, maybe one thing that -- that Justice Breyer should read is Jinks, where the Court already upheld Congress's authority to pass 1367(d) under the necessary and proper clause.  And in doing so, it relied on an earlier decision of this Court, which upheld a federal provision that tolled state statutes of limitations by means of stop-clock suspension. So, that would seem to sort of put the kibosh on this argument, wouldn't it?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, but it was used --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- I mean, it was -- but Jinks was -- was talking about this very statute and relied on Kahn to make the point that federal provisions that toll state statutes of limitations are perfectly constitutional under the necessary and proper clause, didn't it?   Elena Kagan  Yes, point taken, point taken, but it upheld -- but it -- but it cited and relied on a case where exactly this kind of suspension was at issue. And you can say yes that was in a different context, but Jinks was using it for this context.   ",16-460X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Katyal, could we go back to a form of Justice Kennedy's first question, which is, just could you explain what defendant's interests are at stake here? In other words, you know, usually we've looked to fairness for the defendant when we make the due process inquiry.  So what is the unfairness here, given that there is another suit that's going to be going forward in California, and what Mr. Goldstein wants is just for additional claims of the exact same kind to be joined to that suit?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So could we just start with the fairness?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You've timed it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But it seems you're conflating two things, Mr. Katyal.  I mean, individual -- a lot of individual California claims can be joined, and then we can have an argument about what should probably be joined and what can go off individually.  But -- but that's a different question than the question in this case, which is, why is it unfair to glom on Texas claims and New York claims to the California claims, once we already have a mass action which will have multiple injury trials?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But you already know because this is a nationwide marketing that you do, nationwide drug, you already know that you're subject to jurisdiction in any of the 50 States and have to be prepared to confront jurisdiction in any of the 50 States.   Elena Kagan  Well, I guess what I'm saying is that I -- the unfairness aspect of this is what I really want to drive at, because predictability just honestly doesn't seem like what's at issue here given that you know it's perfectly predictable to have litigation in any of the 50 States. So the question is, why is it unfair to have more litigation than you would in one of those States rather than another?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Could you make this as concrete as you can for me? And I -- I'm assuming that your interests are the flip side to the plaintiffs' interests.  So why is it that a person would choose to sue in California, and why is it that Bristol-Squibb does not want more suits than necessary to happen in California?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess -- I guess I'm -- I'm feeling a little bit stymied here because I thought you were going to come at me with saying, look, the juries in California are different or there's punitive damages in California when there's not someplace else or the substantive rules might be different.  And I'm not hearing any of that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So who -- which State are we worried about here? Are we worried about the plaintiff's State, or are we worried about the defendant's State?   Rachel P. Kovner  I think there are two States that have a very strong interest, at least two States that have a very strong interest in providing a forum for the conduct at issue here.  It's States where the plaintiffs were injured, and States where the defendants are at home, because States have an interest in regulating the conduct of their --   Elena Kagan  So on the plaintiff's side, that seems a pretty attenuated interest, if -- because usually when we say that the State has an interest, it's in protecting their own citizens and providing their own citizens with a forum.  But here the citizen has decided he doesn't want that protection, he wants to go someplace else.  It seems, you know, a little bit weak to say that the State has a very strong interest in protecting its own citizen that doesn't want to be there.   Rachel P. Kovner  I don't think so at all.  I think, Your Honor, that the State has a strong interest in regulating the conduct that occurs within its borders, and defining what's fair with respect to how that conduct is adjudicated.  That's --   ",16-466X
0,"Elena Kagan  But not necessarily to all the plaintiffs here.   Elena Kagan  Well, how about the interest of the State that Bristol-Myers resides in? In other words, they might have an interest in not having their citizens hailed into court against their will in another part of the country.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's like saying, Mr. Goldstein, that the claim relates to another claim that relates to contacts with the forum.  I mean, I guess I'm -- I'm missing what the relationship is between an Ohio plaintiff's claim and the defendant's contacts with the forum that doesn't go through another claim.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, I understand that that's your point.  But I guess what I've always thought that our personal jurisdiction cases require is somebody to state in -- state something like this: The plaintiff's claim relates to or arises out of the defendant's contacts with the forum State.  So here, Bristol-Myers' contacts with California.  And I just want you to tell me how an Ohio plaintiff's claim arises out of or relates to the defendant's contacts with California. Just it -- it does because why?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Let me see if I understand that, because you're saying -- usually we say how does the claim relate to the contacts in a particular State, say in California.  Here we can't answer that question, really.  So we say now the contacts in California are nationwide contacts, and the plaintiff's claim relates to those nationwide contacts.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Those nationwide contacts being a nationwide advertising campaign, a nationwide marketing campaign, and so forth.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Goldstein, it seems to me, on your theory, it could be zero California plaintiffs, because here's what you told me.  You told me that the reason that this -- that an Ohio citizen's claim arises out of the contacts in California is because the contacts in California are really nationwide contacts.  And if that's so, it's met regardless of whether there are any California plaintiffs are not.   Elena Kagan  So if that's your theory, it doesn't matter whether there are 86 or 20 or zero, because the contacts arise out of the nationwide/California contacts.   Elena Kagan  The claim arises out of that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah.  I don't think that's right, Mr. Goldstein.  Our arising out of relating to test, has always been about the first part of the inquiry, and then all of the four factors is a backstop to that.  It's an additional test after we decide whether your claim arises out of the forum contacts.   Elena Kagan  Can I take you back?   Elena Kagan  Can I take you back to Justice Breyer's question about Federal courts --   Elena Kagan  -- and multidistrict litigation? Because you didn't say something that makes me think, if you didn't say it, I don't understand. Assuming that there was subject matter jurisdiction, that there's diversity, it still it seems to me that the way -- there's no nationwide service of process here. So the Federal courts have to mimic the State courts; isn't that correct?   ",16-466X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, what does that mean? What would you be looking for, when you say that the federal government took responsibility? I mean, suppose that the federal government had just said we don't want states to regulate.  We don't want to regulate ourselves; we just want -- I think this is what Justice Breyer's question was -- a free market. So is that enough responsibility that the federal government has taken?   Elena Kagan  I guess what I'm asking, Mr. Olson, is you're suggesting that the federal government, in order to preempt state activity, has to itself enact some kind of comprehensive regulatory scheme; and the question is, you know, how -- what would we be looking for if that -- if that were our test? When do we know that they've enacted a sufficiently comprehensive regulatory scheme in order to allow preemption of state rules?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Olson --   Elena Kagan  So suppose I read these cases as setting up a principle that the federal government can't conscript state officials for its own purposes, you know, the federal government can -- does whatever it wants, consistent with the Commerce Clause, but it can't conscript state officials in order to do -- help them -- help the federal government do it. If that's the way I see these cases, what's being -- who is being conscripted in order to do what here?   Elena Kagan  Yeah, so --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, just the way you say that, Mr. Olson -- the federal government is saying to the states you can't do something -- so that sounds to me the language of preemption.  All the time the federal government takes some kind of action, passes a law, and then says to the states: you know what, we've got this; you can't do anything.   Elena Kagan  So do you see no difference between the federal government saying to a state, look, you can't take some preferred policy option that you would like to take, and, on the other hand, the federal government saying to a state, you must help us do something? Because I thought that our cases were all about the second thing.  You must help us. You must be our little assistants when we promote or try to advance a policy objective. And I -- I guess what I'm asking you for is how is New Jersey being put in that position with respect to this statute?   INTERRUPTING ",16-476X

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, what -- what's the line you would draw as between preemption and commandeering?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So what's the difference between saying you must pass a certain piece of legislation and saying you must maintain a piece of legislation on the books?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  How is it different from that?   ",16-476X
0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Gant, when -- when you say ""directed that a case shall be dismissed,"" are you referring only to the last few words of this statute or are you referring more broadly?   Elena Kagan  Right.  ""And shall be promptly dismissed.""   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Are you suggesting that if those five words were not in the statute, that the case would come out differently?   Elena Kagan  But -- but if you had 2(b), finished, just ""shall not be filed or maintained in a Federal court,"" full stop, you're saying that would be the same statute as the one we actually have?   Elena Kagan  Yeah.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, if that's so, I mean, I thought that you were suggesting a rule that said, well, when you direct one case, that's unconstitutional, but now you've just said you're not saying that. So, again, coming back to Justice Alito's question, I mean, we know that Congress can alter the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  And we know that Congress can alter that jurisdiction and apply it to pending cases.  We've said that over and over again. So what makes -- what would make this unconstitutional if we assumed that this is a jurisdiction-stripping statute?   Elena Kagan  Well, the law is the jurisdictional law.  That's what Congress is changing.  Congress is changing jurisdiction. In so doing, Congress is changing the law.  We haven't said Congress has to change, you know, substantive law. Here Congress is changing jurisdictional law.  It's saying, you know, yesterday you had jurisdiction over a certain category of cases.  Today you don't. Now, why is that unconstitutional or when is that unconstitutional?   Elena Kagan  I don't think that's the question, Mr. Gant.  I think the question is, and this was what I started with, would you be making the same constitutional argument if the last five words were not there? And I took you to say, yes, you would be making the same constitutional argument, and in so doing, you separated yourself from your amici because I understand your amici, as Justice Gorsuch does, as saying that everything hangs on that last five words. And you're suggesting that not everything hangs on that last five words, that you would have the exact same constitutional objections if those five words weren't in the picture.  Do I have you right?   Elena Kagan  It's like bad atmospherics?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But then you do get, again, and I think that this is the underlying premise of Justice Gorsuch's question, so take out the last five words, and you were trying to explain why what then just seems a jurisdiction-stripping statute is unconstitutional, in that -- against the backdrop of very consistent precedent that we have that says that Congress can take away the jurisdiction of the federal courts and can do so in a way that affects pending cases. And -- and so why and when is that unconstitutional?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Gant, could I -- I'm sorry to drag you around like this, but the Chief Justice asked you a question and you indicated that you agreed with his understanding of when a jurisdictional statute violated the Constitution, and -- and then you were interrupted. I just want to hear a little bit more about what you think of his question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I'm interested in that question, the Chief Justice's question, because he gave you a theory; you said yes.   Elena Kagan  But what does that mean, ""yes""? Yes why?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So why -- why is it substantially similar to that situation? That makes it sound like it's because it's about a single case, but you said that that wasn't your theory.  So what is your theory?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But doesn't Congress always do that when it strips the federal courts of jurisdiction over a category of cases?   Elena Kagan  Because we have said that that applies to pending suits.  So I guess the question is: Why aren't you saying that every time we said that, we were wrong; that any time Congress changes the jurisdiction of the federal court and then applies to pending cases, that that's a separation-of-powers issue?   Elena Kagan  Well, it's certain -- I'm sorry.  Your light's on.  Fine.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I was just following up on Justice Alito's because you -- you say directing the outcome of these cases, but any time Congress jurisdiction strips, and that applies to pending cases, it does direct the outcome of those cases.  Once upon a time those cases could proceed.  Now they can't. So Congress is directing the outcome of those cases in some sense that we've consistently held to be perfectly fine.  We might have been wrong in saying that's perfectly fine, but we've said it a lot of times.   ",16-498X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, what if it were? What -- what if they -- the Congress had said the Secretary's decision to make the Bradley Property is confirmed, and David Patchak's suit shall not be maintained and shall be dismissed.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, what's the difference between --   Elena Kagan  Is there a difference between Smith wins and there's no jurisdiction over Jones's suit?   Elena Kagan  And, therefore, Smith wins?   Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand, Mr. Shah, how that helps you.  I mean, doesn't this just exclude the power of the federal courts?   Elena Kagan  I -- I see.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Got it.   Elena Kagan  Could I ask you to -- Ms. O'Connell said when you were looking at that -- if you had a piece of legislation that said in Jones v. Smith, Smith loses, that that would be unconstitutional.   Elena Kagan  And she has to say that because nine of us said it.   Elena Kagan  So then the question is why is it different --   Elena Kagan  -- if Congress instead says in Jones v. Smith, there shall be no jurisdiction, and Smith loses.  Why -- why is that different?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  In Jones v. Smith, there shall be no jurisdiction --   Elena Kagan  -- and ergo, Smith loses.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't think Smith much cares.  Why would Smith care?   Elena Kagan  I guess I'm -- I'm not quite sure what you're reserving there, Mr. Shah, so here is a hypothetical.   Elena Kagan  There's a very large corporation, commits a lot of employment discrimination.  Because it does, it has a lot of employment discrimination suits filed against it. And so the CEO of this big corporation goes to Congress and says: These suits are getting to be a real hassle, and so I'd like a piece of legislation.  And Congress says: Good enough, and it says there shall be no jurisdiction over any employment discrimination suits filed against that corporation.   Elena Kagan  All right? And -- and -- and -- and -- and -- and in so doing, it knocks out all these employment litigation -- all these employment discrimination suits that have been filed against that corporation. Is that constitutional?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So, if this had said just David Patchak's suit, different case?   INTERRUPTING ",16-498X
1,"Elena Kagan  I -- I am --   Elena Kagan  I take your point that that's not in this case.  But if it were in this case, that what you just said does raise Mr. Clement's argument that there are many better ways, perhaps, dealing with, you know, financial regulation generally, than allowing private suits to deal with those sorts of issues.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  If I could understand what you're saying, you're saying that a norm is just a standard of conduct and doesn't have anything to with the enforcement of that standard?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that the basic point?   Elena Kagan  So in what --   Elena Kagan  If I could go back to the Chief Justice's question, so in what kind of case involving a corporate defendant would another country hold us accountable if we didn't provide a remedy?   Brian H. Fletcher  I think the classic ones are the ones that this Court suggested in Kiobel, or sort of the heartland of what Congress had in mind when it enacted the statute, which was foreign officials injured in the United States. We know from the history that led up to the enactment of the statute, Marbois, in the 1787 incident involving the Dutch ambassador, that those sorts of violations could give rise to international friction and that the purpose, as this Court said, was to provide an adequate remedy, a federal forum and an adequate remedy for those individuals, to avoid the possibility of friction.   Elena Kagan  So what you're saying is that in those sorts of classic cases, why would the foreign government care that the perpetrator was a corporation rather than an individual?   Brian H. Fletcher  And, if anything, I think it cuts the other way because I think because, as we point out, tort remedies always in virtually all circumstances include the possibility of recovering from the corporate employer when a corporation commits the tort. We think actually there's the possibility of friction or at least defeating the purpose of providing an adequate remedy if you say, in this class of tort cases, you do not get that normal tort remedy.  We think, in fact, it would be very odd to say that when the whole point of the statute, at least as we understand it and as the Court has understood it, is to provide an additional forum.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Fletcher, can -- unless you're --   Brian H. Fletcher  No, please.   Elena Kagan  Just a different kind of question, which is you are here saying there shouldn't be an automatic bar against corporate liability.   Brian H. Fletcher  That's right.   Elena Kagan  But I wonder if you have any view -- and if not, just say no -- as to what the scope of corporate liability might be. In other words, some folks have said, well, in this context, corporate liability might be only available for actions that were directed at high levels of the corporation as opposed to anything that any old employee of a corporation did. And I'm wondering whether you've thought through that question.   Brian H. Fletcher  We haven't taken a view on it.  I think the most prominent advocate of that view that I'm aware of is Judge Posner's opinion for the Seventh Circuit in Flomo where he made that suggestion. The one thing I would say about that actually is that I understand his opinion to be suggesting that that more limited version of corporate liability would be appropriate in large part because he assumed that this statute applied extraterritorially, and he was concerned about holding the corporation liable for something that happened at some far-flung office and wanted to make sure that there was appropriately high level accountability before imposing liability. And, obviously, this Court's decision in Kiobel cuts back on that concern because it makes clear that the claims have to actually touch and concern the United States, and so it might alter the analysis there.

0,"Elena Kagan  But, really, but why would it have mattered? Suppose that there was a corporation that had a beef about the ambassador and sent one of its employees to go strike the ambassador and sent a judgment-proof employee to go strike the ambassador. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  Why would France have cared?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't agree. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  But --   Elena Kagan  Well, I --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Clement, I think the reason I said I don't agree before is because, when you're talking about a standard of conduct under Sosa, it's clear that you have to find this universal body of law. But that's different from enforcement mechanisms.  It's different -- you know, we have the ATS.  Other countries have different things.  Nobody requires an ATS-like provision. Nobody -- so, as to enforcement, I mean, where -- where do you get the understanding that that's a question where all countries have to agree to the same thing?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  As far as I understood your brief, you're only getting it from that Sosa Footnote 20, which really does not make that point at all.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Look, I agree that there should be some understanding -- some notions of, you know, what do other countries do and is this likely to get us into trouble with other countries or not.  I mean, that should come into play at some point when we're trying to figure out what kind of claims to accept.  And I think even Mr. Fisher agrees with that. I don't think we have to ask about, you know, is it a uniform norm that every country accepts, but, rather, we have a set of rules under our domestic system which does hold corporations accountable. And if we use that as the typical enforcement mechanism, is that going to get us into trouble with other foreign countries? Is it going to create international friction? And it seems to me that that's the level at which all these international/foreign relations concerns come into play.   Elena Kagan  Yes, I think that that's the question.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, see, that would suggest that all enforcement mechanisms have to be the same worldwide.  And they just don't.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you think that joint and several liability -- I mean, that's also an American concept, would that have to be accepted by every country in the world?   Elena Kagan  But --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But let's talk about a -- but let's talk about a crime like that, Mr. Clement.  You know, there's a lot in this lawsuit, which I think you have plenty of things to gripe about in this lawsuit. I guess the question is, do you have something to gripe about as to this particular point, which is corporate versus individual liability? And so just -- just assume a different lawsuit. So there is an American corporation. So the defendant is an American corporation, and it uses slave labor, and it uses slave labor of people in the United States, all the work is done in the United States, the activity is in the United States, of a particular nationality.  And -- and the country from which these people come thinks that this is a pretty awful thing. And -- and you're saying that there shouldn't be ATS liability against the corporation in that circumstance even though they are using slave labor, clearly violating an international norm, even though in our domestic system, the manner of -- the method of enforcement we usually use is corporate liability, and even though this is a case in which the other country thinks who cares if it's a corporation.  We want our people to be able to recover.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  They happen not to have very much money.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It is the question.   Elena Kagan  Well, the individuals also care if it's a felony.  They would like a little bit of compensation.   Elena Kagan  I guess one of the things that I'm suggesting, Mr. Clement, and this is reflected in your brief, you spend a lot of time essentially saying that this is one of those foreign cubed cases that we dealt with in Kiobel. And that might be right.  But the question of corporate versus individual liability is a question that's entirely orthogonal to that, I mean, that you can come up with a very, very domestic-looking suit that raises the question of corporate versus individual liability and that that suit, when you focus on it, leads you to say, why on earth would you draw a distinction of this kind?

And what you are saying that Ake held was that it was a defense expert.  But -- and there are certainly parts of the opinion that read like that.

And I just want to sort of focus on the money sentence in Ake, you know, what -- the ""we therefore hold"" sentence.  And it says -- here's what we hold.  ""We hold that when the defendant makes this preliminary showing that mental health is going to be at issue, the State must assure the defendant access to a competent psychiatrist who will assist in evaluation, preparation and presentation of the defense."" So assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.  And, you know, recognizing that we're all smart people, and we can read any words, we can have an argument that any words mean anything we say, still, ""assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense,"" doesn't that mean, like, you know, that's what you -- that's the phrase you would use for a counsel, to assist in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.  It means somebody on the defendant's side.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, they're capable in the sense that sometimes they might, but it's not what you would -- this is -- I -- I guess I'm repeating myself, but this is the language that you use when you're talking about, not somebody who sometimes might, and is capable of, but who, in fact, will do so, to the best of his ability, assist the defendant.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But sometimes the Court goes beyond what the facts are, and sometimes -- you know, sometimes it issues a holding that's just precisely calibrated to the facts, and sometimes broader.  And -- and it seems that what we do is we look at the language, we look at what the Court said, and said given what the Court said, is this right clearly established. And I guess, again, just to repeat what Justice Ginsburg said, I started counting up the word ""assist"" in this opinion and, frankly, I lost track. That every time this opinion talks about this, it talks about assisting the defense and assisting the defendant, including to cross-examine the prosecution.  It just seems that the premise of the entire opinion is you're on the defense team.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, at first it does, you're exactly right.  And this is why I asked about Baldi.  I find those two paragraphs incredibly confusing, because the first paragraph says, we're distinguishing it because there it was a neutral expert. And then the second paragraph says, anyhow, Baldi -- I mean, it does -- it doesn't use the term overall, but a lower court would be crazed if it relied on Baldi after that opinion.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  Two paragraphs might be confusing, but the question is, what does the opinion say, and particularly, what does the holding say?   Elena Kagan  But again, General, I mean, the actual holding of Ake calls for assistance in evaluation, preparation, and presentation of the defense.  And the theme of Ake, if you will, is all about how we used to think that psychiatric opinions were just like one thing, but now we know better.  We know that different psychiatrists have different opinions, and it's really important to arm even an indigent defendant with the tools that he needs to come back at the State and to say -- and to say -- and to establish what he wants to establish about his mental health. I mean, that's really the theme of the opinion, that you have to give the indigent defendants, just as you give the wealthier defendant, the tools that they need to establish what they want to establish about mental health.  And then that's consistent with the -- with these words that are repeated in the holding and elsewhere.   Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  And it's not taking about parity.  All it's saying is that we recognize that the State is going to have experts, we recognize that if you had money you would have experts, we recognize that mental health is one of those things that people can have different opinions about, and that people would really like to have experts.   Elena Kagan  And we're going to give this indigent person a single one who will be able to assist him in these ways, in evaluating, preparing, and presenting the defense.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  General, that just has to be wrong as a statement of how we figure out what clearly established is.  We don't look at the facts in the QP, we look at the holding.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  This is what the holding says.  You're entitled to somebody who will assist you in evaluating, preparing, and presenting your defense.   Elena Kagan  That would be quite something, I have to say, General.  If we say: Listen, when you read our opinions and when you try to figure out what we're saying, what you have to do is go back to the QP and just narrow it to exactly what the QP said. I think that that would be a shocking way to interpret this Court's opinions.   INTERRUPTING ",16-5294

And that the rule should follow, depending on which is true.   ",16-529X
0,"Elena Kagan  Ms. Goldenberg, in those 50 years, has -- has the SEC or has the Justice Department ever set down in writing what the guidelines are for how the SEC is going to use disgorgement and what's going to happen to the monies collected?   Elena Kagan  I must say I find it unusual that the SEC has not given some guidance to its enforcement department or -- or that the Department of Justice hasn't become involved in some way; that -- that everything is just sort of up to the particular person at the SEC who decides to bring such a case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Do you agree or disagree -- I'm a little -- left a little bit unclear. Mr. Unikowsky's standard is that if something is not solely remedial, then it's a penalty.  Do you agree with that?   Elena Kagan  And you disagree with any punitive aspect.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So if something is not solely remedial, it is a penalty.   Elena Kagan  Because I look at this and -- and it seems to be a commonsensical kind of way of looking at the way this remedy works, the way the SEC has used it, is that it's trying to do a lot of things. It's trying to compensate.  It's trying to deter.  It's trying, to some extent, to punish misconduct that it -- it sees, you know, and that it's a little bit artificial to try to tear them apart.  And then if you accept Mr. Unikowsky's standard, that suggests that he has the better of the arguments. So why is that wrong?   Elena Kagan  Yeah, but I guess -- I guess when I said ""punish,"" I don't mean to make that sound as a conclusion.  I mean just to say, it's tied to -- to particular misconduct.  So -- so it's -- it's very much relating to a -- an offense.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Just -- just out of curiosity, when -- I'm sorry.   ",16-529X
1,"Elena Kagan  I'm --   Elena Kagan  I'm sorry, Mr. Fisher.  You just said something that I think you did not say in your briefs, so let me ask you about that. You just gave us your definition of what the generic offense is.  It's understand 16. Because I understood in your briefs you just said whatever the generic offense is, it doesn't include this activity. But do you have a definition of what the generic offense is? And if so, did you just say it?   Elena Kagan  Do you have any further views of what the generic offense is? Are there other elements of the generic offense that you're willing to tell us you think? I mean usually, in these cases, first we define the generic offense, and then we see whether the State statute in question fits within that or doesn't. And so what is the generic offense? It's under 16.  Anything else?   Elena Kagan  But why would you think that, Mr. Fisher? I mean, there -- in this statute, there are loads of cross-references.  And this one is not a cross-reference.  So doesn't that tell us something?   Elena Kagan  Are you suggesting, Mr. Fisher, that if we turn Chevron off, we have to turn lenity on? Couldn't there be a middle ground between the two; in other words, some space where you say, because of this -- the -- the criminal application of this statute, we don't apply ordinary Chevron deference, but at the same time, we don't go straight into the kind of grievous ambiguity that -- that triggers lenity? There's some middle area where the Court gets to decide just what is -- it thinks is the best construction of the statute?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It works -- it works, if you think that ambiguity doesn't necessarily mean the same thing for Chevron purposes and for lenity purposes.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The lenity purposes really demands grievous ambiguity, and but there's some sense in which there's -- there's a of lack clarity, a lack of clear meaning that allows the Court to decide what the best interpretation of the language is.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I don't really understand that -- that canon, because that canon would suggest that we never give the BIA deference as to its interpretation of this statute.  And, in fact, when it comes to noncriminal things, we give the BIA very substantial deference.   ",16-54XX
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Kedem, you don't disagree, do you, with the premise that the first thing that we should do is to define the generic crime; is that right?   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So you say that's step one.  And then you say, well, you define the generic -- in this case you say the generic crime is whatever is illegal under State law.  That's one of your --   Elena Kagan  Yeah.  So that seems to be like just not what generic crimes are.   Elena Kagan  In other words, you're just saying, well, it's whatever the States consider illegal, when the whole idea of a generic crime is that it's not just anything that's illegal, it's the prototypical case, even though that differs from what some States do.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  But you're carving out one element, which is the age element --   Elena Kagan  -- and saying whatever a State does goes.  So I thought that that was sort of the antithesis of the generic offense approach.   Elena Kagan  It's really like a freshman in college going out with a junior in college.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kedem, you have here -- you have a federal statute.  You have the Model Penal Code, which goes the same way.  You have 30-plus State laws.  So at the least, am I right that -- that you concede that you can't win unless Chevron applies; is that correct?   Elena Kagan  You think it's unambiguous, this kind of pragmatic construction about -- what did you say -- like power differentials --   Elena Kagan  I -- I guess I don't understand that.  You're saying that it would be the -- the clearly better reading to go -- to -- to say notwithstanding the Federal statute, notwithstanding 30-plus State statutes, notwithstanding the Model Penal Code, we just know that when somebody talks about sexual abuse of a minor, they're talking about age 18 with a three-year differential?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I'm asking --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- about normal statutory interpretation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The normal statutory interpretation get you to think that out of, like -- out of our heads pops 18 plus a three-year differential --   Elena Kagan  -- looking at -- as opposed to looking at 30-plus States, the Model Penal Code, and the Federal statute, which all define it differently.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Kedem, can I say that --   Elena Kagan  -- I think you disagree with two parts of that.  Because the first thing you said to me was that you agree that the first thing that has to be done is to define a generic offense.   Elena Kagan  So Justice Alito was suggesting that, in this case, we shouldn't do that at all.  So you disagree there.  And then Justice Alito said, in this case you just have to think like, what does the BIA think about this?   Elena Kagan  But you said to me, even without deference, you win.  So -- so you're taking a very different view than Justice Alito is.  You're saying that what the BIA interpretation was is the best understanding of the generic offense.   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Kedem, Mr. Fisher said and I just want to make sure that this is right, that you no longer rely on the statute that the BIA relied on; is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.  So the answer is no. So what -- what do you rely on? What are the sources that you rely on to generate this definition? Because you're not relying on the Federal statute.  You're not relying on the most common State statutes.  You're not relying on the other Federal statute that the BIA relied on.  What are you relying on to generate this definition?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm asking for ordinary --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The term --   Elena Kagan  So the -- the dictionary definition that you pull out is illegal sex acts performed against a minor by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance.  Is that the one?   Elena Kagan  Yeah.  But you're not using by a parent, guardian, relative, or acquaintance; is that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no, no, no.  But this -- this limits it to those relationships.   Elena Kagan  That's what this does --   Elena Kagan  Okay.  Anything else? Dictionary definition.  What else?   Elena Kagan  What are -- what are those?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  One -- one's -- one deals with the rights of child witnesses.  The other is a rule for calculating the duration of unlawful presence.   Elena Kagan  Are those the two?

1,"Elena Kagan  But why is there --   Elena Kagan  But why --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- do you think there is a real difference, Mr. Katyal, between claims in relief on the one hand, in which case, yes, you need standing too, and everything else on the other hand, in which case, there's somebody with standing who has those claims, who seeks that relief.  So the court is doing exactly what the court has authority to do, but this intervenor can contribute to the way the court is thinking about the case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So putting -- putting intervenors aside, suppose ten plaintiffs got together and brought a suit, so they were all joined in the same suit.  And the district court satisfied itself that one of those plaintiffs had standing, that there was a proper case in controversy before the court, that nobody else was asking for anything else or making any other claims. Does the district court have to go plaintiff by plaintiff by plaintiff by plaintiff, sua sponte, and decide whether each of them has standing?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think it is very odd that you can be an actual party.  And presumably, you can do all of these things, you can do -- do your own discovery, you can do -- and -- and that's fine with you, but if you're named as an intervenor, then it becomes not fine.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's great.  I mean, given that that's true, do you think -- are you saying that Congress had it in mind to track the requirements of standing, whatever they turned out to be? Because, of course, the Standing Doctrine in 1966 was nothing like what it is now.   Sarah E. Harrington  It was different, but the -- but the Standing Doctrine and intervention rules have always required that an intervenor or a party have an interest. And this Court, going back to the beginning of the 20th century, has said that you -- that an interest that is contingent or hypothetical is not sufficient for intervention, just like it had said it's not sufficient for standing. Now, the predecessor to the 1966 version of the rule allowed intervention as a right if a party would be bound by the judgment, or if a party had an actual interest in property that was going to be distributed by the court.  I think it's clear that both of those sets of -- of people would have had standing, and so that's kind of the people that I think the rule drafters had in mind.  There's certainly --   ",16-605X

0,"Elena Kagan  Could you respond to that first? Is that okay, Justice Sotomayor?   Elena Kagan  Because -- because there is -- there's no right -- there's no need to have an appellate process, but once the State has given an appellate process, there is a right to have effective assistance of counsel on appeal.  So that seems an important right.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But in -- in most States it does apply; isn't that right?   Elena Kagan  Yeah.  Yeah.  And then, General, I think that your brief did the right thing in terms of thinking about Martinez to say why did Martinez make the exception that it did and ask whether those same factors suggest an analogous exception here.  I think that that's the right way to go about thinking about this question. So, I mean, it seems to me that your main theme here is this idea that you did get one shot; is -- is that -- is that correct?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yeah --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So the unique right, I mean, I think we've talked about.  It's -- trial counsel, for sure, is the most, most, most important, but appellate counsel is pretty important too. But just let's think about this you -- you got one shot already.  I guess I'm just not sure I understand it, because it seems to me what Martinez said is, you wouldn't -- you wouldn't get a shot to make your trial -- ineffective assistance of trial counsel claim, your IATC claim, and only if we made the exception that we did would you get a shot to make that trial counsel claim. And here, similarly, only if we do the same thing will you ever get a shot to make a claim that your appellate counsel was deficient.  And people do have an independent, freestanding constitutional right to effective appellate counsel.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think if you read --   Elena Kagan  -- Martinez, Martinez basically does not talk at all about the underlying error.  It talks about the ineffective assistance claim. Now, of course, ineffective assistance is important because, you know, it's not just the lawyers there for show, it's -- it's to remedy or prevent some underlying claim. But the same is true here.  If Martinez was trying to figure out how to ensure the fairness of the trial process, this would be trying to figure out how to ensure, through effective counsel, the fairness of the appellate process.  And it seems to me quite analogous, indeed identical --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- just on a different level.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But here -- but here it's an appellate error.   Elena Kagan  But, again --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- General, you're sort of --   Elena Kagan  -- redefining it so that it fits your position.  But Martinez was about having some court evaluate the ineffective assistance of trial claim, and this is about having some court evaluate the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim. And is there an underlying thing that we're trying to get at? Sure.  In Martinez, it was ineffective assistance of trial counsel to ensure that the trial process was fair.  Here, it's -- it's -- it's having some court litigate the ineffective assistance of appellate counsel claim in order to ensure that the appellate counsel is fair.  So the two are quite analogous.   Elena Kagan  It -- it ends, I think -- you're exactly right.  And I think it ends where the Constitution gives out.  Because we've said that although the State does not have to set up an appeals process, once it sets up an appeals process, you are entitled to effective counsel in it.  And so that's where it ends.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  And then there was Martinez.  And as you said, in Martinez and in Trevino, we really went through the three factors that you talk about in your brief: How important is this? Is this the only shot? And, you know, does the State have something to do with this, or something.  Is that the third one? And, you know, I'm -- I'm suggesting it's pretty important, and this is your only shot.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But this claim --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- is not about the underlying trial error.  This claim is about effective assistance of appellate counsel.  And -- and -- and that's about ensuring that the appellate process has integrity and fairness attached to it.   Elena Kagan  But, General, that assumes that a -- that some court is going to say, if there was a trial error that we can see out there, then there was ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.  But that's not correct for many of the reasons that people on -- I mean, that everybody acknowledges.  To have ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, it's not because you failed to make an argument about any old trial error; it's going to be a special and rare thing.   ",16-6219

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Stewart, do I understand you to no longer be relying on the argument that this is a jurisdictional rule?   Elena Kagan  Because you've been standing up there for a while now making arguments that would be true if it weren't a jurisdictional rule.   Elena Kagan  I mean, so which is it? Do you think that this is a jurisdictional -- that this is a jurisdictional rule or that it wasn't but still we should accept what the Seventh Circuit did?   Elena Kagan  But I think what Justice Ginsburg said a while ago is that when we have used that term in the past, what we've meant is that it's -- it's a -- it's a mandatory claims processing rule that you have to follow unless the party, the other party forfeits the issue --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- or unless there's a very good reason, you know, there's some kind of extra special excuse that you have.   Elena Kagan  But, you know, where there is a forfeiture and where the -- that's the end of the matter, you can call it a mandatory claims processing rule or not, but you forfeited it.   Elena Kagan  So suppose there is a congressional statute which does set forth a jurisdictional rule, and Congress wakes up one day and decides, you know what, we don't think that this rule should be jurisdictional anymore. How does it change that?   Elena Kagan  Yes.  So Congress would presumably pass a piece of legislation which no longer included the rule, right?

And you're essentially saying that we have no way to decide which standard is the standard that Congress meant when it said this. So another circuit tomorrow could say, you know, we're just not giving any funds for any mitigation investigations at all under this standard, and we would be, like, whatever. (Laughter.)   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, take this case as an example, right? So it seems to me if a judge looks at this case, a judge would say: I -- look, I don't know what you're going to find in your investigation, and it's unreasonable for me to make a judgment about what you're going to find in your investigation because that's the whole point of an investigation. But I do know that here no social history was done at all and you've got like a schizophrenic defendant, somebody who has had a mental health diagnosis of a very serious order. Well, of course, that's the kind of thing that a reasonable attorney would investigate in determining how to spend their limited resources, isn't it?   Elena Kagan  Putting aside whether those particular witnesses and what -- what -- what cross -- whether the -- and maybe just even putting those people aside, I mean, go and figure out whether there's a history of mental health issues.   Elena Kagan  Yes, but I know, you know, if you have a -- a person who has since the incident in question been diagnosed as schizophrenic, you know, some bell goes off that says I think maybe we should do some investigation and try to figure out whether he was suffering from mental health issues at the time of the incident.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, what better purposes would you spend this money on? It seems to me in this case, it's like the only thing you want to spend your money on is a mitigation investigation.  There's nothing else, really, to spend your money on.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Keller, this is the language that Martinez used.  Martinez said that these sorts of claims often require investigative work.  It said, I'm quoting again, ""they depend on evidence outside the trial record."" So the whole exception that Martinez set out, you know, seems to be premised on the idea that there's an opportunity to develop the factual basis for the IAT -- IATC claim.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, we said all this.  It often requires investigative work and it depends on evidence outside the trial record, and now you're saying we'll just take a look at this statute and say that of course it doesn't allow investigative work or evidence outside the trial record.

You spent a lot of time talking about the word ""decision"" and how habeas review is only available for decisions, not for opinions. So does your argument go that even when the -- a state court, the higher state court has issued a reasoned decision, that even there the habeas court is not limited to that decision but can and should decide whether there are other grounds?   Elena Kagan  I'm not sure I understand the question.  But suppose you said that the reasoned decision is -- is not -- is just completely wrong. Could you substitute, you know, so I think the way I've understood that that goes is that's completely wrong, so now we don't -- we don't give deference to it, right? It's taken itself out of AEDPA because it's completely wrong. Are you saying, no, there's a second step where you have to say, well, if I were the judge, I could have written a better decision that would receive AEDPA deference?   Elena Kagan  So, Ms. Warren, I take that, but it seems to me that that's the question, right? What should we presume about what the Georgia Supreme Court is doing here in -- in exactly the way you said? So let me give you a hypothetical. Let's say we have a Batson case and there was a denial of relief in the Batson case.  And -- but it was based on a very clear error of law. So somebody said -- it's a Hispanic defendant, and somebody said Hispanic defendants are not entitled to raise Batson claims.  All right? And -- and then the -- the supreme court, the state supreme court just says affirmed.  All right? So what should we understand about that? Why -- why is the state court doing that? What -- what -- what's the reasonable assumption about what the state court is doing?   Elena Kagan  You see, this is -- it seems a very odd thing to say the Georgia Supreme Court looked at an opinion and said that is such a bad opinion, it has such a clear error of federal constitutional law, but we are not going to explain that to anybody.  Instead we're just going to affirm.  Now, that's one option. The other option is that the Georgia Supreme Court had a bad day, and it too made an error.  And the question is, and I suppose, you know, Ylst answered this question, but it seemed to me to answer it in a pretty reasonable way.  It's like we just don't expect state supreme courts to say that's a clear error of federal constitutional law and we are not going to tell anybody about it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  Here there is, there's another basis, but -- but you have to believe that what the state court is saying, even though this -- this lower state court made an error of federal constitutional law, because we can dream up something better, we'll just affirm it.  We won't tell anybody what we're -- what we think is an alternative basis.  We won't do anything.  We'll just let it be out there.  That judge will think that he's done a fine job.  Everybody else will think that he's done a fine job.  We'll just leave it out there because, what, because we can't be bothered to write two sentences saying, you know, we're affirming on a ground where, you know, yes, of course, he's entitled to make a Batson claim, but he had a bad Batson claim?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, it seems to me that that just makes a bizarre assumption about state courts, that they're so uninterested in errors of federal constitutional law that they're just going to say, well, as long as we have something in our heads that suggests that the ultimate judgment was right, we're not going to tell anybody about them.  We're going to leave them out there as -- as something that the judge and the parties and -- and future judges and future parties will think was right when we know it's wrong.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, didn't Ylst tell us what we should generally draw from silence? It just says the maxim is that silence implies consent, not the opposite.  Courts generally behave accordingly, not always, but generally affirming when -- without further discussion when they agree, not when they disagree, with the reasons given below. And that was -- you know, there was a different context.  As you say, it was procedural versus merits.  But that basic reasoning was not limited to -- to the context. It was -- it was a more general understanding of what silence means, or generally should be taken to mean, with respect to state supreme courts.  Why wasn't it right?   Elena Kagan  What if the -- the state supreme court says, you know, we think that this opinion is clearly wrong, but we're going to -- we're good lawyers and we're going to think of another opinion that could have been written.  It wasn't, but it could have been.  And -- and we're going to affirm on that ground.  Of course, we're not going to say this; we're just going to say affirm.  But -- but the thing that I'm thinking is this habeas petitioner has never been presented with this alternative argument. So it might be that this habeas petitioner would have a really good response to this alternative argument, but he doesn't even know that it's in the case.  That seems quite unfair to the habeas petitioner, to say your petition is denied, not to tell him why, even though he's never been given the chance to respond to this new reasoning.   ",16-6855

Elena Kagan  Ms. Ho --   Elena Kagan  -- can I -- can I take you back to this question of where you would draw the line --   Elena Kagan  -- between ex parte and inter partes reexamination on the one hand and this? Because, as I understand what you would permit, those proceedings too can be initiated by a third party -- you know, can be at the request of a third party, and -- and those -- in those proceedings too, the third party can participate in some way, can file a reply to the patentee's statement, can make known its views. So what's the line? Where would you -- what are the procedures that are here that you think make this essentially adjudicatory that are not in those other proceedings?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I didn't say they fall out.  There are opportunities for it to make known its views as to what --   Elena Kagan  So what is it? Is it discovery? Is it -- is it participation in the hearing? I mean, I just want to ground this in something.   Elena Kagan  But what -- what's the most that the government could do, do you think?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You know, what's the -- what are the -- how many of these things do you have to take away before you have a constitutional system?   Elena Kagan  Well, one understanding of this, Ms. Ho, is that this is the government in a real sense.  It's the government trying to figure out whether it made a mistake by granting the patent, which the government sometimes does and knows it sometimes does, but the government wants to put in place a set of procedures that will actually increase the government's accuracy in figuring out whether it made a mistake. And that involves listening to a third party that has some interest in the proceeding. So it seems a little bit odd to say, sure, the government can reexamine this, the government can allow a third party to request it, can allow the third party to do some things, but there's some line that falls short of what the government thinks are the procedures that enable the greatest accuracy. So why -- why would we do that?   Elena Kagan  No, no, no.  There are administrative law judges all over this country, aren't there?     I'm sorry? The -- (Laughter.)     The -- the chief judge, as I understand these situations, was concerned that the panel as initially composed was likely to diverge from general PTAB precedent with respect to a matter that bore on the institution decision, and so the chief judge expanded the panel.  It's not clear whether the chief judge picked judges that he had a particular reason to think would be sympathetic to a particular view or --   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Stewart --   Elena Kagan  How important, Mr. Stewart, is judicial review here? I mean, would you concede that there's a constitutional problem, either if there's no judicial review at all or if the judicial review were deferential as to matters of law?     I -- I wouldn't -- I would concede that it would be a constitutional concern.  I don't think it would be an Article III concern.  I think it would be a due process concern, that the person was being divested of property, potentially, without due process of law. So I -- I'm very happy that we have judicial review.  I would like to say something about the standard of review there because I think it's important. As -- as your question points out, the -- the cancellation is not going to deprive the courts of any role in determining whether the patent was actually valid.  The effect of the cancellation is simply going to be that the court will defer to the agency under a substantial evidence standard on questions of fact and will review legal issues de novo. And that's a less favorable standard of review for the patentee than would be applied in district court infringement litigation, where the defendant would have to prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence. But our view is that's a feature and not a bug of the system.  That is, we want a standard of review that will take into account what the agency actually thinks.  The justification for the clear and convincing evidence standard is the agency is on record, having issued the patent, as thinking that the patent is valid, and, therefore, the -- the court should be not entirely unwilling but reluctant to set that aside, absent clear and convincing evidence. If -- if we can find out that, no, the PTO's current informed view is that the patent is valid, then it's entirely appropriate to have a standard of review that -- that takes that into account.  The point that I was making about cases like Stern versus Marshall is those are cases that -- that the jurisdiction, the work of the federal courts is not defined in terms of legal issues that they can resolve. It's defined in terms of types of disputes that they can resolve. And a dispute about whether one party will be required to pay money to another party is a case that's kind of the classic work of Article III courts.  And so this Court has grappled and some would say struggled with the question of when is it okay to allow non-Article III federal officials to do that? You don't really need to get to that question because, here, nobody is asking to hold Petitioner liable.  The effect of a cancellation is not the Petitioner has to pay money damages.   Elena Kagan  Well, if I could just --   Elena Kagan  -- I mean, because there are formal adjudications all over the place in agencies.  I mean, for example, the NLRB runs by formal adjudications and, indeed, when they try to make rules, Congress slaps them down and says we want adjudications. So how is that different?

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, still, Ms. Blatt, there is a -- you know, there would be a simple way of accomplishing what you think this provision accomplishes.  You know, something along the lines of just saying any plan maintained by a church-affiliated organization is a church plan or something like that. It's -- it's very odd language, this statutory language, and I'm wondering why you think that Congress chose to do what you think it chose to do in this perplexing way rather than in a straightforward way?   Elena Kagan  Mr. Stewart, can I ask you about some of the Respondents' hypotheticals where they offer hypothetical statutes that are very similar in structure to this one? And it's pretty clear that you would read, you know, the one about disabled veterans and the one about the two presidential criteria, and it's pretty clear that you would read those sentences their way rather than your way; in other words, as just going to one of the criteria.  And I'm wondering why you think that's true, that they can come up with these hypotheticals that so clearly should be interpreted their way rather than your way.   Malcolm L. Stewart  I guess I would say about the -- the hypothetical that is used most often -- most often, person disabled and a veteran includes a member of the National Guard.  I think if you read it absolutely literally, you would still say a National Guard member who is not disabled is covered.  Now, I think the --   Elena Kagan  I mean, that would seem ridiculous, right?   Malcolm L. Stewart  I think the instinct -- the -- the context would be such that courts would assume, I believe, that Congress had simply made a -- a sort of scrivener's error, that Congress had used language sloppily. Part -- part of that has to do with the instinct that I -- I alluded to earlier.  That is, we would tend to regard a provision like that as one in which Congress was really trying to explain what the term ""person who is disabled and a veteran"" means, and so we would strain to read the definition in a way that made it consistent.  If Congress passed a statute that said something like: Person who is disabled and a veteran shall include any Federal employee with 30 years or more of service, at -- at that point, we would understand Congress has just abandoned the effort to explain what person who is disabled and a veteran actually means.  It has decided for whatever reason that it wants employees with -- Federal employees with unusually long service to get the same benefits as a disabled veteran would get under a particular statute and has used shorthand to -- to accomplish that.   Elena Kagan  See, I -- I would think that the way that hypothetical works, it's sort of -- we're setting these two criteria, you have to be a veteran and you have to be disabled, and then we're going to say there's a special case of veterans.  We also mean to include National Guard folks, and that's not disqualifying, the fact that it's a National Guard folks.  But the two criteria are still the two criteria. All we're suggesting is that it's not disqualifying that you are a National Guard.  And you could read this language similarly.  It's not disqualifying that it's maintained by a different kind of organization.   Malcolm L. Stewart  I guess I -- all I would concede based on these hypotheticals is that sometimes a provision that is structured in this way will give rise to the natural inference that Congress wanted to do something other than simply deem a particular thing to fall within the whole defined term and that it had in mind a part. But I think, in construing this provision, it may be helpful to look at page 24 of the government's brief which explains -- which kind of clarifies something that Ms. Blatt was referring to earlier, that -- that on page 24 of the -- the government's brief, we lay out the way in which this amendment changed from the time it was first introduced in 1979 to when it was enacted in 1980. And as the questioning in the first part of your argument explained, the original introduced provision said a plan established and maintained by a church shall include a plan established and maintained by a principal-purpose organization.  And so the -- the words ""established and"" appeared two places in that introduced provision.  And as -- we agree with Ms. Blatt that the most likely explanation for what -- why Congress took out the -- the second ""established and"" was that it was worried about plans that would fall between two stools, a plan that was established by a church, but maintained by a principal-purpose organization.  That the --   Elena Kagan  Well, but I guess that's the question, right?   Malcolm L. Stewart  But -- but --   Elena Kagan  And the structure is the same.   Malcolm L. Stewart  I -- I guess the point I was going to make about -- if I -- if I could finish this?   ",16-74XX

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Walsh?   Elena Kagan  Could I take you back to Justice Alito's question, perhaps just put a little bit of a different spin on it? I mean, if you look at 546(e), it's clearly an exception to the avoidance power.  It says ""notwithstanding"" all these sections which deal with avoidance, the trustee may not avoid the following transfers. So, I mean, it seems odd to read that in any other way than to start with the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid.  Why should we not do that? Why isn't that exactly what the text tell us -- tells us to do, where you start with the transfer that the trustee seeks to avoid and then you ask whether there's a safe harbor that applies to that transfer?   Elena Kagan  I guess you're asking a court to make a shift in transfers in the middle of the analysis.  In other words, first, the court has to say whether this is the kind of transfer that the trustee can avoid, and in doing that, the court is looking at the -- what you call the end-to-end transfer. And then all of a sudden, when it comes to the safe harbor, you're saying that the trustee has to flip and look at another transfer entirely.  And that seems like a strange thing for a safe harbor to do. I mean, usually what we think is that, you know, a safe harbor would shield from avoidance a transfer that's being challenged, rather than a transfer that isn't being challenged.

Elena Kagan  So that -- that might be right. I was trying to think of cases in which there could be mischief by relying entirely on the trustee's power to define the transfer. And here is what I came up with, is that there truly is a transfer from a debtor to a bank, if the bank's not serving as an intermediary, it is a real transfer of stock, right? And now, 546 -- 546(e) is going to prevent the trustee from avoiding that.  But then the trustee says: So, in order to get around 546(e), I'm going to define the transfer differently, I'm going to ask where the bank then transferred the stock and -- and -- and say that the transfer that I want to avoid is from the original debtor to whoever it was that the bank transferred the stock to, even though those really were two separate transactions. Could the trustee play games like that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  What do you think is wrong, Mr. Clement, with the alternative approach? If I understand the alternative approach, which Justice Kennedy was referring to, it's more of a functional analysis; you ask who has dominion and control of a particular piece of property at a particular point.

I didn't kill my family.  You can't say I killed my family. But there are different levels of generality, right? One is you can't say that I didn't kill my family.  One is you -- you -- you can't say that I committed the actus reus no matter what the actus reus is.  And another is you can't say that I committed any element of the offense, actus reus or otherwise. And if I understood your argument, you're saying that the logic of your position takes you from this case, which is an actus reus of killing, to any actus reus and then further from there to any element. And I guess I wonder, why is it that the logic of your position insists that we go up that chain?   INTERRUPTING ",16-8255
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, for sure we've given lawyers a lot of leeway to make quite a number of decisions when they're representing a defendant, troubled and untroubled, and the idea is that lawyers know better, sometimes, than their clients and that we should want to lodge a great many strategic decisions in their hands rather than in the client's. But you're not talking about here, or we're not talking about here, about how to pursue a set of objectives.  Is it better to pursue it this way or is it better to pursue it that way? We're talking about a client saying: You have to follow -- I have -- I have an overriding objective in this case, and that's to avoid the opprobrium that comes with admitting that I killed family members.  And that's my overriding objective. And you're saying that the lawyer can say it doesn't matter that that's your overriding objective.  And I guess what I want to know is why.   Elena Kagan  But the client is saying that -- that his ultimate objective is not to defeat the death penalty.  In other words, you just have conflicting objectives. I mean, I totally understand that this lawyer was in a terrible position because this lawyer wants to defeat the death penalty.  And he has a client who says: That's not my goal here. But the question is, when that happens, does the lawyer have to step back and say: You know what? That's not his goal.  His goal is to avoid admitting that he killed his family members.   Elena Kagan  He --   Elena Kagan  But, Ms. Murrill, I -- I think all these questions go to the same point, which is Strickland seems a very awkward fit here because there's nothing wrong with what this lawyer did if the goal is avoiding the death penalty.  This lawyer probably did the best thing, the thing that a good lawyer would do if the goal were avoiding the death penalty. The problem that this case presents is something different.  It's the lawyer's substitution of his goal of avoiding the death penalty for the client's goal, as the Chief Justice said, I don't care about that.  I don't want to avoid the death penalty.

(Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  But this is what he says.  He might not agree with this anymore, who knows, but -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  -- he says, ""What reasonable citizen wouldn't bear a rightly diminished view of the judicial process and its integrity if courts refuse to correct obvious errors of their own devise that threaten to require individuals to linger longer in federal prison than the law demands, especially when the cost of correction is so small?"" And I take that to be combining three things.  First, you have a deprivation of liberty.  Second, you have a -- an error, as he says, of your own devise; in other words, the court has something to do with it.  The -- the probation officer has messed up, and then the court hasn't caught the error.  And -- and, third, that the cost of correction is small, certainly relatively smaller. And you package those three things together and you get a -- you know, a rule that treats these kinds of errors differently, that does mean that they're routinely, as opposed to sparingly, corrected.   Elena Kagan  Why isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I think what they're --   Elena Kagan  I -- I mean, he could probably do it better than I can.   Elena Kagan  I think what this is saying is, yes, the reasonable citizen, assuming this great reasonable citizen exists, you know, would think all of those things, but he would say here's this particular kind of error, and -- and it's rare that all of these three things come together. Deprivation of liberties, that's pretty common.  But low costs, that's not so common.  And the fact that the error is of the court's own making, that's really uncommon.

But I think it -- it seems to me all these, 1, 2, and 3, run smack into Molina-Martinez, which, you know, basically rejected all of these arguments and said it doesn't matter if your sentence ends up in the middle because the -- the range does something.  It anchors people's sentencing determinations, and it anchors them sufficiently so that even if you could have reached that sentence regardless of the range being wrong, we think the error in the range matters and is likely to matter in the great majority of cases. And you're suggesting that we ignore everything we said about that now.   Elena Kagan  Well, but there again Molina-Martinez is against you, right, because, in that case, we talked about the fact that a remand for resentencing -- I'm quoting now -- ""while not costless, does not involve the same difficulties as a remand for retrial.""

And we said, you know, that the resources are not sufficient for us to take that seriously here.   ",16-9493
0,"Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand why the exact same rationale wouldn't apply here.  In other words, you know, a member of the military assaults somebody on a military base and Congress decides: We don't want that assault to be prosecuted in the state court.  We want that assault to be prosecuted within a military -- a system of military justice. So Congress is essentially doing the same thing.  Look, the regular state courts are not suited to decide some set of cases.  We're going to set up a different set of courts; territorial, on the one hand; on this hand, partly territorial but also defined by subject matter.   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, I think it is --   Elena Kagan  By people, really.   Aditya Bamzai  I think it is different in relevant respects.  And the -- the Court's decisions in this area have treated those -- these two types of courts differently. And so, for example, Ex parte Vallandigham or the Gordon versus United States case, which we cite in our brief, are about military courts and about the initial incarnation of the Court of Claims. And this Court denied jurisdiction and said that it could not directly review either of those courts. That contrasts with the Court's approach to United States versus Coe from a territorial court.  And so there -- there must be a line that can be drawn between territorial courts and these other types of adjudicatory bodies that are within the executive branch. And I submit that the line that I have proposed is the easiest and best line that explains all the cases, as well as allows the -- the court to say that all bodies that are within the executive branch cannot be subject to this Court's direct review.   Elena Kagan  Well, but how does that really fit with the language of Article III, Section 2? Because what Article III says is ""The judicial power shall extend to all cases"" and then talks about in those cases or in various ones of them, ""the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction."" Now there might be uncertainty as to what cases means with respect to a good many things, but I would have thought that when we're talking about the proceeding here, which is a criminal prosecution with big criminal sentences, including the death penalty, I would have thought that those criminal prosecutions are indeed cases under the language of Article III.   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, I think the answer to that question is that Marbury establishes that it's more than simply a case that triggers this Court's jurisdiction, that there's something to the language of original and appellate, and original jurisdiction because it's specified in the Constitution by implication means that appellate jurisdiction can only be exercised from certain types of bodies. And, incidentally, that is not only the position that Chief Justice Marshall embraced in Marbury, but it's also the position that Alexander Hamilton embraced in the Federalist Papers, it was proposed at a number of the state conventions ratifying the Constitution and embraced by a number of the cases that the Court decided in its early years that are cited in our brief. And so I think that answers why it's not simply a matter of a case, and one could understand the dispute between Marbury and Madison --   Elena Kagan  So, if I understand your answer --   Aditya Bamzai  Yes.   Elena Kagan  -- you're not pointing to anything in Article III, is that correct? You're pointing instead to Marbury and saying that the principle derives from there, but I could look at Marbury and say: You know, what -- what Chief Justice Marshall was talking about was James Madison handing around commissions, nothing to do with criminal prosecutions.   Aditya Bamzai  Your Honor, I do believe that I'm pointing to something in Article III, and that's the original and appellate jurisdiction provisions and the appropriate structural inferences that can be made from that.   Elena Kagan  But -- but that's all with reference to the cases.  ""The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction"" over these various cases.  It doesn't talk about, you know, which particular courts or whether somebody's exercising which particular powers. It just talks about cases.   Aditya Bamzai  That is true.  That's true.  It does not say which particular courts. It is not specified in so many words.  But Marbury has that principle, as does, for example, Justice Story in his Commentaries on the Constitution, in which he says that appellate jurisdiction must be exercised from a body that is exercising judicial authority and cloaked with judicial power. And so I think that that principle was embraced by the people who wrote Article III, and it's a principle that this Court ought to apply in this case.   ",16-961X

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Castanias, can I ask how your statutory argument works, given your position on canceled claims?   Elena Kagan  If I understand your position on canceled claims, it's that the Board need not render a decision as to those claims.  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  So I guess what's the difference between a canceled claim and a non-instituted claim? In other words, both were originally in the petition.  Both are no longer in dispute. So, with respect to the one, you say it's perfectly consistent with the statutory language that the Board did not render a decision.  Then why not with respect to the other as well?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So I understand there's a practical difference, but I was looking for -- because you say that your view is commanded by the statute and particularly, I think, by this phrase ""challenged by the petitioner."" But if you were right about the statutory language, that would apply to canceled claims as well? It was challenged by the Petitioner in the original petition.   Elena Kagan  And this one is also no longer in dispute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And I think what the Board would say is that the same thing is true here, there's nothing to adjudicate because they've said that it doesn't pass the threshold, so they're not in the business of adjudicating it.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, what language in the statute distinguishes between the canceled claim and the non-instituted claim?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, one of the stories that the statute as written seems to tell is of great discretion to the Board with respect to the institution decision.   Elena Kagan  It says you never have to institute; it's your choice whether to institute; you can't get review of the institution decision, which is our Cuozzo case; you get to write your own rules about the institution decision, which is the -- the rule-making delegation. So it's a little bit odd to say, well, here's the one thing you don't have discretion over when it comes to institution: you can't say these claims but not those claims. In a -- in a context in which Congress said the institution decision is really for the Board, it's a discretionary decision that lies in its bailiwick, why should we carve out that one thing?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Castanias, while we're on the statute, I understand that this is your argument for why there has to be a final decision with respect to every claim challenged, by, you know, however you -- but you're still saying that -- that you're not challenging the -- the partial institution.

0,"Elena Kagan  But, General, if I can take you back to Justice Ginsburg's question because it seems as though you are effectively turning 8(d)(1) into a kind of safe harbor in this sense: 8(d)(1) says that these confirmation procedures are a permissible part of the program, even though part of the confirmation procedures are about not voting. So that's clear that 8(d)(1) says that.  But you are trying to take that and convert it into something bigger and broader, essentially saying if you use these confirmation procedures, your entire program is going to be insulated from criticism, even though there's another part of your program that explicitly relies on non-voting. And I don't see that as in any way being the point of 8(d)(1).  You're trying to take 8(d)(1), which says, sure, you can have a part of the program that does this, and turn it into a much bigger and broader safe harbor for everything that you do.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I -- I must say I don't understand the -- I think this is a little bit of a different question, but since you've raised it, the proximate cause argument, I don't understand, because essentially what the Ohio program does is it says non-voting, failure to respond, non-voting. And you're trying to pick out the middle piece of that and say that's the only proximate cause.  That's just not the way we think of proximate cause in any area.   Elena Kagan  No -- no argument on that.  Sure, there's a proximate cause test, but there's more -- you know, there's more -- there can be more than one proximate cause in the world.   Elena Kagan  Well, isn't that just adding a word into the statute that Congress wrote? The statute -- Congress said by reason to vote.  There are multiple places in the U.S. Code where Congress wants to say sole -- you know, solely by reason, and Congress says it. It means something different because there are lots of situations in which two components together cause something. And so to add that word ""solely"" is to change the meaning of the statute.  And that word is not in this provision.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Which -- which two? The --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The HAVA and the NFRA -- NVRA provision?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Okay.   Elena Kagan  General, everybody is looking here for a way to reconcile these two provisions.  I mean, you're right, these two provisions are like, okay, what do we do with these? But why isn't the obvious way to reconcile the two provisions just to say, look, you got this failure-to-vote clause, but don't think that this failure-to-vote clause bars a state from using the confirmation procedures. It doesn't bar a state from using the confirmation procedures.  That can be a permissible part of the state program. So that's your way to reconcile the two things.  Taken on its own, the failure-to-vote clause looks as though it might bar confirmation procedures.  The confirmation procedure says, no, not these.   Elena Kagan  But the solely clause in HAVA --   Elena Kagan  -- is a completely independent provision in a completely independent statute.  I mean, it's not the clarifying amendment, which we can talk about, and the solely clause is -- it's a part of a -- a different provision in a different statute dealing with a related but different subject matter. So there would be no reason to take one provision that says solely, and says because that provision says solely, we're going to treat this provision as also saying solely when this provision does not say solely. In fact, we have a rule against that in statutory interpretation.  Usually, we say, look, Congress knows how to do a solely provision.  It didn't do it here.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's exactly what the clarifying amendment says.  You're exactly right.  It says don't -- don't interpret the failure-to-vote clause as preventing use of the confirmation procedures. And that's my point about how these two things are reconcilable.  The clarifying amendment says how they're reconcilable.   Elena Kagan  Don't -- don't interpret the failure-to-vote clause as barring the confirmation procedures.  States can use the confirmation procedures, but that doesn't mean that they can do anything else that they want to on top of the confirmation procedures.   Elena Kagan  General, it would be right, isn't it -- I think you acknowledge this -- that if your position is correct, that the failure to vote clause simply doesn't apply to removal programs for change of residence.  Is that correct?   Noel J. Francisco  Your Honor --   Elena Kagan  Because, of course, all those programs have to use the confirmation procedures, and your position --   Noel J. Francisco  Yeah.   Elena Kagan  -- is that if you use the confirmation procedures, that's a -- basically, that's an out for everything?   Noel J. Francisco  That's correct, but it does have much broader application.  If they --   Elena Kagan  Not much broader application, because how could you possibly use failure to vote to -- for, you know, mental incapacity or criminal convictions.  What broader application does it have?   Noel J. Francisco  Well, what I think it is -- it does a couple of things.  One of the principal things -- issues at the time the NVRA was passed was what you put your finger on.  This practice among some states of having a kind of use-it-or-lose-it mentality to the right to vote, you either exercise it or you lose it.  And they definitely wanted to take that off the table. The other thing they wanted to do was make sure that you could never use failure to vote to conclusively presume that any other basis for removal was met.   Elena Kagan  Right.  But I guess what I'm asking, General, is sort of two related questions.  Number 1, if the effect of your position is to say, look, we don't mean for this failure-to-vote clause to apply to programs about change of residence, why didn't Congress just say that? That's Number 1. And, Number 2, I mean, I -- I can see the point that it's not -- it doesn't make the failure-to-vote clause completely meaningless, but I'm still looking for the place where it has some real impact on anybody's --   Noel J. Francisco  Sure.   Elena Kagan  -- voting programs.   Noel J. Francisco  And I think it's because, and this comes out in some of the legislative history, prior to the NVRA, states simply used failure to vote as a proxy for the whole panoply of grounds for removal. They didn't necessarily tie it to this basis or that basis.  And Congress was very concerned about simply relying on the failure to vote. So they wanted to take it completely off the board.  And (b)(2) is the only provision in this statute that takes it completely off the board and says nobody can ever be -- be removed merely for their failure to vote. But when you combine non-voting with the 8(d) process, the very protective process that Congress set that required everybody to improve their procedures, there's simply nothing in the statute that prohibits that, and the clarification amendment makes that even clearer.   Elena Kagan  But with respect, General, I don't think you answered either of the two questions that I asked you, so I'll try again. Why wouldn't they just have said the failure-to-vote clause doesn't apply to -- to -- to -- to where a state uses the confirmation procedures?   Noel J. Francisco  Well, Your Honor, I -- I don't know the answer to that.  And I would say that the NVRA is not one of these statutes that I would hold up as a paradigm for legislative draftsmanship, but --   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So the second question is what is left of the failure-to-vote clause, practically speaking?   Noel J. Francisco  It takes completely off the table using failure to vote as a conclusive presumption for any other ground for removal.   Elena Kagan  Well, what other ground are we talking about?   Noel J. Francisco  Well, prior to the   Elena Kagan  I mean, it's not -- nobody used it as a presumption for mental incapacity.   Noel J. Francisco  Well, Your Honor, actually, the legislative history makes clear that prior to the NVRA, they used it as a presumption for meeting the whole panoply of different bases for removal.

1,"Elena Kagan  Other --   Elena Kagan  So, Mr. Perry, if I asked you why is it important for purposes of deciding who's an officer that the person conduct an adversarial hearing, is that what you would say, that the stakes are very high, that a person has liberty on the line?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  See, there's something that strikes me as -- as a little bit odd about this argument because, if you -- if you -- we just take a step back a little bit.  I mean, you have some real complaints about this process and how it happened and the bias that you think the ALJ showed. And if that's a problem, it's a hard context in which to think that the solution to the problem is greater -- the greater political accountability that comes from the Appointments Clause.  In other words, this is a situation where we have adjudications, where we typically think we want the decision-maker to be insulated from political pressures. So wouldn't putting those decision-makers even closer to the political body only exacerbate the problem that you're complaining of?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's hard --   Anton Metlitsky  -- even though they have the same --   Elena Kagan  It's hard to think, Mr. Metlitsky, that Freytag really thought that that was all important.  You know, they don't talk about the power of contempt until the second half of the opinion. In the first half of the opinion, they're just talking about we can respond to discovery violations without necessarily suggesting that they're talking about the contempt power. So, if you just read that first part of Freytag, you'd get no sense that it's crucial to the decision that there exists this contempt power.   Anton Metlitsky  So, as we acknowledged in our brief, you could read Freytag broadly, obviously, much more broadly than the rule we're proposing, but you don't have to read it that way.  I'm not making a claim about what was in the Court's mind.  But the Court doesn't just talk about issuing discovery orders, it's talking about enforcing discovery orders. Discovery orders are normally enforced through contempt, and special trial judges, in particular, did enforce discovery orders through contempt --   Elena Kagan  I guess what strikes me --   Anton Metlitsky  -- and that was --   Elena Kagan  -- Mr. Metlitsky, is that if you had a list and you said top 10 attributes of the judges that were involved in Freytag and the judges that are involved here, you'd pretty much say that nine of them are the same and maybe one is different. And -- but it's just so hard to get around this -- the commonalities of these judges and the judges in Freytag.   Anton Metlitsky  It's true that ALJs and the judges in Freytag share a lot of the same functions.  But what the judges in Freytag had that the judges here do not have is the thing that's always been understood to be crucial for officer status, which is the power to bind. As I said, these commissions that have been around, investigatory commissions that have been around for more than a century, all have -- this is the Warren Commission, for example, but they're mostly similar.  The Warren Commission had the power to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of any evidence that relates to any matter under investigation.  They had the power to administer oaths and affirmations.  They had the power to examine witnesses.  They had the power to receive evidence.   Elena Kagan  But why isn't it --   Anton Metlitsky  -- and what's important for officer --   Elena Kagan  -- different for that exact reason, that these are essentially investigatory bodies who are supposed to report the findings of an investigation to somebody else who's actually supposed to do something with them. But the adjudicators here are not investigators.  They are deciders.  That seems a big difference and, again --   Anton Metlitsky  Well, so --   Elena Kagan  -- seems to separate the Warren Commission type bodies from both the judges here and the judges in Freytag.   Anton Metlitsky  I -- I completely agree with that, but that would exclude, I think, the second -- the second part of the government's test, which is somebody can be an officer even if they don't have the power to bind. So the question in this case, I think, really is whether ALJs have the power to bind and whether that power is vested in their office.  That's the -- that's the, sort of, import --   Elena Kagan  Does it strike you as a little bit odd that, essentially, that would mean that the executive branch gets to decide who's an officer and who's not an officer? Right? Take the Attorney General, most of the statutes just vest this in the Attorney General.  It's then the Attorney General that delegates his power out to other people. He can decide to, he can decide not to, he can decide where it goes.  And -- and based on those decisions, it seems, you would be saying whether a particular person is an officer or not.   Anton Metlitsky  No.  So -- so the question is whether a -- a particular delegation to a particular person is lawful. So, if Congress has created an office -- so Congress has created the Office of the Deputy Attorney General, who is appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate.  That means the Attorney General is authorized to delegate to that person the authority to bind. And so that person uses that authority, for example, in the oversight of the U.S. Attorneys to direct U.S. Attorneys about how to prosecute corporations, right? That's the Thompson memo.  It's the McNulty memo. They're issued in the name of the Office of the Deputy Attorney General. If the Attorney General tried to delegate that authority to somebody that's not an officer, then that person would be -- couldn't exercise the power.   Elena Kagan  I feel -- I feel as though I'm missing something, because what you just said to me seems to make everything dependent on whether Congress has created an office.  And that can't be the only requirement, can it?   Anton Metlitsky  No.  The question is just somebody's been delegated authority.  If they're an officer -- is it -- the first question is, is it an officer function, right? If it is, then somebody that has -- only somebody that's been appointed under the Appointments Clause can exercise it.   Elena Kagan  But -- but that's what I was suggesting.   Elena Kagan  But then everything depends on whether the Attorney General in fact makes a delegation or does not make delegation.   Anton Metlitsky  Well, that's true. That's how Congress set up the scheme.  So the -- the Attorney General gets to decide which officers exercise what authority.   Elena Kagan  And -- and --   Anton Metlitsky  -- not the decisions of the --   Elena Kagan  -- they don't have authority to make binding decisions because?   Anton Metlitsky  Because the -- the question -- so the statute applicable here, 78d-1, is an authorization of delegation. Right? The Commission is allowed to delegate authority to the ALJ. And so the question is, what authority did the Commission delegate to the ALJ? So first you can look at 17 CFR 201.111(i), which is on 16A of our green brief.  It authorizes ALJs to prepare an initial decision as provided in Section 201.360. So, if you go to 201.360(d), which is on 23A of the green brief, (d)(1) says that the Commission can engage in plenary review either on petition or, you know, on its own initiative; (d)(2) says that an order won't become final and effective without the issuance of a finality order. So, in other words, the --   Elena Kagan  So everything in the end depends on that?   Anton Metlitsky  No.  We -- so there are two preconditions for our test.  The first one depends on that.  The second one is the -- the -- whatever the ALJ --   Elena Kagan  Right.  But as to the first one --   Anton Metlitsky  Yes.   Elena Kagan  -- as to whether they have binding authority, it all comes down to this finality order?   Anton Metlitsky  Yes.  They don't have bind -- well, that's why they don't have binding authority, because the Commission has to --   Elena Kagan  Even --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Metlitsky, as -- as I listen to you, and especially as I compare your test to some of the others on offer, you know, there seems to be a good deal to be said for yours, except I don't know where it's coming from, honestly. So you spent a lot of time in your brief talking like this is a historical test, this is a traditional test.   Anton Metlitsky  Right.   Elena Kagan  And I guess it seems to me like the test actually, it's sort of the opposite, the test you would make up if you were doing everything on a blank slate.  But I don't really see what the source of this test is.  So tell me what it is.   Anton Metlitsky  So -- so the source for the first part of the test that you need to have binding authority, I really -- I think is -- has been accepted at least since 1822 when the main supreme judicial court explained that an officer of the United States is somebody who has been delegated a portion of the sovereign authority of the United States, meaning the authority to bind, and that somebody whose acts don't take effect without the sanction of an officer is not an officer. That's what that opinion held and it's been understood to be authoritative since then. That -- that's essentially the Office of Legal Counsel test from 2007. The second part of the test is really I think exactly what Mr. -- Mr. Wall said. There's always going to be a question of where the legal authority to act is, because otherwise every person with discretion like every AUSA is going to be considered an officer, even though the U.S. Attorney is going to be held 100 percent accountable for every decision in his or her office. I think the -- the first place where you can see that -- that relationship of, you know, basically agent to officer is Section 27 and 28 of the First Judiciary Act with the marshal and the deputy marshal. One of the things that under Section 28 the deputy marshal was authorized to do was, when the marshal died, to execute writs in the name of the deceased marshal until a new marshal was chosen. So the -- sort of the second part of our test, which asks whether somebody's authorized to act in the name of their own office or only in the name of somebody else's office, just reflects that principle, which I think is, as we've talked about, ubiquitous in actual government practice. It's why Assistants to the Solicitor General don't need to be appointed by the president with the advice and consent of the Senate since I don't think there's a statute that actually authorizes the Attorney General to appoint them himself. If the Court has no further questions.   ",17-130X

One is by docking somebody's pay.  One is by having a removal power that you hang over your head. And another is by being the person who gets to decide who gets the job or not. And so all of these things, in some manner, tie the adjudicator more closely to the political system.  And the APA came up with this foundational compromise which had as a very significant part of it that the hearing examiners, the adjudicators, would have some detachment, would have some insulation from the political system.  Not the way an Article III judge does, but still something. And you want to ratchet that down. And the question is, isn't that interfering with decisional independence?   ",17-130X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Shumsky?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry.  Please continue --   Elena Kagan  I mean, the question is, what is the second best? We're in a world in which the first-best option, which is five people agreeing on the reasoning, that doesn't exist.  And so everything else is going to be -- is going to have some kind of problem attached to it, and we're really picking among problems. I guess what I wonder is why you say the -- the solution that we should pick is just a solution in which this Court is giving no guidance and courts are out there on their own and doing their own thing and splitting with each other, dividing with each other, not having any way to resolve these cases, which sounds like chaos to me. And the government -- what the government says is: Look, this isn't the best approach, but it's the second-best approach, is if you don't have common reasoning, just ask about results.  And if you can look at a case and know that there are five justices on the Supreme Court who think X rather than Y, then you should go with X. And we can talk about how that counts dissenting votes or, you know, give various theoretical objections to that, but, in the end, we do try to get to five here.  We know how to get to five in some of these cases, even if the five depend on different reasoning.  Why isn't that just the second-best approach?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, you carve out a set of cases, and then, when it's not completely nested in the way that you want it to be, you vote for chaos.  And I guess I'm asking, why vote for chaos in all of these cases or even in some of these cases?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Shumsky, I think -- I think your approach relies on dissents sometimes too, because take one of these logical subset cases.  You have a concurrence that is a logical subset of the plurality.  And you say, well, the concurrence controls.  And that's true even as to times where the concurrence splits off with the plurality and joins with the dissent. So you're counting dissents too, I think.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  It's necessary to the judgment, but the result of applying -- but, you know, the plurality would grant relief in this much -- this many cases.  The concurrence would grant relief in many fewer cases and deny relief in lots of cases where the dissent would also deny relief.  So, by privileging the concurrence, you're essentially saying that when the concurrence agrees with the dissent, the concurrence wins, which I take it is a way -- is -- is -- is because the concurrence plus the dissent equals five.   Elena Kagan  I'm talking about a case in which it is completely nested, but the -- but -- it is completely nested, but the concurrence is sometimes granting the relief that the plurality would but sometimes, instead, reaching the result the dissent would.

And, you know, whether you want to do, you know, shackling or we've had claims that have to do with forced medication or excessive bail.  All of these things arise in the context of a criminal proceeding but don't have anything to do with the outcomes of that proceeding, just have to do with independent liberty interests that are implicated in that proceeding.

1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Sullivan, let's say you're right, that they have not shown us how much is too much, that they have suggested that in any forum, when there's partisan advantage, the courts should be intervening. But we don't have to say something like that to deal with this case because, however much you think is too much, this case is too much. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  I mean, I think. You'll tell me I'm wrong.  But, as Justice Sotomayor said, you know, from the Governor, from Congressman Hoyer, people were very upfront about what they were trying to do here, which was to create another Democratic district.  And they did that.  Only 10,000 people had to be removed from this district as a result of one person/one vote. What -- what the Maryland legislature did was to shuffle 360,000 people out and bring in 350,000 people.  The result of that is that the district went from 47 percent Republican and 36 percent Democratic to exactly the opposite, 45 percent Democratic and 34 percent Republican. I mean, how much more evidence of partisan intent could we need?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Plus 2.  You're referring to the single election? Is -- is that what you're referring to?   Elena Kagan  I mean, Democrats have now prevailed in three straight elections, including in an election which was a wave Republican election. So the effects were exactly what the intent would suggest: A long-standing Republican incumbent is unseated by a Democratic newcomer, who withstands a wave election, who prevails three straight times. I mean, it appears that the Maryland legislature got exactly what it intended, which was you took a Republican district, like a safe Republican district, and made it into not the safest of Democratic districts but a pretty safe one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, suppose, Mr. Sullivan, that the Maryland legislature passed a statute.  What is -- Maryland is about a 60/40 Democratic/Republican state?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Is that right?   Elena Kagan  Yes, 60 -- 60/40. Suppose the Maryland legislature passed a statute and said, in the next round of reapportionment, we're going to create seven Democratic districts and one Republican district.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that is what then -- I mean, the Chief Justice said the -- the reapportionment statute is that statute.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  The districting statute is that.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But isn't -- isn't it true, Mr. Sullivan, just as a matter of fact, that most people who are independents tend to lean pretty strongly one way or the other over many election cycles?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I wasn't suggesting that they were anything in particular, just, you know, people who call themselves independents and who, in fact, are not members of a political party, you know, tend to -- not all of them, but many of them, tend to vote pretty consistently one way. And this is why when mapmakers do their mapmaking, they look not only to party registration; they look to the way people vote, and what they find is that more members than just the members of the political party -- more voters vote pretty consistently.   Elena Kagan  I guess I don't quite understand that, Mr. Sullivan.  In the racial gerrymander cases, this is exactly what we do in much harder circumstances, actually. I mean, it's the same in the sense that we look to what legislators say.  We look to what mapmakers say.  We look to a variety of pieces of circumstantial evidence about how the districting turned out, about what was done. And the reason I say it's harder there than it is here is because there we have to deal with the kind of confluence of race and politics.  But here, when you look at this kind of maneuvering and it's all about -- what else is it, except about politics? And we would look to the exact same things that we look to in our consistent line of racial gerrymandering cases.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I think my main point was that we just -- we do this, we -- we -- we -- we do it when we deal with racial gerrymandering cases, even if you want to say to me that this is no easier than that, I would say back -- I guess I would argue with that, but -- but my main point was even if it's no easier, we do it all the time.   Elena Kagan  Well, we -- we would be looking at the same things.  We would be looking at the same kind of direct evidence, the same kind of statements.  We would be looking at the same circumstantial evidence that has to do with where the lines were drawn and how they were drawn.  So it's -- it's all the same kind of evidence, isn't it?   Elena Kagan  I guess -- I guess what I was suggesting was that we're looking to the same things to discover intent in each circumstance.   ",17-333X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Hawkins --   Elena Kagan  Mr. Hawkins, I mean, I guess the question is, what is sovereign immunity and what does it entail? Even beyond the footnote in Bay Mills that the Chief Justice referenced, I think when you look at language of the kind that appears in Bay Mills and in other cases, what -- which says that, you know, if Congress wants to change it, it's up to Congress to change it, but the question is, what is the ""it""? In other words, what's up to Congress to change is deviations from the general law of sovereign immunity.  And I think what the Lundgrens are saying here is that this is not part of the general law of sovereign immunity. And this goes back to Justice Ginsburg's question, that sovereign immunity typically, by common law and historically, includes this exception for immovable property. And so that's the baseline.  It's, well, sovereign immunity, as it historically exists, except as it historically exists, it just didn't include immunity from suits that related to immovable property.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But I thought that we explained in Kiowa that foreign sovereign immunity actually started as a judicial doctrine.  It was only later that it was taken over by the political branches.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But if you look at two cases, Ms. O'Connell, one is Schooner Exchange, which talks about foreign states, and then the other is this Georgia v. Chattanooga, which is individual states in another state's jurisdiction, I mean, both of those seem to be indicating that there's this long-standing rule that when the prince goes someplace else and buys land there, he's just going to be treated like anybody else.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And it doesn't have much to do with any kind of executive action. It doesn't have much to do with the states all agreeing about something at the Constitutional Convention. It's just a sort of rule that when the prince pops up in some other jurisdiction and buys a piece of land, he's no longer the prince.   Elena Kagan  I guess what my point is -- is not whether it should be denominated an exception or not an exception but whether this is the kind of historic, traditional, long-standing rule that we -- we shouldn't expect Congress to have to put in, that it just sort of goes into the doctrine because that is part of the doctrine from long, long ago, which is a very different thing from saying, look, it's up to Congress to really -- to -- to treat -- you know, to -- to -- to start modifying terms of the doctrine that have existed for a long time.   ",17-387X
0,"Elena Kagan  I don't think that --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- that's quite true, Mr. Miller, unless -- I mean, tell me if I'm wrong, but I made a little Venn diagram for myself, and it turns out that immovable property and in rem jurisdiction, there's a large sphere of overlap, but there are definitely places where the two do not overlap. So, you know, you have your in rem about land, that's this sphere of overlap, but you can have immovable property that the action is about land and have an in personam suit, that -- tjat would be a typical trespass, something like that. And then, on the other side, you could have an in rem suit that's about movable property or you could have an in rem suit that's about land within the jurisdiction.  And that would not fall within the sphere -- with -- excuse me, within the reservation itself, within the Indian reservation, and that would not fall within the sphere of overlap. So I think that there are real differences in the scope of the immovable property exception on the one hand and an in rem exception on the other hand.  And -- and, clearly, the Washington court talked about the in rem exception.  Now you're coming in and you have an extremely strong argument about this immovable property rule, but it's not the same argument that the court in Washington made. It's not the same theory as Justice Gorsuch pointed out.  It's also just not the same categorization.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Even if it's land --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- there's still a question of where is the land, is the land on the reservation or is the land outside the reservation? If the land is on the reservation, I took you to agree with the point that that's the prince's land, and so the prince would be immune from suit.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess what I'm saying is that it becomes much -- a -- a different question, a more complicated question if you ask about a broad in rem exception or, you know, in some ways the in rem exception is broader, in some ways it's narrower. It just becomes a different question if you ask about in rem exception, one which does take you into this question of: What happens if the land is on the reservation? Then, if you say: Look, under the immovable property rule, if one sovereign owns land in another sovereign's territory, that sovereign is subject to suit there. That's not -- that's not a general in rem question.  It's a question about the immovable property rule.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But Mr. -- this is the way I sort of see what's happened in this case, and, again, you can tell me if I'm wrong.  But you took over this case and you read this opinion and you said this is not a very good theory. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  There is a really good theory here, and I'm going to make that.  And that's what good lawyers do.  I'm not at all criticizing you. It's just it's a new theory and a new -- it's not just even a new argument.  It's just a new -- it's a completely new way to win this case.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Did that happen because you had a conversation with the Solicitor General -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  -- in which the Solicitor General knew which sort of arguments you were going to make?   Elena Kagan  Yeah, I mean, as I said, I -- I think you have a -- a pretty strong, not -- you know, it looks pretty good to me right now. (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  I -- I -- I am a little bit worried about what Justice Sotomayor said, which is, you know -- you know, if we really looked harder, maybe there would be something else that would cut against this theory. I'm a little bit worried that there aren't amici who knew about this theory.  The only one who did is really the Solicitor General, because the Solicitor General generally talks to parties as the litigation goes forward. And I think it would be, I have to say, just a bad way of dealing on our part if we allowed parties to come in, even with the best of faith, and said I have a new theory for you that -- that really the only people who got a chance to reply are the Petitioners in a 20-page yellow brief.

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Aronson --   Elena Kagan  I guess I don't understand, Mr. Aronson, why the diligence argument doesn't work the same way in the second stage, after the denial, as it does in the first.  In other words, in American Pipe, what we said was, if you're relying on a class action, that's diligence enough. Now, you know, that might itself be controversial, contestable, but that's what we said in American Pipe.  And I guess, having said that, I don't see why it's also not diligence enough to rely on a new class action.   Elena Kagan  No, I don't -- I mean, it obviously didn't deal with this case, but the whole theory of American Pipe was that for any given individual, we weren't going to make them come forward; we were going to say reliance on a class action is sufficient to show diligence. So, here, these people were doing just that.  They're relying on a class action.  It happens to be a second class action, but under the same theory, they should be able to rely in order to show diligence, that that's what we said counted as diligence.   Elena Kagan  Well --   Elena Kagan  Let's suppose you're right about that, Mr. Aronson, that what Rule 23 is primarily about, it's a comparison of class actions to individual actions and saying there are times in which we think class actions is the more efficient way to do things than a million individual actions. But, again, that interest seems to be the same here because, once the class certification is denied, you're saying, well, now everybody has to come bring their individual actions. And I think what somebody who was looking at the American Pipe reasoning might say is something to the effect of: No, just as, at time one, it made more sense to have a class action than a thousand individual actions, so too, at time two, it makes more sense to have a class action than a thousand individual actions. Nothing has changed.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, here, again, of course, they didn't deal with this case.  All I'm suggesting is that both interests that they mention are served in the identical way with respect to what should happen after denial of a class certification motion as before.   Elena Kagan  Well, there was always a question in American Pipe that we were doing something extraordinary, that we were saying it doesn't matter that the statute of limitations has run on you.  And we did it for two reasons: Because we think -- thought that there was enough diligence and because we thought that Rule 23 policies indicated that we should encourage the class action device rather than the individual action device. And here, again, the exact same thing is true.  Diligence is shown in the same way by reliance on the class, and, once again, even after the denial of a single motion for class certification, Rule 23 would indicate that we don't want to have a million individual suits but instead want to encourage a class.   Elena Kagan  But that --   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Aronson, let me give you a hypothetical.  I mean, suppose it's one of these class actions where there's actually a very serious wrong and aggregate damages are very high, but each individual person's damages are very low, $32. And there's a class certification motion, and let's say in this there is -- that motion is denied for a reason that really has nothing to do with whether this is something that's properly treated by a class action. Let's suppose that, just on the individual facts of the case, this was a bad named plaintiff, not adequate -- not an adequate representative. Your theory would then say: Okay, so he's dismissed, the statute of limitations has run because these things take a long time, and then all these people with extremely valid claims, claims that we would want to be brought in order to force defendants to internalize the costs of their illegal behavior, well, too bad, that just can't go forward.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  They all have claims that are $32 claims.   Elena Kagan  But that is the entire purpose of our -- of -- of Rule 23, is that we understand that with respect to some category of claims, we're not going to have them individually or it will be so ridiculous if we have them individually that we would prefer the class action device.   Elena Kagan  Well, but, again, here, it's not working just for some reason that has nothing to do with the appropriateness of class treatment; it just has to do with the fact that one named plaintiff is not a good named plaintiff.

INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, irrespective of whether the jurisdiction has to be stated on the face of the order?   Elena Kagan  Well, Mr. Shan --   ",17-43XX
1,"Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Tripp, if -- if -- if you -- if the order doesn't have to include anything about territorial jurisdiction, how is anybody to know whether it approves interception only within the territorial jurisdiction or instead outside that jurisdiction? I mean, there's a -- there's a -- there's a choice here, depending on whether there's a mobile interception device, right? If there's a mobile interception device, you can approve interception more widely than if there's not a mobile interception device. So I would think looking at this statute -- and I recognize that it's not included in one of the things that's said in Number 4, but that Number 3, you know, just implicitly requires a court to say which one it is, is it just within the jurisdiction or is it outside the jurisdiction, because there's a mobile interception device at issue.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, how is -- I guess what I'm saying is -- I appreciate that -- but how is anybody to know unless the court says that?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I mean, they're not going to know what they can do unless the court says what they can do.   Elena Kagan  But let me say this another way, Mr. Tripp.  On 17, it says: Each order authorizing or approving the interception shall specify. And you're right, the jurisdictional thing does not appear in this list. But then, if you look at 16a, what is an order authorizing or approving the interception, on 16a in paragraph 3, it says, well, the judge enters an order authorizing or approving interception, either within the territorial jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction, depending on whether there's this mobile interception device. So it just does seem to me that that's just got to be a necessary part of an order authorizing the interception.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Where is the interception supposed to take place?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Either within the jurisdiction or outside, depending on whether there's a mobile interception device.  It's just got to be in the order because, otherwise, how would you know --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- which of those two possible things is true?   Elena Kagan  Well, no, but it is an either/or because if it's -- if there's a mobile interception device, it's both.  And if it's not a mobile interception device, it's only one.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  And that's a disjunctive thing, it's only one or it's both?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Mr. Tripp -- I'm sorry, finish your sentence.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, if you're really --   Elena Kagan  When you say ""insufficient,"" I mean, you know, the Chief Justice raises a very good point that ""insufficient"" doesn't usually mean invalid, that it usually means lacking something. So then the question is, well, was this order lacking something? And you say no, it wasn't because it didn't have to have anything about the jurisdictional reach of the interception.  And I guess I'm a little bit concerned listening to you, if we -- if we accepted that, how are these orders supposed to read? We're going to go tell every court you don't have to put anything in your order about whether this is only within the jurisdiction or outside that jurisdiction? Because, again, there are really two choices in the statute depending upon whether a mobile interception device is -- is at issue. And if we say, well, this is not insufficient because you don't have to have that, what are we going to be creating, a world of orders in which the judge doesn't tell anybody whether this is within the jurisdiction or whether it's also outside the jurisdiction?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess --   Elena Kagan  I mean, if we're talking about easy ways to resolve this case, I have to say the more I think about this, the more it seems really complicated to me, what's supposed to be in these orders and what's not supposed to be in these orders. The only thing I'm sure of in this case is that there's no core concern requirement. So why isn't that the easy way to decide this case and leave everything else for cases where actually people have briefed and addressed these questions of what has to be in and what has to be out and when you can call something insufficient and when not?

1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Zimmer, you just said defines the notice of appear.  Why do you think that those 10 requirements of what have to be in a notice to appear define a notice to appear? You could imagine a case where somebody says, well, look, Requirement 7 isn't in the notice.  That was a mistake.  So it's a flawed notice to appear, but it's still a notice to appear.  It doesn't become not a notice to appear because there's a flaw in it.   Elena Kagan  Mr. Zimmer, can I take you back to the language of the statute and just ask about your assertion that this is clearly definitional in nature? I mean, one question is, is that necessary to your argument? And then the other question is, you know, here's an alternative view of this language, which is this language is a -- it's -- it's -- it's a notice of shorthand, it's -- you know, we need to call this thing something, this -- this thing which tells you to appear in -- at removal proceedings, and this is what we're going to call it. But it doesn't suggest that everything that we say about this document is -- defines what a notice to appeal is.  So, you know, respond to that, and then tell me whether it's crucial that I agree with your response to that.   Elena Kagan  Yes.  I mean, it's obvious that the document is called a notice to appear.  But the question is whether, if the document is flawed in some way, that it becomes not a notice to appear, as opposed to just a notice to appear which is flawed in some way.

0,"Elena Kagan  Mr. Dupree, in the way you talked about it, it's not just that we have to give meaning to the term ""money."" I think you're quite right to say that the term we have to look at is ""money remuneration."" Is that correct?   Elena Kagan  And so that's really money in a -- in a compensation scheme, right? I mean, that's what that means.  Remuneration.   Elena Kagan  So let's even take your own definition, which I think that there's a lot to be said for.  Your definition tends -- of money tends to be the one that's first in the dictionaries.  So you said a generally accepted medium of exchange. But now you put that with the word ""remuneration"", in other words, in a compensation scheme, and then the question becomes: Is stock a generally accepted medium of exchange in a compensation scheme? And I would think that the answer to that is yes.  I mean, we see this all over the place, that companies give stock as well as cash in a compensation scheme, that it is a generally accepted medium of exchange for compensation.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I think partly it's because, you know, some companies might give free lunches and other companies might not give free lunches, and -- and you -- I mean, this is -- this is a kind -- instead of getting a check, you're getting stock.  Isn't that right?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well -- right.   Elena Kagan  But you can --   Elena Kagan  -- you can take it in stock.  You can take it in cash. Ninety-three percent of -- of some of these companies' employees just take it in cash; forget about the stock. So why isn't it just, you know, you can get it in cash, you can get it as a stock option or in stock when that matures; it's a generally accepted medium of exchange?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But that's why -- I mean, in your briefs, you keep on saying you can't take a stock option to a grocery store. But I think -- and that's obviously right. But I think what I'm saying is that would be a relevant question if all we were asking is what's the definition of money.  But that's not what we're asking.  We're asking what's the definition of money remuneration. So the fact that you can't take a stock option to a grocery store is irrelevant to that question.  The question is that, when it comes to compensation, is a stock option used interchangeably with money? And, I think in this company and many others, it is.  Isn't it?   Elena Kagan  Well, let me ask another question, Mr. Dupree, just to test this a little bit.  So let's say a company has two employees, and one employee makes $200,000 in cash and is granted $5 million in stock-based compensation.  Two hundred thousand plus five million.  And the other employee is just given $250,000 in cash. Now who makes more money?   Elena Kagan  Right.  So the answer to my question is, of course, the guy who gets the $5 million in stock makes more money.

So we're in one of these ""where, as here"" situations where Congress has declared that a decision is going to be governed by consideration of particular factors.  And -- and Taylor seems to say: Look, what we need for intelligent appellate review is for the district court to clearly articulate why he did what he did. Now it doesn't have to be lengthy.  It can just be pointing to, you know, this was a serious crime, here's -- here's why, the end. But -- but there has to be something, says Taylor.  No?   Elena Kagan  Can I go back --   Elena Kagan  And your -- your understanding where -- the language that I read you in Taylor where it said that there is some necessity to state some amount of reasoning, what do you think that that applies to?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, is Taylor just about the statute? In Taylor, is that all it's about? Because, certainly, Taylor seemed to suggest a broader rule.  It said, you know, where, as here, Congress has directed a district court to consider particular factors, in order to have effective appellate review, we need some brief statement about why the court has come out the way it has based on those factors.   Elena Kagan  There's a -- there's another statutory section, which is 3583(e), which directs courts to consider the 3553(a) factors, those -- these same factors that are involved in this case, when terminating periods of supervised release. Do you think a judge can terminate a period of -- of supervised release and send somebody back to prison without any statement of reasons?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I'm sorry. Hypothetically what?   Elena Kagan  Well, a basis.  But the question is, do you think that the court has to state reasons to send somebody back to prison under 3583(e)?   Elena Kagan  It doesn't say anything about explanation.  So I'll give you the relevant things.   Elena Kagan  It basically says you have to consider the 3553(a) factors.  But then it does not say that you have to explain anything. So the question is whether there's a background rule that says --   Elena Kagan  -- of course, before you send somebody back to prison like that, you have to at least say something.  That's the question.   Elena Kagan  Well, that's true, but this case involves what the Petitioner calls a disproportionality; that at the first instance you got the low end of the range and at the second instance, you're no longer at the low end of the range. And so the question that Rita raises is, in a case like that, is something a little bit more required, so that the judge says, you know what, I don't want to be at the low end of the range in -- in -- given this new range, because of the seriousness of the offense.  And the judge doesn't have to do that at length, as Rita said, maybe the judge doesn't even have to do it in writing, as long as the judge says something to give both the defendant and the appellate court some understanding of why the judge is doing what the judge is doing.   Elena Kagan  Well, it raises a question, don't you think?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Quite right.  And that's why the -- the court can say I don't think -- I don't want to go with the lowest point in the new range, and -- and that's absolutely the prerogative of the -- the district court.

Elena Kagan  It just seems a -- it's a minor requirement but one that seems as though it would help the appellate court quite a lot to know why the judge had chosen a sentence that was no longer at the low end of the range.

And I guess my question is, textually, why is that true? And sort of, you know, structurally, why should it be true, given, you know, sort of like a second shot at an appeal?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I guess I don't quite understand that just as a matter of language, something can be based on a legal error.   INTERRUPTING ",17-5716
0,"Elena Kagan  Well, General, I think that that might well be true, but I think it's -- it's also true in pretty much all of these districting cases.  In other words, in all of these districting cases, once there's a liability finding, there's a finding that a particular district is -- is drawn or more than one district is drawn in a way that violates the Constitution, the upshot of that is that you're not going to be allowed to use those district lines. But still there's a remedial process that takes place, where people argue about what the proper remedy is, and only at the end of that process, customarily, or at least it happened this way here, is there an injunction put in place saying don't use this map, instead use that map. And what I'm concerned about is that if you're right, we're going to be hearing all of these districting cases not after the remedial stage but, instead, straight away after the liability stage.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  General, if -- if I could --   Elena Kagan  General, if I could -- I'm sorry.  But I guess I -- you -- you were saying before you were interrupted, you said what distinguishes this case, and I guess I do want to know what does distinguish this case, or is -- if in finding that there's jurisdiction here, are we going to be finding that there's jurisdiction after the liability stage at all redistricting cases?   Elena Kagan  Well --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- but it --   Elena Kagan  It seems as though that that's a -- you're essentially saying that this PI opinion was a safe harbor for the state.  And that seems an odd thing to say. I mean, a PI opinion is just a PI opinion.  It's preliminary.  And this Court said multiple times that they're -- that it had not got -- gone through all the evidence, that it had not gone through all the facts, that this was just the best it could do at the stage it was at now. And so, to turn that around and to say this is a safe harbor for the state, isn't it essentially to stop every case at the preliminary injunction stage?   Elena Kagan  General, what -- what would you think -- let's put aside the court order for a second.  Just pretend it doesn't exist, which I realize is -- you know, that's an important feature of the case for you, but let's just pretend.   Elena Kagan  Suppose there's one map and -- and -- and then there's a second map, and the one map is later found to have all kinds of evidence of discriminatory intent surrounding it.  There are e-mails.  There's everything. The second map, nothing.  But the second map is exactly the same.  What should a court do with respect to the second map?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Should it just say there's no e-mails?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  I know it is.   ",17-586X
1,"Elena Kagan  Mr. -- Mr. Kneedler, that might be true.  It might have been a terrible decision to give only three days, but suppose that the court had given three weeks. Why would that have made a difference for this question of whether something is an injunction or has the practical effect of an injunction?   Elena Kagan  But, Mr. Kneedler, in -- in your briefs, you acknowledge two things. You acknowledge, first, that when there are two maps and they're exactly the same, that evidence of intent as to the first map is probative of -- of -- of intent as to the second map.  The question is always intent as to the second map, but if two maps are exactly the same, there's all kinds of evidence of bad intent as to the first map, surely that's probative. And I think you acknowledge that. Don't you think?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Of course.  Everything depends on the circumstances.  The -- the -- the facts, which, you know, this Court is the -- has principal authority over. The second thing that you acknowledge in your brief is that these court orders, especially at this preliminary stage, are not safe harbors.  Don't you think?   Elena Kagan  So, given that the district court has so much better understanding of the facts than we do, what do you think went wrong here? I'm trying to find the legal principle that went wrong.   Elena Kagan  But I don't think that it did that.  And I -- I recognize that there are some sentences which can be read either way.  But if I understand you correctly, you're suggesting that there was a shift in the burden of proof.  And that would be a legal error.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  But -- but -- but here's what they said.  The district court said: ""The plaintiffs can establish their claim by showing that the legislature adopted the 2013 plans with a discriminatory purpose, maintained the district lines with a discriminatory purpose, or intentionally furthered preexisting intentional discrimination."" So it's talking about here is the way the plaintiffs can establish their claim.  What happened in 2013?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, that might be right, Mr. Kneedler, that there's no presumption that comes from, but -- but it's -- it's surely evidence that one can take into account that the legislature didn't engage in any kind of deliberative process --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  -- after having done a map that's tainted with all kinds of discriminatory intent.

0,"Elena Kagan  May I turn, General, to the constitutional claims in this case?   Elena Kagan  And your principal response to the Establishment Clause claim is to cite Mandel and to say that, once the government comes forward with a legitimate reason -- of course, national security is the most important reason one can come forward with -- the game is over, essentially.  And I just want to press on that a little bit.   Elena Kagan  So, first, I want to ask whether that means -- you started off by talking a lot about the process of this proclamation.  But I -- I take it that that argument would apply irrespective of what process was used. In other words, you would have made the same Mandel argument to the first executive order in this case, or would you not?   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well, I guess I wonder why that is, just because, when I read Mandel, I don't see anything about process or you have to meet a certain kind of bar.   Elena Kagan  Mandel really is kind of you state a reason and this Court stops.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  So let me give you a hypothetical, and it's just -- you know, I think that there are ways to distinguish Mandel in this case, but -- but -- but, you know, just in terms of thinking about what Mandel really forecloses here.   Elena Kagan  I agree.  So this is a hypothetical that you've heard a variant of before that the government has, at any rate, but I want to just give you. So let's say in some future time a -- a President gets elected who is a vehement anti-Semite --   Elena Kagan  -- and says all kinds of denigrating comments about Jews and provokes a lot of resentment and hatred over the course of a campaign and in his presidency and, in the course of that, asks his staff or his cabinet members to issue a proc -- to issue recommendations so that he can issue a proclamation of this kind, and they dot all the i's and they cross all the t's. And what emerges -- and, again, in the context of this virulent anti-Semitism -- what emerges is a proclamation that says no one shall enter from Israel.   Elena Kagan  Do you say Mandel puts an end to judicial review of that set of facts?   Elena Kagan  Well, the question is --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Well --   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  Yes.   Elena Kagan  General, I'm -- let's -- this is a out-of-the-box kind of President in my hypothetical.  And -- (Laughter.)   Elena Kagan  And -- and, you know, he thinks that there are good diplomatic reasons, and there might -- who knows what the future holds, that there might be good diplomatic reasons to put pressure on Israel or to say we want Israel to vote a certain way in the U.N. and this is a way to better our diplomatic hand, and so this is what he does. And -- and who knows what his heart of hearts is.  I mean, I take that point.  But the question is not really what his heart of hearts is.  The question is what are reasonable observers to think --   Elena Kagan  -- given this context, in which this hypothetical President --   Elena Kagan  -- is making virulent anti-Semitic comments.   INTERRUPTING Elena Kagan  You -- you said something earlier, General, I want to make sure that I got it right.  You said if at the time the President had said we don't want Muslims coming into this country --   Elena Kagan  -- that that would undermine the proclamation.   Elena Kagan  Did I get you right?   Elena Kagan  So I -- I think, you know, honestly, the difference here then seems to be is everything that the President said effectively that?   INTERRUPTING ",17-965X
1,"Elena Kagan  Well, you might think --   Elena Kagan  I -- I guess the question, though, Mr. Katyal, is maybe you're entirely right that 1182(f) needs to have some limits to prevent the President from doing something that's completely contrary to another section of the statute. But you're suggesting, well, the President can't do anything that's not contemplated by the rest of the statute.   Elena Kagan  Okay.  So then I want to know, what are you saying this is directly contrary to? Because it seems to me you would have to point to some kind of clear and direct conflict --   Elena Kagan  -- between what the President is doing and another statutory provision.   Elena Kagan  And -- and yet, Mr. Katyal, you have a proclamation that says there are important national security interests at stake.  And the question is how to do the kind of analysis that you want us to do without in some sense evaluating the adequacy of those national security interests, which for the most part we've said courts are not equipped to do.
